"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we calculate the white fiber as 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% is the same as multiplying by 1.5)

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 2.5x

Divide both sides by 2.5: 
x = 52,000

So the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 (the cost of repairs)
Profit = 52,000 - 130,000
Profit = -78,000

However, the question asks for the profit, not the loss. Since Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, we should consider the profit as the value of the house after repairs minus the original cost of the house. 

Profit = 52,000 - 80,000
Profit = -28,000

However, this is still a loss. To find the actual profit, we need to consider the increase in value due to the repairs. 

The increase in value is $52,000 - $80,000 = -$28,000. However, this is a decrease in value. The increase in value is actually $52,000 - $80,000 = -$28,000.

"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James has 3 sprint sessions in a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. 

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed per meal. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the glasses. 

First, let's find the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass. The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide them into two groups: the first glass and the rest of the glasses. The first glass costs $5. The rest of the glasses are 16 - 1 = 15 glasses. 

The cost of the rest of the glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

Now, we can add the cost of the first glass and the cost of the rest of the glasses to find the total cost. The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we need to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. 

Total sheep = sheep in Toulouse + sheep in Charleston + sheep in Seattle
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20
Total sheep = 260

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Carla downloads 40% of the file in the first part. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB.
2. The time taken to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.
3. After 40 minutes, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.
4. Now, Carla has to download the remaining 60% of the file (200 - 80 = 120 GB).
5. The time taken to download 120 GB at 2 GB/minute is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.
6. The total time taken is the sum of the time taken in the first part (40 minutes), the time taken for the restart (20 minutes), and the time taken in the second part (60 minutes). 
   Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

1. First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered in this segment.

3. Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, we add up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month, so we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Initial cost of planting the tree: $90
Annual expenses (watering and feeding): $3
Annual earnings from selling lemons: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total expenses for each year, and then find the year in which the total earnings exceed the total costs.

Year 1:
Total cost: $90 (initial cost) + $3 (expenses) = $93
Total earnings: $10.5 (from selling lemons)
Net loss: $93 - $10.5 = $82.5

Year 2:
Total cost: $93 (previous year's cost) + $3 (expenses) = $96
Total earnings: $21 (2 years * $10.5 per year)
Net loss: $96 - $21 = $75

Year 3:
Total cost: $96 (previous year's cost) + $3 (expenses) = $99
Total earnings: $31.5 (3 years * $10.5 per year)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all three houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x - 6)/6 = (x - 3)/3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - 3)/3 = 5

To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 3. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

(3x - x - 6 - (x - 3))/3 = 5

Combine like terms:

(3x - x - x - 6 + 3)/3 = 5

Combine like terms:

(3x - 2x - 6 + 3)/3 = 5

Combine like terms:

(x - 3)/3 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

x - 3 = 15

Add 3 to both sides:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is also 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the potential value of each option after the market fluctuation. 

For the jewelry, the value will increase by 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125. So, the new value of the jewelry will be $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

For the electronic gadgets, the value will increase by 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96. So, the new value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to choose the option with the higher value. In this case, the electronic gadgets will be worth $8,096, which is higher than the jewelry's value of $5,125.

The profit is the difference between the new value and the original price. For the electronic gadgets, the profit will be $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"This problem seems to be a classic example of a lateral thinking puzzle. However, it's not a typical puzzle that requires a numerical answer. The question seems to be asking for the distance covered by each train in the two days, but it doesn't provide enough information to determine the individual distances covered by each train.

However, if we assume that the two trains are traveling in the same direction (westward) for the first day and then in the same direction (northward) for the second day, we can infer that they are traveling in a grid-like pattern.

In this case, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train in the two days. Let's denote the distance covered by each train as x and y.

For the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward, so the distance covered by each train is 80 miles.

For the second day, both trains travel 150 miles northward, so the distance covered by each train is 150 miles.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the total distance covered by each train in the two days:

√(80^2 + 150^2) = √(6400 + 22500) = √28900 ≈ 170 miles

However, this is the total distance covered by each train in the two days, not the individual distances covered by each train.

To find the individual distances, we need to consider the fact that the trains are traveling in a grid-like pattern. Since they are traveling in the same direction for the first day and then in the same direction for the second day, we can assume that they are traveling in a straight line for each day.

In this case, the distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles, and the distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual salary from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual salary from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks and then convert that number to dozens.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert 84 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total time Marissa has available to complete the hike. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles, the total time required would be 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours.

Marissa has already taken 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so she has used 2 hours. This means she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = 6 miles. To find the speed required to walk this distance in 1 hour, we divide the distance by the time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. 

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters. 

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we need to add the water from both the orange and pineapple drinks and subtract the 1 liter that was spilled. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Since we have 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total amount of liquid is 10 + 15 = 25 liters. After spilling 1 liter, we have 25 - 1 = 24 liters.

Since we have 14.67 liters of water in the mixture, the percentage of water in the mixture is 14.67/24 = 0.61 or 61%.

However, the question asks for the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, not the percentage. Since the mixture is 61% water, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 0.61 * 24 = 14.64 liters.

The final answer is: 14.64"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when Samantha was 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, he was 31 + 6 = 37 years old when Samantha was 31.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of the 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of the 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of pizza boxes, we need to divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box.

Number of pizza boxes = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide the total number of servings needed (60) by the number of servings per carton (15):

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the total number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 60 - 45
Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the second stop, but we want to find the distance traveled between the two stops, not the distance between the stops themselves. Since Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Distance traveled between the two stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop - Distance of the first stop
Distance traveled between the two stops = 15 - 20
Distance traveled between the two stops = -5 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop and then subtract the distance of the first stop from the total distance to find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the total distance to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 60 - 20 - 45
Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 60 - 65
Distance from the first stop to the second stop = -5 miles

However, this is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 - 20
Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 40 miles

Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 60 - 45
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 15 miles

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 20 + 15
Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 35 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the second stop, but we want to find the distance traveled between the two stops, not the distance between the stops themselves. Since Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Distance traveled between the two stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop - Distance of the first stop
Distance traveled between the two stops = 35 - 20
Distance traveled between the two stops = 15 miles

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the cost of the more expensive pair of heels be x dollars. Since the other pair costs twice as much, the cost of the less expensive pair is 2x dollars. 

We are given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x = boots - 5.

Combine like terms: 3x = boots - 5.

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33. Since the other pair costs twice as much, the cost of the more expensive pair is 2 * 33 = 66 dollars. 

Now we can substitute x = 66 into the equation: 3 * 66 = boots - 5.

Simplify the equation: 198 = boots - 5.

Add 5 to both sides of the equation: 198 + 5 = boots.

Solve for boots: 203 = boots.

The final answer is: 203"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio and total age. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, then 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time spent on each dog: 0.5 hours

Total time spent per day = Number of dogs * Time spent on each dog
Total time spent per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time spent per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time spent per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time spent per week = Total time spent per day * 7
Total time spent per week = 5 * 7
Total time spent per week = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins) and that the total number of coins is 110 (S + G = 110).

We can substitute the first equation into the second one: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins: G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20. So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to find the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts by 4: 60 / 4 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 * $5.00 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money John spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, we can calculate the total amount of money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he spent and the money he had left: $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets that he didn't spend on video games by subtracting the money he spent from the total amount of money he had before buying the video games: $195 - $165 = $30.

Since John made $30 from selling 13 Lego sets, we can calculate the number of Lego sets he sold for $30 by dividing $30 by $15: $30 / $15 = 2.

Since John originally had 13 Lego sets and he sold 2 of them, we can calculate the number of Lego sets he still has by subtracting the number of sets he sold from the original number of sets: 13 - 2 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by that time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total hours run per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Since John runs 60 miles a week, we can calculate his speed as follows:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:
Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

"To find out how many calories you can still consume, we need to subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target. 

Daily target: 2000 calories
Consumed calories: 1800 calories
Remaining calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories.

Remaining calories: 200
Calories per serving: 250
Number of servings: 200 / 250 = 0.8

Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.

Number of servings in a bag: 5
Number of servings you can have: 0.8
Fraction of the bag: 0.8 / 5 = 0.16

To find the grams, multiply the fraction of the bag by the total weight of the bag.

Total weight of the bag: 300g
Fraction of the bag: 0.16
Weight of chips you can eat: 300 * 0.16 = 48g

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles (2 sets of 10 candles). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes to write each article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find twice the number of articles, we multiply 7 by 2:
7 * 2 = 14
So, she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4:
26 * 4 = 104

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse.
2. She placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee at work, so she used 220 post-it notes.
3. After using 220 post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.
4. To find out how many post-it notes she had in total, we need to add the initial 80 post-it notes to the 23 remaining post-it notes: 80 + 23 = 103.
5. Since she used 220 post-it notes at work, the total number of post-it notes she had initially (including the ones in the package) is 103 + 220 = 323.
6. To find out how many post-it notes were in the package, we subtract the initial 80 post-it notes from the total: 323 - 80 = 243.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of blue ties John bought and the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of the red ties is 50% more than the cost of the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of the red ties is:

Cost of red ties = Cost of blue ties + (50% of cost of blue ties)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of red ties
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

Total cost = Cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM, and the time it takes for him to travel back.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, and we don't know the exact distance, we need to assume that the time he travels from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours). 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and his speed is 6 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed

Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480

Since the revenue from car tires on Friday ($480) is higher than the revenue from both truck and car tires on Thursday ($520), we need to compare the revenue from car tires on Friday with the total revenue on Thursday.

To find the difference, we subtract the revenue from car tires on Friday from the total revenue on Thursday: $520 - $480 = $40

"This question seems to be a math problem rather than a philosophical one. However, I can approach it from a philosophical perspective by considering the concept of ""remaining lollipops"" and the implications of packaging them.

From a philosophical standpoint, the question raises questions about the nature of quantity and the relationship between the initial amount of lollipops and the number of bags that can be filled. It also touches on the concept of ""remainder"" and how it affects the outcome.

However, to provide a numerical answer, we can simply perform the following calculation:

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, leaving 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in each bag, the number of bags that can be filled is 28 / 2 = 14.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of the jeweler is $800.
The cost of the insurance is 10% of the total cost so far, which is $500 + $800 = $1300. 
10% of $1300 is 0.1 x $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 + $800 + $130 = $1430.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then find 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the 5% increase after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she gets the standard $50,000/year pension. For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

First, let's calculate the total amount she would have earned in 20 years at the standard rate:

20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000

Now, let's calculate the value of the pension after 20 years. Since she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal (initial) amount, r is the annual interest rate (5% in this case), and n is the number of years.

However, in this case, we are looking for the value of the pension after 10 years of the 5% increase, not the total amount after 30 years. We can use the same formula to find the value of the pension after 10 years of the 5% increase:

A = $1,000,000(1 + 0.05)^10

A ≈ $1,628,929.92

Now, let's calculate 5% of this value:

5% of $1,628,929.92 ≈ $81,144.65

So, for the last 10 years, Marcy gets $81,144.65/year. For the first 20 years, she gets $50,000/year. To find her total annual pension, we need to add these two amounts:

$81,144.65/year + $50,000/year = $131,144.65/year

The final answer is: $131,145"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged 10% less money, which is 90% of the initial amount. So, the amount charged per month for the second half of the year is 0.9 * $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) of her car. We can do this by dividing the distance she has traveled since filling up (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used to fill up (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gallons = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 mpg

Now that we know the mpg, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the mpg by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons).

total distance = mpg * tank capacity = 25 mpg * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent each day and then multiply it by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour. So, the total time spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent on TV and reading in a week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the number of boys, we know there are twice as many boys as girls. Since there are 60 girls, there are 2 * 60 = 120 boys.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 60 + 120 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Bailey received from her weekly allowance. 

Weekly allowance: $5
Number of weeks: 8
Total allowance: $5 * 8 = $40

Since Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks, and she received $40 from her allowance, we can subtract the allowance from the total to find out how much she started with.

Initial amount = Total amount - Total allowance
Initial amount = $100 - $40
Initial amount = $60

"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the price per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes a day for 5 weekdays, which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes. 
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7425.

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year. 

First, let's calculate the number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. 
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Since the puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, we need to calculate the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year. 

The puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food for 365 - 180 = 185 days.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.
180 cups (first 180 days) + 2 cups/day * 185 days = 180 + 370 = 550 cups

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

From point 2, we can deduce that David does 1/4 of what Sarah does, since Sarah does 4 times as much as David. 

So, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

From point 1, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. 

So, Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. 

The difference is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better option.

To find the cost of 18 flowers at the better price, we multiply the cost per flower by the number of flowers: 18 * $0.5 = $9.

To find the cost of 18 flowers at the original price, we need to determine how many packages of 3 flowers and packages of 2 flowers Vincent needs to buy to get 18 flowers. Since 18 is divisible by 3, Vincent can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers. The cost of 6 packages of 3 flowers is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

However, since 18 is not divisible by 2, Vincent cannot buy a package of 2 flowers. Therefore, he will have to buy 6 packages of 3 flowers and 0 packages of 2 flowers.

The total cost of 18 flowers at the original price is $15.

To find the amount of money Vincent saves, we subtract the cost at the better price from the cost at the original price: $15 - $9 = $6.

"To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

Salary after 1 year: $600 + $60 = $660
Increase: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years: $660 + $66 = $726
Increase: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Time it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles + 2 seconds
Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 38 + 2
Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10% after changing his diet. To find out how much time it takes him to run the 400-meter hurdles after the improvement, we need to calculate 10% of the original time and subtract it from the original time.

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds
Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles after the improvement = Original time - 4 seconds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit: 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: x + 20 = 25.

Now, we can solve for x:

x + 20 = 25
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, not the first 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam: 25 - 20 = 5.

But we know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that were originally in the line is 30. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that were left in the line is 30 - 5 = 25. We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, so the number of cars that were left in the line after the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5. 

However, we know that 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, so the number of cars that were left in the line after the first 15 minutes is 30 - 5 = 25. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate our previous steps.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25. We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first determine how many potted plants she will have after giving away 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges. 

She starts with 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants initially. 

After giving away 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges, she will have 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants left.

Then, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. 

So, the total number of potted plants she will have left is 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times each friend pressed the doorbell and then add them up.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. 
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.
The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, who pressed the doorbell 20 times. 1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.
The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and 1 before bed, but he replaces one of those glasses with a soda. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 6 = 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 3-mile sections the city is divided into and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each section.

The city is 42 miles across, and it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles. 

First, we divide the total distance by the distance covered per time period: 
42 miles / 3 miles = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we multiply the number of sections by the time per section:
14 sections * 10 minutes/section = 140 minutes

"To find the total number of cookies both Cody and Amir eat, we need to determine how many cookies Cody eats and then add it to the number of cookies Amir eats.

Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookies as follows:

Cody's cookies = 3 * Amir's cookies
Cody's cookies = 3 * 5
Cody's cookies = 15

Now, we add the number of cookies Cody and Amir eat together:

Total cookies = Cody's cookies + Amir's cookies
Total cookies = 15 + 5
Total cookies = 20

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The length and width of the inner box would be (5 - 2) inches by (6 - 2) inches, since there is 1 inch of wall on each side. The height of the inner box would be (4 - 2) inches.

So, the inner dimensions of each box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The volume of each box is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Thursday, he watched 1 episode of a 1-hour show and 1 episode of a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

So, the total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

However, we are given that the total hours of TV watched is 7 hours. This means that the remaining 7 - 7.5 = -0.5 hours must be from Wednesday.

Since Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday, let's assume he watched x episodes. The total time for these episodes is 0.5 hours, which is equivalent to 30 * x minutes. Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can set up the equation:

30x = 0.5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.5 / 30
x = 1/60
x = 0.0167 (approximately)

However, since we are looking for the number of episodes, we can multiply x by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) and then round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't watch a fraction of an episode.

x = 0.0167 * 60
x ≈ 1

However, since we are looking for the number of 30-minute episodes, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't watch a fraction of an episode.

x = 1

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This means that the number of cookies he baked is 110 + 5 = 115.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2x + 15 = 115

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 115 - 15
2x = 100

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 100 / 2
x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback rewards for 10 gallons of gas at $0.20 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of the gas:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-up: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-up: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both of them. 
Total roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people).
Average roll-ups = 90 / 2 = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds, and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find out how many seconds it takes Julia to row 10 feet. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, it takes her 16 / 2 = 8 seconds to row 10 feet.

Now, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We can divide 64 by 8 to get the number of sets: 64 / 8 = 8.

Since Julia takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows, and she rows 8 sets of 10 feet, she takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50x, where x is the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total selling price of the lumber.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ratios and proportions. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, and the total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. To find the number of teaspoons of sugar used, we can set up a proportion:

7/20 = x/120

where x is the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to find x:

x = 840 / 20
x = 42

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30, so the number of vehicles imported on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3 times).

2. We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary was 1.3x, we can set up the equation 1.3x = 40000 to find Lylah's salary. Solving for x, we get x = 40000 / 1.3 = 30769.23 (approximately).

3. Now that we know Lylah's salary four years ago, we can find Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is 1.4 times his old salary. 1.4 * 40000 = 56000.

4. Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, so her new salary is 1.4 times her old salary. 1.4 * 30769.23 = 43059.12 (approximately).

5. To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their salaries together: 56000 + 43059.12 = 99059.12.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the number of sheets he uses in a month is:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

So, Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits, and Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep pattern.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which is 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

So, for Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

The rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, which is 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

So, for the rest of the week, she slept a total of 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours she slept throughout the week:

Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 28 hours

Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances Rosie runs at both speeds:
Total distance = Distance at 10 miles per hour + Distance at 5 miles per hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the number of letters Jennie put stamps on is equal to the number of letters in the already-stamped pile after she finished. 

Let's denote the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile as x. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters she put stamps on is 60 / 3 = 20.

The total number of letters in the already-stamped pile after Jennie finished is 30. This is the sum of the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile (x) and the number of letters Jennie put stamps on (20).

So, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 30.

To find the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile (x), we need to subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Julia initially had an unknown number of spoons, but we know she was out of them, so let's call the number of spoons in the package Julia bought 'x'.
2. Julia bought a package of 'x' spoons.
3. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia, so now she has 'x + 5' spoons.
4. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she has 'x + 5 - 3' spoons left.
5. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons, so we can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12.

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12
x + 2 = 12
x = 12 - 2
x = 10

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, we know that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
Then, we know that he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to first determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the profit made by the hospital, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost of the doctors from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors:
500 patients per day * 24 minutes per patient = 12000 minutes per day
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes to hours:
12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours per day

The cost of the doctors is the total hours spent by doctors multiplied by the hourly rate:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30000 per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount charged to patients:
500 patients per day * $200 per hour * 24 minutes per patient / 60 minutes per hour = 500 * $200 * 0.4 = $80000 per day

The profit made by the hospital is the total amount charged to patients minus the cost of the doctors:
$80000 - $30000 = $50000 per day

The final answer is: $50000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find a third of 60, we divide 60 by 3:
60 / 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit after being vomited on. The remaining number of elves is:
60 - 20 = 40

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. The number of elves left is:
40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, 30 elves are left.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.
3. The total mileage from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.
4. The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total mileage from Monday to Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday. So, 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, we calculate the total number of questions Mark could have completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

Since Mark had 75 questions in the first test, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

We calculate the total number of questions Mark could have completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions

Since Mark had 100 questions in the second test, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the number of incomplete questions from both tests: 
35 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 105 questions

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of pink gumballs in terms of the number of blue gumballs. 

Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so B = 12.

We are also given that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as P = 4B + 22.

Substituting B = 12 into the equation, we get P = 4(12) + 22.

First, we multiply 4 and 12: 4(12) = 48.

Then, we add 22 to 48: 48 + 22 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 700 bees in total.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
3. There are twice as many babies as queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From point 3, we know that B = 2Q.

From point 2, we know that W = 2B.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into the equation, we get 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples John has and then determine how many times he can harvest them within a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John has:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to determine how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide 12 by 3 to get the number of harvests:
12 months/year / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests/year

Now, we can multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests to find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 bees returned, so the number of bees that are still out is 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 45 (from steps 1-3) + 60 (from step 4) = 105 bees. However, 15 bees returned in step 3, so the number of bees that are still out is 60 (left in step 4) + 15 (from step 3) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can set up the equation:

"To determine who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances to the same unit. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries remained. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon ate is (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Solving for x, we get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for the two sets of days, which is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

Next, let's calculate the total length of the croissants: 
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes. Since each baguette is 2 feet long, we can convert it to inches: 
1 foot = 12 inches, so 2 feet = 24 inches
60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches: 
1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):

Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes for 2 months: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, the cost of the notebooks, and the cost of the bond paper, then add them together.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock from the number of tadpoles that came out from under the lily pad.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. 
6 tadpoles came out from under the lily pad, so now there are 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under the rock, so we subtract 2 from 17: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water, so the depth is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two-thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (2) and then divide by the denominator (3). 

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
= 19 + 13
= 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

Initially, the price of the bag of marbles is $20.

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the price becomes $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.2 * $24 = $4.80. So, the price becomes $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.2 * $28.80 = $5.76. So, the price becomes $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.2 * $34.56 = $6.912. So, the price becomes $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.2 * $41.472 = $8.2944. So, the price becomes $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.2 * $49.7664 = $9.95328. So, the price becomes $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.2 * $59.71968 = $11.943936. So, the price becomes $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616.

After 16 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.663616, which is 0.2 * $71.663616 = $14.3327232. So, the price becomes $71.663616 + $14.3327232 = $85.9963392.

After 18 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.9963392, which is 0.2 * $85.9963392 = $17.19926784. So, the price becomes $85.9963392 + $17.19926784 = $103.19560704.

After 20 months, the price increases by 20% of $103.19560704, which is 0.2 * $103.19560704 = $20.639121208. So, the price becomes $103.19560704 + $20.639121208 = $123.834728248.

After 22 months, the price increases by 20% of $123.834728248, which is 0.2 * $123.834728248 = $24.7669456496. So, the price becomes $123.834728248 + $24.7669456496 = $148.601673898.

After 24 months, the price increases by 20% of $148.601673898, which is 0.2 * $148.601673898 = $29.7203347796. So, the price becomes $148.601673898 + $29.7203347796 = $178.322008678.

After 26 months, the price increases by 20% of $178.322008678, which is 0.2 * $178.322008678 = $35.664401736. So, the price becomes $178.322008678 + $35.664401736 = $213.986410414.

After 28 months, the price increases by 20% of $213.986410414, which is 0.2 * $213.986410414 = $42.7972820828. So, the price becomes $213.986410414 + $42.7972820828 = $256.783692497.

After 30 months, the price increases by 20% of $256.783692497, which is 0.2 * $256.783692497 = $51.3567384994. So, the price becomes $256.783692497 + $51.3567384994 = $308.140430996.

After 32 months, the price increases by 20% of $308.140430996, which is 0.2 * $308.140430996 = $61.6280861992. So, the price becomes $308.140430996 + $61.6280861992 = $369.768517195.

After 34 months, the price increases by 20% of $369.768517195, which is 0.2 * $369.768517195 = $73.953703439. So, the price becomes $369.768517195 + $73.953703439 = $443.722220634.

After 36 months, the price increases by 20% of $443.722220634, which is 0.2 * $443.722220634 = $88.7444443268. So, the price becomes $443.722220634 + $88.7444443268 = $532.466665961.

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.47."
"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5. So, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. There are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for the Spanish flans and divide it by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session.

Sandra needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan and she needs to make 15 flans. So, the total number of eggs she needs is 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Since Sandra receives 9 eggs per babysitting session, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per session: 45 / 9 = 5.

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get the required number of eggs for the Spanish flans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2 and Seth's age will be S + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Jimmy has in relation to Ethel's money. 

Since Ethel has $8, we need to find twice that amount. Twice of $8 is 2 * 8 = $16.

"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho walks 20 miles a day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total miles he walks on weekdays is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), Pancho walks 10 miles a day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so the total miles he walks on weekends is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Thirtytwo (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade, and then find out how much they made per gallon. 

Let's start by finding out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. They made a profit of $25 and they sell each glass for $0.50. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon, they make 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon. 

Now, let's find out how many gallons they made in total. Since they made a profit of $25 and they make $10 per gallon, they must have made 25 / 10 = 2.5 gallons.

Now, let's find out how much they spent on lemons and sugar per gallon. They spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, so they spend 3 + 2 = $5 on lemons and sugar per gallon.

Since they made 2.5 gallons, they spent 2.5 * 5 = $12.50 on lemons and sugar in total. 

However, we are only asked to find out how much they spent on lemons. Since they spend $3 on lemons per gallon, they spent 2.5 * 3 = $7.50 on lemons.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the remaining amount after each expense.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500
   Remaining amount = 6000 - 1500 = 4500

2. He spends 1/3 on car fuel:
   1/3 of 4500 = 4500 * 1/3 = 1500
   Remaining amount = 4500 - 1500 = 3000

3. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 3000 = 3000 * 1/2 = 1500
   Remaining amount = 3000 - 1500 = 1500

4. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between them.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 or 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and the rabbits. 

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are distributed among the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are distributed among the rats. So, the number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

The cost of transporting the bags is $2x.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying and transporting the bags: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The trader sold the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the total revenue is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = $400 / $8 = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

2. Now, let's find out the total cost of the tickets and food. Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) = $36.

3. Next, let's find out the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

4. Now, let's find out the total cost of the entire trip. Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides = $36 + $66 = $102.

5. Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3. Cost per person = Total cost / 3 = $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends collecting peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ducks, we need to first calculate the total amount of insects needed per week and then divide that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The total amount of insects needed per week for the flock of ducks is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds.

Now, we divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7 to find the amount needed per day: 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years, and then subtract the number of trees that die.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in the number of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

After 10 years, the total number of trees will be the initial number of trees plus the net change in the number of trees per year multiplied by the number of years. 

Total trees after 10 years = 50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we need to calculate 30% of 130.

Number of trees that die = 0.3 * 130 = 39

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years to find the final number of trees.

Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 (pink) + 6 (white) = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

2. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
3. Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
4. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.
5. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.
6. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

The one-time monetary reward is $5000.

The 5% raise in salary is calculated as 5% of his weekly salary, which is 0.05 * $2000 = $100. This means his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Since he works every week of the year, there are 52 weeks in a year. His total earnings from his new salary would be $2100 * 52 = $109200.

Adding the one-time monetary reward to his total earnings from his new salary, we get $109200 + $5000 = $114200.

Therefore, John made a total of $114200 that year.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pens Janet had initially and then add the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 x 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 x 6 = 12.

The total number of pens Janet bought is 54 + 12 = 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'x'. 

Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, we can set up the equation:

20 * 12 * x = 6 * 6000 - 1200

First, let's simplify the equation by calculating the total cost of half a dozen plates:

6 * 6000 = 36000

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

240x = 36000 - 1200

Next, let's simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

240x = 34800

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 240 to find the cost of one cup:

x = 34800 / 240

x = 145

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

The total cost of the items Sara wants to buy is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes:
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more to buy the items.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so she earns a total of $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

To find out how much more money she needs to earn from mowing the lawn, we subtract the amount she earns from babysitting from the total amount she needs:
$60 (total needed) - $20 (from babysitting) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns per mowing:
$40 (amount needed from mowing) / $4 (per mowing) = 10

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first day, the second day, and the third day. However, we are not given the number of customers on the third day directly. We are given the total number of customers over the three days, which is 500.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of customers over the three days: x + (x + 50) + y = 500, where y is the number of customers on the third day.

However, we are given that Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day. So, we can substitute x = 100 into the equation: 100 + (100 + 50) + y = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 100 + 150 + y = 500.

Combine like terms: 250 + y = 500.

Subtract 250 from both sides: y = 250.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute in total.

In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 32 gallons.

The small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 32 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

2x - 32 = 4(x - 32)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 32 = 4x - 128

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-32 = 2x - 128

Adding 128 to both sides:

96 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

48 = x

So the initial amount of water in the small pool was 48 gallons. 

Since the small pool lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

48 - 32 = 16 gallons.

The final answer is: 16"

Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she borrowed with interest:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

However, this is the amount she borrowed with interest, not the amount she borrowed. To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the interest from the amount she borrowed with interest. 

$2200 - $200 = $2000

So, the remaining balance is $2000."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Adrian and Zack. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is twice Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years

He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces to the puzzle. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate is 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the combined rate. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3.

120 * 0.3 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. This means 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest after two months.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply 84 by 3/4.

84 * (3/4) = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. This means 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready for harvest after the two weeks.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. Total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. Tax on the cars: 10% of $240,000 = 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. Registration fees: 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000
4. Total cost: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. We know that Robert collected 20 shells on Monday and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert. 

Let's calculate the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday: 
Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells on Monday + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Now, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. We know that Kylie collected 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. 

Let's calculate the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday: 
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, and there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave, and then subtract that from the total number of penguins.

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.
Another one-third went inside the cave: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Total penguins that left: 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

Number of penguins left sunbathing: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per week and then divide that number by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed: 
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of how Ram is using the pens. He buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens. 

When he uses the 25 pens, he gets 5 new pens from the ink of the 5 empty pens. This means that the 5 empty pens are replaced by 5 new pens. So, the total number of pens remains the same, which is 25. However, the pens are not the same, as the 5 empty pens are replaced by 5 new pens.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Johnny starts with $20.
2. He adds an extra $10 to it, so now he has $20 + $10 = $30.
3. This sum of $30 triples in a year, so we multiply $30 by 3 to get the final amount.

$30 * 3 = $90

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
So, the remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
So, the remaining students are 700 - 420 = 280.

The rest of the students went out through exit C, which is 280 students.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we subtract James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week. 

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin now has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a certain number of fries, let's call it x. So, Griffin now has 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin now has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally apply the discount.

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the cost for each day is:
$250 * 6 = $1500

Since she needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks, the total number of days is:
4 days/week * 5 weeks = 20 days

The total cost before the discount is:
$1500 * 20 = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount:
10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

The final cost after the discount is:
$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Sue ate on both days and then calculate the total calories she consumed. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Since the school is 50% girls, the remaining 50% must be boys.

Let's find the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is 20 * 3 = 60.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, so the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, and 27 girls are in the first and second classes, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We know that the first class has 20 - 15 = 5 boys, and the second class has 20 - 12 = 8 boys.

The total number of boys in the first and second classes is 5 + 8 = 13 boys.

Since the total number of boys in the school is 30, and 13 boys are in the first and second classes, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 13 = 17 boys.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can equate it to 'x' and solve for 'x':

x = 12

Now that we know the number of cougars killed today, we can find the number of wolves killed today:

Number of wolves killed today = 3x = 3 * 12 = 36

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today:

Total animals killed = (10 + 15) + (36 + 12)
Total animals killed = 25 + 48
Total animals killed = 73

"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows each stall got, we divide the total number of cows bought (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, each stall got 4 new cows. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has half as many bananas as apples, so Jamal has 44 / 2 = 22 bananas.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, but this is not possible since he has fewer bananas than apples. This statement seems to be incorrect or misleading. However, we can proceed with the information we have.
5. Since Jamal has 22 bananas, and Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has 22 / 2 = 11 bananas.
6. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have. However, we are only given information about Andrea's apples and bananas, and Jamal's apples. We don't have information about Jamal's total number of fruits. But we can calculate the total number of fruits that Andrea has: 52 (apples) + 11 (bananas) = 63.

However, since we don't have information about Jamal's total number of fruits, we can't calculate the total number of fruits. But we can say that Andrea has 63 fruits.

However, since we are asked to find the total number of fruits, we can make an assumption that the statement ""Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples"" is incorrect and the correct statement is ""Jamal has 4 more apples than bananas"" which is consistent with the other information. 

If Jamal has 4 more apples than bananas, then Jamal has 22 + 4 = 26 apples. 

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 11 (Andrea's bananas) + 26 (Jamal's apples) + 22 (Jamal's bananas) = 111.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cups of flour needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she is making. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total cups of flour needed for today.

3 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 6 cups of flour for today

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she is making.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total cups of flour needed for tomorrow.

2.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow

Now, we add the total cups of flour needed for both days.

6 cups of flour for today + 5 cups of flour for tomorrow = 11 cups of flour

2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. 
   40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes.
   So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.
3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   The time it took to warm up the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   So, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to warm up the oil and cook the chicken:
20 minutes (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 minutes (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (to cook the chicken) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the total spent on newspaper ads and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to first find the total number of golf balls, and then find half of that number.

Since half of the balls are golf balls, and the juggler can juggle 16 balls, the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. So, the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in both houses is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows, which is 12 + 8 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.
5. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.
6. To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the whole sweater: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.
7. Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that do not have the letter A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:

R = 6S

From the second statement, we know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This means that Ruby's age in 9 years will be R + 9, and Sam's age in 9 years will be S + 9. We can write an equation based on this:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra. Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and the mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots, the cobra has 70 spots.

Total spots on cobras = 70 spots/cobra * 40 cobras = 2800 spots

Total spots on mambas = 35 spots/mamba * 60 mambas = 2100 spots

Total spots on all snakes = 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

Half the number of spots they all have combined = 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length taken up by the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The length taken up by the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the total length taken up by the beads (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch).

17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her 20 stories to 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his 40 stories to 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her 60 stories to 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the flag. 

The flag has three rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 

The flag has two rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

The weight of one flagstone is 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. 

Total weight of flagstones = 75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

The weight capacity of each truck is 2000 pounds. 

Number of trucks needed = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks needed = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

(1/10)x = 39
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults. Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and there are 4 adults, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be done by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Susan works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by her wage:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the points each player has after the third round and then add the extra points they receive in the fourth round.

After the third round, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. 
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

After the extra points are distributed, Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total number of points the three players have is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. 

Since Will bought 15 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members of the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 3 kg * 7 = 21 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (21 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 21 kg/week = 2 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 2 less working days. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the target per day and multiply it by 5. 

Target per day = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Target for 5 working days = 17.14 * 5 = 85.7 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will consider the target for 5 working days as 85 crates.

Now, let's find out how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week.

Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold

The final answer is: $1050"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the process of folding and unfolding the paper. 

When a piece of paper is folded, it creates two layers: the front and the back. When it is unfolded, these two layers become separate pieces of paper. 

In the case of a 32-page tabloid, we start with one piece of paper. When we fold it, we get two layers. 

To create a tabloid with 32 pages, we need to alternate the pages on the front and back of the paper. This means that we need to have an even number of pages on each side of the paper. 

Since we have 32 pages, we can divide 32 by 2, which equals 16. This means that we need 16 pages on each side of the paper. 

However, when we fold the paper, we get two layers, and we need to alternate the pages on these two layers. This means that we need to have 16 pages on the front and 16 pages on the back, but these pages are not the same as the original 32 pages. 

When we unfold the paper, we get two separate pieces of paper, each with 16 pages. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Elise sold in the first year. We know that she sold 45 books this year and there are 50 unsold books, so the total number of books she has sold in the past three years is 250 - 50 = 200. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90. 

The number of books she sold in the second year can be found by subtracting the number of books sold in the first and current year from the total number of books sold. So, 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books were sold in the second year.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

The final answer is: 1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by Joey by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

However, the question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in a single week. Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, the answer is 4 weeks.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount is $13 - $11 = $2 per tub.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of one packet of milk is not given, but it is sold at a discount of $0.5. If we assume the original price is x, then the discount is x - $0.5. However, since the question does not provide the original price of the milk packet, we can only calculate the discount per packet, which is $0.5.

If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total discount will be 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings will be the sum of the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of new arms and legs.

Total new limbs = 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so the total cost of the suits is 6 x $100 = $600.

2. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost of the suitcases is 3 x $50 = $150.

3. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, the cost of the flight ticket is 5 x $100 + $700 = $1500 + $700 = $2200.

4. The total amount spent so far is $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $2200 (flight ticket) = $2950.

5. Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for other expenses.

6. Since he has spent $2950 so far, he has $4000 - $2950 = $1050 left for buying gifts for his business partners.

The final answer is: $1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of people eating three eggs and the number of people eating two eggs. 

There are 5 people in the family. Three people eat three eggs each day, so the number of people eating three eggs is 3. The rest of the family, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat two eggs each day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the people eating three eggs per day: 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the people eating two eggs per day: 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs consumed by both groups: 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs per day.

Since the family eats eggs every day, we need to multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the total consumption in a week: 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age, and then add 5 to it. 

Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Let's denote Noah's current age as N. Since Cera is 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can write the equation:

N - 6 = 0.5 * (40)

2. Solve for N:

N - 6 = 20
N = 26

So, Noah is currently 26 years old.

3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, which is 26 * 3000 = 78,000.

4. The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Let's denote the current population of Chile as P. Then, the population six years ago was P/2. We can write the equation:

P/2 = 78,000

5. Solve for P:

P = 78,000 * 2
P = 156,000

The final answer is: 156,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. Let's call the number of players on the defense ""x"". Then, the number of players on the offense is 2x.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. So, the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We can set up an equation based on the total number of players:

x (defense) + 2x (offense) + x/2 (special teams) = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense."
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (marbles bought from Johanna) + 8 (marbles given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, we can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:
Nongendered children = (1/10) * Boys = (1/10) * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires will be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)
30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)
8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, the number of women who left is 15 - 8 = 7.

The question asks for the number of women left, so we need to find the number of women who stayed, which is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since we know the number of loose pencils, we can subtract those from the total to find the number of pencils in the boxes. 

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since each box contains an equal number of pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils per box.

24 (pencils in boxes) / 3 (boxes) = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of boxes needed, we need to add the number of pencils Jam and Meg have and divide by the number of pencils per box.

Total pencils = 24 (Jam's pencils in boxes) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 70 pencils.

Now, divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box to find the total number of boxes needed.

70 (total pencils) / 8 (pencils per box) = 8.75 boxes.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils are stored. 

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes needed:

65 / 13 = 5

Now, we know that each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since we need 5 ice cubes, we multiply 5 by 12 to find the total weakening caused by the ice cubes:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, we add this to the weakening caused by the ice cubes:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of old records to new records. The given ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. However, we need to find out how many times the ratio of 2 old records to 1 new record is used to get 7 new records. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of new records by the ratio of new records per trade, which is 1. So, 7 new records / 1 new record per trade = 7 trades.

Now, we know that each trade involves 2 old records. Therefore, the total number of old records is 7 trades * 2 old records per trade = 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people who got down is subtracted from the total: (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 6.

x = 14

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Then, her mother gives her 10 more, so she now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. After that, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she is left with 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which earned them $4 in rewards (since $80 / $20 = 4). 
2. They used these rewards on their current shopping trip, which means they had $4 off their current purchase.
3. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.
4. The total discount they got was $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.
5. They spent $43 on this shopping trip, but got a total discount of $12, so they paid $43 - $12 = $31.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A: 
- Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Gross income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal).
New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal).
New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of all Maria's shares.
Final value = 9 * 8 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total.
2. The animals are either chickens or cows.
3. He has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since there are twice as many chickens as cows).

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2C = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, and there are 20 cows, so the total number of legs from cows is 20 * 4 = 80.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and there are 40 chickens, so the total number of legs from chickens is 40 * 2 = 80.

The total number of legs from all animals is 80 (from cows) + 80 (from chickens) = 160.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the other animals and then add them to the weight of the container.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:

"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount percentage is 40%. 
To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$30 * 0.4 = $12 

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt: 
$30 - $12 = $18 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2: 
$18 * 2 = $36 

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase, we first need to calculate the daily revenue from selling tractors and silos.

Daily revenue from selling tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from selling silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Now, we need to find the difference in daily revenue and then calculate the percentage increase.

Difference in daily revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100
Percentage increase: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

The factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly expenses:

- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost is 25 * 4 = $100.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Total monthly expenses = Food cost + Treats cost + Medicine cost
Total monthly expenses = $100 + $20 + $100
Total monthly expenses = $220

Now, let's calculate the total yearly expenses:
Total yearly expenses = Total monthly expenses * 12
Total yearly expenses = $220 * 12
Total yearly expenses = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class: 1 hour
- Tuesday's cooking class: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event: 0.5 hours (half of 1 hour)
- Thursday's museum tour: half as long as the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday's errands: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

First, let's calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the school asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies, they need 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent: 
- The cost of the sweater: $11
- The amount given to her brother: $4
Total spent: $11 + $4 = $15

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: 
Initial amount: $36

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time John spent on all activities. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. John spent 6 hours boating.
2. He spent half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.
3. He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.
4. The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.
5. This is 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let's call the total time 'T'. Then, 30% of T is 15 hours.
6. We can write this as an equation: 0.3T = 15
7. To find T, we divide both sides by 0.3: T = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.
8. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. We can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 40% of T by 0.4: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, so her earnings from the first job are:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, so her earnings from the second job are:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Her total earnings from both jobs are:
$200 + $75 = $275

She already has $80 in her savings, so the total amount she has is:
$275 (earnings) + $80 (savings) = $355

To find out how much money she still needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:
$400 (phone cost) - $355 (total amount she has) = $45

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
2. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.
3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. To find the combined height of the two shorter trees, we add their heights: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.
4. Now, we multiply the combined height by 2 to find the height of the tallest tree: 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Dean spent on the toy cars and the teddy bears, and then add the extra money his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 
6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 
5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add the total amount Dean spent on toy cars and teddy bears: 
$12 + $5 = $17

Dean started with $28, so we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount: 
$28 - $17 = $11

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add this to the amount he had left: 
$11 + $10 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract that from the budget to find out how much money is left for friends. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. Subtracting the total cost of the activities from the budget, we get $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf, tokens, and go-karts), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend to find out how many friends she can invite: $60 / $30 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily allowance. 

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so she spends 4 x 25 cents = 100 cents or $1 per day on lollipops.

Her daily allowance is $5, and she spends $1 on lollipops, so she saves $5 - $1 = $4 per day.

If she saves for 5 days, she will save a total of $4 x 5 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. He has $10 and the candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he bought 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. So, the change he has is 10 - 1.5x.

2. After buying the candy, he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2. 

3. Since he took half of his change to buy the gumballs, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of his change. So, the amount he spent on gumballs is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

4. We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2. So, we can set up the equation: (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2.

5. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 10 - 1.5x = 4.

6. Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides: -1.5x = -6.

7. Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by -1.5: x = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the age of Carver's son be 'x'. 

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be written as an equation: 

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the age of the son, we need to solve for 'x'. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2: 
50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip and then multiply it by the number of trips it makes in a day. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes 3 trips a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service by the distance it travels in a day.

18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing is calculated by adding the amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds and then dividing by 2. 

Average stuffing for collie beds = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Total amount of stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the trip to his friend's house and the trip back home.

For the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

For the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Total time for the trip = Time to friend's house + Time back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

Total students = 96
Absent girls = 5
Absent boys = 4
Total absent students = 5 + 4 = 9

Total students present = Total students - Total absent students
Total students present = 96 - 9
Total students present = 87

We know that 43 out of the total 96 students are girls. So, the number of boys is 96 - 43 = 53.

Now, we need to find the number of boys present on Friday. We know that 4 boys were absent, so the number of boys present is 53 - 4 = 49.

"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and then add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
= 12 + 6

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refused to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has now. We know that Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. 

Let's denote the number of points Sara has as S, and the number of points Erin has as E. We are given that E = 3S + S (since Erin has three times more points than Sara). 

We also know that E = 14 (since Erin now has 14 points). 

So, we can write the equation as 14 = 3S + S. 

Combine like terms: 14 = 4S. 

Divide both sides by 4: S = 14 / 4 = 3.5. 

However, since Sara scored 8 points, this means that the initial statement that Erin has three times more points than Sara is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Erin now has 14 points and that she has three times more points than Sara. 

Let's denote the number of points Sara has as S. We are given that E = 3S + S. However, this is incorrect. Instead, we should say that E = 3S - S + S (since Erin has three times more points than Sara, but we need to add the points Sara has to get Erin's total). 

So, we can write the equation as 14 = 3S. 

Divide both sides by 3: S = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 

However, since Sara scored 8 points, this means that the initial statement that Erin has three times more points than Sara is incorrect.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

1. The cost of the picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880.
2. The cost of etching the picture frames: 44 frames * 20% of $20 = 44 * 0.2 * 20 = $176.
3. The cost of the pins: 2 pins * $5 per pin = $10.
4. The cost of the cords: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, so 11 seniors will receive cords. 11 cords * $12 per cord = $132.

Now, let's add the costs together: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the cost of the materials. Since making it DIY saves 20% of the original cost, we can find the materials cost by subtracting 20% of the original cost from the original cost.

Original cost = $400
Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = Original cost - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of pairs sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of pairs sold over the three days: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair consists of two shoes, we need to multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours from each day.

On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of dance practice.
On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of dance practice.
On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 40% of this is faulty. 

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. 

To find the value of the functioning pieces of equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value.

Value of functioning pieces = Total value - Value of faulty pieces
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of milk Mary collects from the two groups of sheep.

Half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk each, and the other half produce 2 kg of milk each. Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them is 30 / 2 = 15.

The 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each will contribute 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

The other 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each will contribute 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

To find the total amount of milk Mary collects, we add the milk from both groups: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of rolls left after feeding the children. Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 to her children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we need to multiply the number of rolls left by 8 to find the total number of pieces fed to the chickens. 

6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, and then add the apples she picked on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Let's start with Monday. We know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per apple. To find out how many apples she picked, we can divide the total amount she earned ($56) by the price per apple ($4).

Apples picked on Monday = Total amount earned / Price per apple
Apples picked on Monday = $56 / $4
Apples picked on Monday = 14

Now, we know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday. 

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
Total apples picked = 14 + 12 + 24
Total apples picked = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of socks that Lindsay has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, she has washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
= $1,825

Now, we need to find the total amount Karan has to pay, which is the principal plus the interest:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
= $5,475 / 5
= $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how many kilometers Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time she hiked. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

"To find the total number of pesos they have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos each of them has, and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos each of them has:
Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220

The total number of pesos they have together is: 130 + 220 = 350

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is given as $18.

Now, let's find the profit: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find the profit per hour. However, the profit per hour is the same as the profit per cup multiplied by the number of cups sold per hour. 

The profit per cup is $36 (total revenue) / 36 cups = $1 per cup. 

The profit per hour is $1 per cup * 4 cups per hour = $4 per hour.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many female members are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
Number of girls = 26

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find out how many people were initially performing. Let's call this number 'x'. We know that half of 'x' is equal to the number of girls minus the number of teachers who sing. 

x / 2 = 26 - 3
x / 2 = 23
x = 46

So, 46 people were initially performing. However, we need to find out how many people actually sang in the performance. Since half of the people performing can't make it, the number of people who sang is equal to the number of people performing minus half of the number of people performing.

Number of people who sang = Number of people performing - (Number of people performing / 2)
Number of people who sang = 46 - (46 / 2)
Number of people who sang = 46 - 23
Number of people who sang = 23

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages James delivers to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

Next, we need to find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio. 

165 / 11 = 15

Now, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have by multiplying the value of one part by their respective parts in the ratio. 

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling, which means he pays 80% of the total cost. 

To find 80% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.8. 

$20 * 0.8 = $16

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $16. 

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus to find the total cost of the streaming services. 

$10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cable package to find the savings. 

$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

The final answer is: $34"

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica had 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has now:

Initial cards + cards from dad - cards given away + cards received

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
She gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

Since the pizza originally had 12 slices, the number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3.

"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine Alice's age. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows: 
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we can calculate Alice's age as follows:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since there are 8 hours of usage per day, the energy used per day is 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage per day is 3 hours. The energy used per day is 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we can divide 20 by 4 to get the total number of sandwiches needed.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

He then bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

The number of corns he bought is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns. 

Now, Allan has 80 (initial corns) + 60 (new corns) = 140 corns.

The total number of cannolis is 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

So, he has completed 5,000 steps. He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

Now, he has completed a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

He still has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the steps he took during his jog must be equal to the remaining steps he needs to reach his goal.

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 2,000.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport, and then subtract that from the time he has available.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees who remained after June and their total hours worked.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. So, 40 - 10 = 30 employees remained.

Each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks in May, which is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to the employees in May is 40 * 160 * $15 = $9600.

In June, the remaining 30 employees worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, which is 30 * 160 = 4800 hours. The total amount paid to the employees in June is 30 * 4800 * $15 = $216000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $9600 + $216000 = $225600.

The final answer is: $225600"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sally bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since Sally bought 2 pounds, she gets 1 pound at the regular price of $3 and 1/2 pound at half off. The half-off price is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally initially had $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks. The total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that number by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. To find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days, we multiply 2 cookies per night by 30 nights:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

However, the problem states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles will explode. But we are interested in the candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, and 1% of the candles explode, we need to find the overlap between these two groups.

To find the overlap, we need to find the number of candles that smell like wet dog and then multiply it by the probability of a candle exploding. However, since the probability of a candle exploding is not independent of the probability of it smelling like wet dog, we need to find the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding.

Let's assume that the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 5% and the probability of a candle exploding is 1%. However, since the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding is not given, we need to make an assumption. 

One way to approach this is to assume that the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding is the product of the individual probabilities. This is known as the independence assumption. However, this assumption may not be valid in this case, as the presence of a defect that makes a candle smell like wet dog may also increase the likelihood of it exploding.

Under the independence assumption, the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding is 0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005.

Now, we can multiply this probability by the total number of candles to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode: 0.0005 * 50,000 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$20 * 0.30 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:
$20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost:
$14 * 4 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30. 

We also know that Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees as from the tallest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We are given that Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so the sister gathered 2T apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60.

We are also given that the sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so the sister gathered 3S apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45.

Since the sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, her total is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

We know that the combined total of the sisters is 500 apples. So, Joanne's total is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees, so the number of apples she gathered from the average trees is 395 - 30 - 15 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the size of Zack's locker first, and then use that to find the size of Timothy's locker.

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Zack's locker = 4 * Peter's locker
Zack's locker = 4 * 5
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can set up the equation:

Timothy's locker = 2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 40 cubic inches

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. 

The first bank gave him $4000. 

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, let's add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $16000 in capital.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 x 5 = 20.

Now, let's subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

After the boats left, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats ran after the mouse, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30. 

3/5 of 30 is (3/5) * 30 = (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Now, let's subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months are $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months are $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years of the service: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fractions: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides of the equation: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans (T = 8), we can find the cost of the jogger jeans (J) using the equation J = T - 6: 
   J = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then calculate the total number of birds.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).

The total number of birds in the garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders: 3x + 3(x + 10).

Combine like terms: 3x + 3x + 30 = 6x + 30.

Since each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, we can set up the equation: 6x + 30 = 20(6).

Solve for x: 6x + 30 = 120.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 6x = 90.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: 3(x + 10) = 3(15 + 10) = 3(25) = 75.

The total number of birds in the garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders: 3x + 3(x + 10) = 6x + 30 = 6(15) + 30 = 90 + 30 = 120.

However, this is the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders. Since each feeder attracts 20 birds, we can multiply the total number of feeders by 20 to get the total number of birds: 6 * 20 = 120.

However, this is the number of birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. So, the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 20, and the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 30. The total number of birds is 3 * 20 + 3 * 30 = 60 + 90 = 150.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Kenny has $50 in spending cash and needs $100 to buy the ticket, so he needs to make $50 from selling the cards.
2. He plans to sell each card for $1.5, so the number of cards he needs to sell to make $50 is $50 / $1.5 = 33.33. Since he can't sell a fraction of a card, he needs to sell at least 34 cards to make $50.
3. However, Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sells is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with.
4. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, 2/3 of x is equal to 34 (the number of cards he needs to sell).
5. We can set up the equation: 2/3x = 34
6. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2: x = 34 * (3/2)
7. x = 51

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. 

So, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 18 guests to have two hotdogs each, which is a total of 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 guests are now eating two hotdogs each, which is a total of 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, there are not enough hotdogs for all 40 guests to have a second hotdog. To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we need to find out how many hotdogs are left over.

Since there are 80 hotdogs needed and only 36 hotdogs prepared, the number of hotdogs left over is 80 - 36 = 44. However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog.

Since there are 40 guests and 36 hotdogs, we can find the number of guests who got a second hotdog by dividing the number of hotdogs by 2 (since each guest gets 2 hotdogs). 36 / 2 = 18. This means that 18 guests got a second hotdog.

To find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the number of guests who got a second hotdog from the total number of guests. 40 - 18 = 22.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount, and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
   - The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
   - The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
   - The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
   - The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
   - To find 20% of $165.00, multiply $165.00 by 0.20: $165.00 x 0.20 = $33.00.
   - Subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, Charlotte's order was $132.00."

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we multiply the number of gallons per container by 8 to find the number of pints per container.

3 gallons/container * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints/container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower, so we multiply the number of pints per container by 1/4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, he must have had $100 initially. 

Now, let's calculate how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20. 

Since he had $100 initially and had $5 left, he spent $100 - $5 = $95 on chips and candy bars. 

Now, let's subtract the cost of chips from the total amount spent: $95 - $1.20 = $93.80. This is the amount he spent on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars he bought by dividing the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $93.80 / 0.75 = 125.

The final answer is: 125"

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. 
Margareth has 140 beads and Elizabeth has 60 beads. 
The difference is 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

2. The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature becomes 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

3. Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the house cools down 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

4. After cooling down, the final temperature of the house is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each part of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we need to find 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 x 40 = 4 minutes. 

So, James took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes to complete the swim.

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. So, James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes to complete the bike ride.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon was 10 minutes more than the total time it took Jon. 

The total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 

Since James took 10 minutes longer than Jon, the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We already know that James took 36 minutes to complete the swim and 85 minutes to complete the bike ride. To find out how long it took James to complete the run, we need to subtract the time it took him to complete the swim and bike ride from the total time it took him to complete the triathlon.

So, the time it took James to complete the run is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the horse runs, the total amount of hay it eats, and the total cost of the hay. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours since the speed is given in miles per hour. 

30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money Michael has: 
Change = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the dozen cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 

50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out.

10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we need to calculate the difference between his score and Marcy's score after their turns.

Initially, Joey has 214 points and scores 26 points, so his new score is 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy has 225 points and scores 10 points, so her new score is 225 + 10 = 235 points.

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score: 240 - 235 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, so the revenue from this sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31. These were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. The revenue from this sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue from the sale of all the sneakers is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each and the four packets with sixteen pieces each.

For the six packets with eight pieces each, the total number of crayons is 6 * 8 = 48.

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each, the total number of crayons is 4 * 16 = 64.

To find the total number of crayons, we add the number of crayons in the two types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

Since the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket alone is $20 - $1 = $19. 

Now, let's consider the cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a soda and popcorn at regular price. The total cost in this case is $12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn price) = $18 (total cost without the super ticket).

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

12 + 3 + x = 18

Combine like terms:

15 + x = 18

Subtract 15 from both sides:

x = 3

So, the regular price of popcorn is $3."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price:

Total cost = New cost * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the value of the sapphires and rubies Jenna has after the trade.

Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires worth $800 each, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400.

Now, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (8 - 3 = 5) worth $4000 (5 * $800 = $4000).

She also has 2 rubies worth $1200 each, so the total value of her rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of all her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

However, we need to subtract the value of the 3 sapphires she traded, which is $2400, from the total value of her jewels. 

$6400 - $2400 = $4000.

The final answer is: $4000"
"This question appears to be a simple arithmetic problem, but let's break it down step by step.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. To find out how many apples they eat in a day, we need to add their individual consumption:

Marin's consumption: 4 apples/day
Nancy's consumption: 4 apples/day
Total consumption per day: 4 + 4 = 8 apples/day

Now, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. To do this, we multiply their daily consumption by 30:

Total consumption in 30 days: 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we need to find the percentage of puppies that have spots out of the total number of puppies. 
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
= (7 / 20) * 100
= 35%

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight of feed / Truck's capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda a week. In a month, she drinks 3 * 4 = 12 aluminum cans. Since each can is worth 2 cents, she earns 12 * 2 = 24 cents from aluminum cans in a month.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week. In a month, she drinks 5 * 4 = 20 plastic bottles. Since each bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 20 * 3 = 60 cents from plastic bottles in a month.

To find her total earnings, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the length of the shark is given in feet, we'll convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, each 0.5 feet long, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of children
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to subtract the total amount they have already earned from their goal. 

First, let's add the amount Keegan and Tasha have earned: 
$83 (Keegan) + $91 (Tasha) = $174

Now, let's subtract the total amount they have earned from their goal: 
$200 (goal) - $174 (total earned) = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to first determine how many songs he currently has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Since Luri's player can store up to 100 songs, he can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the oranges, and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= 2 * 12
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange:

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount per orange
= 24 * 10
= 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is 12 * 5 = 60 miles.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed. 

Total hours = Total miles / Speed
Total hours = 60 miles / 10 miles per hour
Total hours = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how many bags of oats are needed per day, we divide the total amount of oats consumed per day by the weight of one bag, which is 50 pounds. So, 40 / 50 = 0.8 bags per day.

To find out how many bags of oats are needed for five days, we multiply the number of bags needed per day by the number of days: 0.8 * 5 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = 2/3 * 27

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4. So, the remaining amount is $12 - $4 = $8.

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

$8 / $2 = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the two trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is 24 * 2 = 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 can fit on the trays, so the number of eggs that won't fit is 64 - 48 = 16.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the discount and then divide by the total number of razors.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather only pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00. 

However, she also has a $2.00 coupon, so the effective cost of 2 packs is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs contain 8 razors. 

Now, let's convert the cost to cents: $2.00 = 200 cents.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors: 200 cents / 8 razors = 25 cents per razor.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them together.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add the heights of all the levels together: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Angela's current age as A. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This means that in four years, Angela's age will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since we know that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old, we can set up an equation to find her current age:

A + 4 = 42

To find Angela's current age, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

A = 42 - 4
A = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of oranges both Ashley and Brianne brought and then divide that number by 3 (since one pie needs 3 oranges).

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). 

For the second venue, the total cost is $25x (per person charge).

To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L. 

We know that together they collected 43 insects, so L + D + B = 43.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Since D = B/2, we can substitute this into the equation: (B/2) + 7 + B/2 = 43.

Combine like terms: (3B/2) + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3B/2 = 36.

Multiply both sides by 2: 3B = 72.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 24.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Now that we know D, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total amount of yarn used, we need to calculate the amount used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To find the total amount used, we need to add these fractions together. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for 1/4 and 1/2. The least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4. So, we can rewrite 1/2 as 2/4.

Now, we can add the fractions: 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 3/4 by 364 to find the total amount of yarn used.

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator by the whole number and keep the denominator the same: (3/4) * 364 = (3 * 364) / 4 = 1092 / 4 = 273.

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost of the strawberry gum is 2x.

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. Since half of $2 is $1, the cost of the green apple gum is $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x (cost of strawberry gum) + 2 (cost of grape gum) + 1 (cost of green apple gum) = 7

Combine like terms:

2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 2

So each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
For a 2 x 8, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 gives him the most sticks per dollar, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 pieces of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:

$24 / $6 = 4

Since he can buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood, he can get 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks from the 2 x 8 wood.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12 (since each pair consists of 2 snowshoes).

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair: 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cows at the zoo and the number of sheep at the farm.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, and the farm has 30 cows. So, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, and the zoo has 20 sheep. So, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we need to find the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals at the farm is 30 + 10 = 40.

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals at the zoo is 60 + 20 = 80.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, Rose bought 4x items. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. 

We can set up the equation: 4x = 16. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

So, Sophia bought 4 items. Since Sophia bought a mix of onions and potatoes, we can assume that she bought 4 items in total, which could be a combination of onions and potatoes. However, we cannot determine the exact number of each item without more information."
"To determine the number of days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to calculate the time between December 31st and July 19th. 

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

So, the total number of days is 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories in total.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522 calories.

The final answer is: 522"
"This question seems to be a math problem rather than a philosophical one. However, I can still provide an answer.

Since Gerald works 7 days a week and earns $30 per day, his total earnings for the week would be:

7 days * $30/day = $210

Gerald spent a total of $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, Julie spent 20% of her initial $500 on clothes. 

20% of $500 = 0.20 * 500 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes, leaving her with $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

25% of $400 = 0.25 * 400 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs, leaving her with $400 - $100 = $300.

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the oatmeal cookies require 3/4 of a cup of raisins per batch. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for the oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins are available for the oatmeal cookies. Since each of the three items gets 9 cups, and the oatmeal cookies are one of them, they get 9 cups. However, the question asks how many batches she can make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix. This means the total raisins available for the oatmeal cookies is 27 - 9 - 9 = 9 cups. 

Now, we can divide the available raisins by the amount needed per batch: 9 / (3/4) = 9 / 0.75 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then find the difference in cost.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
After adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Now, let's convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is equal to 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Next, we need to determine how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Then, the number of sofas she has is x - 2. We know that the number of sofas Ophelia has is 20, so we can set up the equation x - 2 = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 22.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find out how many chairs Jenna has. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has by subtracting 2 from the number of chairs she has. So, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now that we know the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs. The total number of sofas is 20 + 64 = 84, and the total number of chairs is 22 + 66 = 88.

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 84 + 88 = 172.

The final answer is: 172"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many CDs Tom could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Let's denote the number of CDs Tom bought as 'x' and the number of headphones as 'y'. We know that the total cost is $48, and the cost of one CD is $4. 

We can set up the equation: 4x + y = 48

We also know that Tom bought one headphone set, so y = 1.

Substituting y = 1 into the equation, we get: 4x + 1 = 48

Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, we get: 4x = 47

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get: x = 11.75

Since we can't buy a fraction of a CD, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for how many more CDs he could buy, so we'll keep the decimal.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $48. With the money he spent on the headphone set ($4), he could buy 1 CD. 

So, the number of CDs he could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set is 1. 

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CDs he bought. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $52. With the money he spent on the CDs ($4 * 11.75 = 47), he could buy 11.75 CDs.

The difference between the number of CDs he could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set and the number of CDs he could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CDs he bought is 11.75 - 1 = 10.75.

The final answer is: 10.75"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the weeks where he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. 

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 4 hours. Since there are 8 weeks in total, and we know that he didn't spend 4 hours in all 8 weeks, we need to find out how many weeks he spent 4 hours. 

We know that he spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, and 6 hours in one week. This means that he spent 4 hours in 8 - 3 = 5 weeks. 

So, the total hours spent in the 5 weeks where he spent 4 hours is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

In the two weeks where he spent 5 hours, the total hours spent is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

In the one week where he spent 6 hours, the total hours spent is 6 hours.

Now, we add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (who were already there) + 40 (who got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer than 21 is 21 - 3 * 21 = 21 - 63 = -42. However, you can't have a negative number of people getting on the bus, so this means that no one gets on the bus at the second stop.

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 59.

The final answer is: 59"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J8 and his cousin's age in 8 years as C8. 
   We know that C8 = 2 * J8 - 5.
3. Since Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30, we can substitute J8 = 30 into the equation from step 2.
   C8 = 2 * 30 - 5 = 55.
4. Now we know Jame's cousin's age in 8 years is 55, so his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.
5. To find the difference in their current ages, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age: 47 - 22 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since Errol bought the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400, the total cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, the number of girls and boys is 20 / 2 = 10 each.

2. The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

4. To find the number of shells brought by the girls, we need to calculate 4 * 60 = 240.

5. Now, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to the number of shells brought by the girls: 600 + 240 = 840.

6. Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find the number of shells brought by each girl: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's denote the number of candies George had initially as 'x'. Then, Nick had 2x candies.

2. George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5.

3. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 3.

4. To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation: x - 5 = 3. Adding 5 to both sides of the equation gives us x = 8.

5. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George initially, Nick had 2x candies. Now that we know x = 8, we can find the number of candies Nick has: 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age, and then add 2 years to it.

Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. So, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the target of 72.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target:

72 - 54 = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in total for the first half of the month. Since April has 30 days, the first half of the month will have 15 days. 

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Then, in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day. 

The total amount saved in the first half of the month is 15x. The total amount saved in the second half of the month is 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is 15x + 30x = 45x.

We know that Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in the month. So, we can set up the equation:

45x = 1125

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

This is the amount Elvis needs to save per day in the first half of the month. Since he needs to save twice as much in the second half, the amount he needs to save per day in the second half is 2x = 2 * 25 = 50.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, Jairus's total earnings = 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny's total earnings = 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings: 16 - 10 = 6.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount of money they have is 100 dollars, so the sum of the money Jeff and Brad get is equal to 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x:

Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 + 26 = 52 letters in the first two steps.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 13 letters. So, she writes 13 letters in the third step.

3. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two steps and the 13 letters from the third step. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

4. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from the first two steps (52), the letters from the third step (13), and the re-written letters (65). 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set that Jonathan wants. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan wants a play set five times larger, we can multiply 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

This means Jonathan wants a play set with 400 toys. However, he already has some toys and needs 2 more to reach this number. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 2 = 400

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. 

Twice as long as it takes him to swim a mile in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 

2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and swimming 3 miles in cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Assuming each child needs a certain number of candles based on their age, let's assume a standard number of candles per age. For simplicity, let's assume each child needs 12 candles (this is a common number for birthday candles). 

So, James needs 12 candles for the 12-year-old and 12 candles for the 8-year-old, totaling 12 + 12 = 24 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (24) by the number of candles per pack (5). 

24 / 5 = 4.8

Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 5 packs of candles to have enough for both sons.

Now, to find out how much James spends on candles, we multiply the number of packs he needs to buy (5) by the cost per pack ($3).

5 * 3 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows: 
(105 minutes / 1.5 minutes) * 2 pages = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week: 
140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many Cody and Trevor ate, and then subtract that from the total number of sandwiches.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

So, there are 5 sandwiches left.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the nephew's current age as 'x'. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, the nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Now, let's solve for x:

51 = 3x + 21

Subtract 21 from both sides:

30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

10 = x

So, the nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:

$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. 

Let's start with Anna. We know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation to find out how many goals Anna scored:

Richie's goals - 45 = Anna's goals
80 - 45 = Anna's goals
Anna's goals = 35

Now, we know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, we can set up another equation to find out how many goals Mark scored:

Richie's goals - 20 = Mark's goals
80 - 20 = Mark's goals
Mark's goals = 60

Now that we know how many goals each of the three teenagers scored, we can add them up to find the total number of goals:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84.

Now, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures and the total amount of money he has left to spend on plastic action figures.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days in this period, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

Peter started with $70 and spent $20 on wooden action figures, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left. Since he has 3 days left in the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), and each plastic action figure costs $2, he can buy $50 / $2 = 25 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so he will have 4 + 25 = 29 action figures by the end of the week.

The final answer is: 29"
"To determine the total cost of the kitten, we need to calculate the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"This question seems to be a mathematical problem rather than a philosophical one. However, I can still provide a philosophical perspective on the concept of money and savings.

From a philosophical standpoint, the concept of money and savings can be seen as a human construct, a tool created to facilitate trade and exchange. The value of money is often tied to societal norms and cultural values. In this sense, the question of how much money Katina will have after 2 years is not just a matter of arithmetic, but also reflects the underlying values and priorities of her society.

However, to provide a more practical answer, let's calculate the amount of money Katina will have remaining in her account after 2 years.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, she will remove a total of 24 months * $100 = $2400.

To find the amount of money remaining in her account, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese/condiments: $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The revenue per sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit per sandwich is the revenue per sandwich minus the total cost per sandwich: $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70 per sandwich.

Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total revenue is 10 x $7.00 = $70.00, and the total cost is 10 x $3.30 = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that number by the price of each muffin crayon.

Since Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons.

She melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin crayon, so the total number of muffin crayons she can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

Since each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, Kate can make 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we first need to determine the number of cards each person has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and add it to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

However, since temperature is usually measured in whole numbers, we can round this to the nearest whole number.

"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to that gives us:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time as follows:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to that gives us:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. So, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44. So, the total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have, and then the total cost of the contacts.

Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day. 

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since there are 2 contacts per pair, Pete uses 1 pair per day.

If Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, he will have a total of 180 contacts (2 boxes * 90 contacts per box). 

Since he uses 1 pair per day, he will have 180 pairs of contacts (180 / 2 = 90 days * 2 pairs per day).

The original price of 2 boxes is $200.00 (2 boxes * $100.00 per box). 

Since there is a 10% discount, the discount amount is $20.00 (10% of $200.00).

The final price of 2 boxes is $180.00 ($200.00 - $20.00).

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the final price by the total number of pairs of contacts: 

$180.00 / 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burns during the activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are. 

1600 / 200 = 8

Since each 200-calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find the total water needed.

8 * 100 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Dachshund's weight is 4 times the Papillon's weight. 

Since the Papillon's weight is unknown, let's call it x. The Dachshund's weight is 4x. 

The Dachshund's weight is also twice the Affenpinscher's weight, so the Affenpinscher's weight is 2x/4 = x/2. 

The Affenpinscher's weight is given as 10 pounds, so x/2 = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 20. 

The Papillon's weight is x = 20 pounds. 

The Mastiff's weight is 44 times the Papillon's weight, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 20 = 880 pounds.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x. Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
Another angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / cost of one gumball

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve gets each year and then add them up over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 12 games for saving money (1 game per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the first year is 5 + 12 + 5 = 22.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 24 games for saving money (2 games per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the second year is 5 + 24 + 5 = 34.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 48 games for saving money (4 games per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the third year is 5 + 48 + 5 = 58.

Now, we add up the total number of games Steve gets over the three years: 22 + 34 + 58 = 114.

The final answer is: 114"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the plane is traveling. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the rate, we can find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we first need to find out how much each of them makes in 12 hours.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2, which is 60 pounds per hour. 

Now, we multiply 60 pounds per hour by 12 hours to find out how much Ruiz makes in 12 hours: 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, Marissa makes 3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds in 1 hour. 

Now, we multiply 90 pounds per hour by 12 hours to find out how much Marissa makes in 12 hours: 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours: 720 + 1080 = 1800 pounds.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Howard spent at the arcade and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Howard originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total revenue from each period, then add them together.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total revenue in the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total revenue in the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Total revenue from selling lemonade for 6 hours = Total revenue in the first four hours + Total revenue in the next two hours
Total revenue = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply the number of rotations per month by 12 to find the total number of rotations per year.

290,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 3,480,000 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years the tire will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 3,480,000 rotations/year = 3 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Joe is purchasing, then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. The final cost is $42.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money he has: $50 - $42 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make and then determine how much butter is required for that amount.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants he wants to make is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we need to first find out how many dozen croissants that is:
336 croissants / 12 = 28 dozen

Now, we can multiply the number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
28 dozen * 1/4 pound/dozen = 28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

To find how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract that from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street: 
$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.
2. The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it took 5 * 10 = 50 months.
3. The first 5 months had a fixed funding of $100,000.
4. For the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45), the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for each of these months is 1.5 times the previous month's funding.
5. To calculate the total funding for the remaining 45 months, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.
6. In this case, a = $100,000 (the funding for the first month after the initial 5 months), r = 1.5 (the increase in funding each month), and n = 45 (the number of months with increased funding).
7. Plugging in the values, we get S = 100,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / (1 - 1.5).
8. Calculating the value of 1.5^45 gives us approximately 1.071508.
9. Plugging this value back into the formula, we get S = 100,000 * (1 - 1.071508) / (1 - 1.5) = 100,000 * (-0.071508) / (-0.5) = 100,000 * 0.143016 = 14,301.6.
10. The total funding for the remaining 45 months is approximately $14,301.60.
11. To find the total cost of the research, we add the initial funding and the funding for the remaining months: $100,000 + $14,301.60 = $114,301.60.

The final answer is: $114,301.60"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by the first, second, and third players. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of meat. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

The total amount of meat consumed is 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week and add the growth from each week.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"To find the number of students, we first need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. 

Total number of seats = 4 rows * 18 seats per row = 72 seats.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats.

Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats.

Remaining seats (occupied by students) = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he will chew 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

3. So far, Jim has chewed 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

4. He started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them:
Profit = Selling price - Cost to acquire
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profit:
Commission = Profit * 0.1
Commission = $175,000 * 0.1
Commission = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (which is 25% expressed as a decimal).

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6 (which is 60% expressed as a decimal).

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom, and then use that to calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up.

Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

The distance between them is 75 miles. To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

"To find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss, we need to determine the maximum cost per class that his parents are willing to pay. Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class is more than $10, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the number of classes Manny misses. The total cost of the classes will be the cost of the classes he attends (10 - x) times the cost per class, which is $60 / (10 - x). We want this to be less than or equal to $10.

60 / (10 - x) ≤ 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x) to get:

60 ≤ 10(10 - x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

60 ≤ 100 - 10x

Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us:

0 ≤ 40 - 10x

Subtracting 40 from both sides gives us:

-40 ≤ -10x

Dividing both sides by -10 (remembering that this reverses the inequality sign) gives us:

4 ≥ x

Since x must be a whole number (you can't miss a fraction of a class), the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine how many customers each person processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges by multiplying the cost of one apple by 5 and the cost of one orange by 5, then adding the two amounts together.

The cost of 5 apples is $1.30 * 5 = $6.50.
The cost of 5 oranges is $1.10 * 5 = $5.50.

The total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = 0.5 * $20,000 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total annual income:
Total annual income = Total monthly income * 12 = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"

"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and there was a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost is:
20 * $30 = $600
10% of $600 is 0.1 * $600 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the two amounts:
$540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first month, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats can be represented as 0.5G. We know that 0.5G = 400.

2. To find the total sales from green hats in the first month, we can solve the equation 0.5G = 400 for G. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get G = 800.

3. Now that we know the total sales from green hats in the first month, we can find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month. Total sales in the first month = 0.5G + G = 800 + 400 = 1200.

4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's denote the total sales in the second month as S2. Then, S2 = (3/4) * 1200.

5. To find the total sales in the second month, we can multiply 1200 by 3/4. S2 = (3/4) * 1200 = 900.

6. To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first and second months. Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900 = 2100.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the cost of each hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the three paid hours: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

First, let's find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. Since her bank account held $200 at the start of the week and she should have received $300, the total amount she should have had is $200 + $300 = $500.

However, her bank account now holds $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the actual amount from the expected amount: $500 - $420 = $80.

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80."
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves each guest will eat. Since each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves. To do this, we divide 48 by 2, which equals 24. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs are needed. To do this, we divide 24 by 12, which equals 2.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane itself is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice as much as the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

Cost of almonds in the first mixture = (1/2 pound) * $10/pound = $5
Cost of walnuts in the first mixture = (1/3 pound) * $15/pound = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts), we need to find the total cost.

Cost of almonds in the second mixture = (1/5 pound) * $10/pound = $2
Cost of walnuts in the second mixture = (1/3 pound) * $15/pound = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as:
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each sheep and goose has one head, we can represent this as:
S + G = 20

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) 4S + 2G = 70
2) S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:
2(S + G) = 2(20)
S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate G:
(4S + 2G) - (S + 2G) = 70 - 40
3S = 30

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
S = 10

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 10."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more, so we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 = 0.2 * $5 = $1
The more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week (7 days). The cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we are given that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means that the good days in the first 30 days are only the first 8 days, as the next 8 days were bad and the last 8 days were neutral.

So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is 8. We are also given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. Therefore, the total number of good days in the month is 8 (from the first 30 days) + 3 (from the next 3 days) = 11.

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month. Since we have already accounted for 30 days, and the next 3 days are given, we need to find the number of good days in the remaining days of the month. The month has 30 days, and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 + 3). Therefore, there are 30 - 33 = -3 days left in the month. However, since we cannot have a negative number of days, this means that the question is asking for the number of good days in the remaining days of the month, not the total number of days left in the month.

Since we have already accounted for 33 days, and the question asks for the number of good days left in the month, we need to find the number of good days in the remaining days of the month. However, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, which means that we have already accounted for 2 of the good days in the remaining days of the month. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 1.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are now 2 * 8 = 16 dogs. Since James already had 12 dogs, he needs 16 - 12 = 4 more toys to bring the total to 16 dogs.
4. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he now has 16 - 3 = 13 dogs.
5. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 13 toys for the 13 dogs.

However, we need to consider the initial 4 toys James had. So, the total number of toys James needs is the 13 toys for the 13 dogs plus the initial 4 toys.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can find out how many cookies Max has in relation to the Cookie Monster. Let's call the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has 'x'. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

We already know that Max has 73 cookies, so we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and Max has 73 cookies. So, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress: the extension by 50% and the addition of 20cm.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. When Shania extends the dress by 50%, the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, making the final length 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. We need to convert 0.5 hours to minutes: 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time it takes to get to the fire station and then subtract that from the total time they have to get to school.

Time taken to get to the library: 6 minutes
Time taken to get to the fire station: 13 minutes
Total time taken so far: 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Since they have 30 minutes to get to school, we subtract the time taken so far from the total time:
30 - 19 = 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1 kilo of apples costs $4.
2 kilos of bananas cost 2 * $2 = $4.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, and then subtract the number of cookies they ate.

Greta bakes 30 cookies. 
Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90.

They eat 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, their combined ages can be expressed as: 2T + t = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can express the age of the older twin as T+7 = t+7.

Now, we can substitute the expression for T+7 into the first equation: 2T + t = 44. 

Since T+7 = t+7, we can rewrite it as T = t. 

Substituting T = t into the first equation, we get 2t + t = 44, which simplifies to 3t = 44.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get t = 44/3, which is approximately 14.67. 

However, since age must be a whole number, we can try to find a combination of ages that satisfies the conditions.

Let's try t = 14. Then, T = 14 and T+7 = 21. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplet are 14 + 14 + 16 = 44.

One of the twins is 14 years old."
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. Since Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost of the lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

Since the cost of the candies is $1.20 for 4 candies, the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins Rong and Neil save each month and then multiply it by the number of months in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so he saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

In 10 years, there are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong's total savings in 10 years = 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.
Neil's total savings in 10 years = 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x. The sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + 0.6x.

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can set up the equation: 0.6x = 0.6($40 + 0.6x). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.6x = 24 + 0.36x. Subtracting 0.36x from both sides, we get 0.24x = 24. Dividing both sides by 0.24, we get x = 100.

So the total bill is $100. 

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought: $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The price of one banana is twice as much as one apple, so it is 2 * $0.5 = $1.
The price of one orange is three times as much as one banana, so it is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in one crate:
- Bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of each type of fruit: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The comforter has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
The comforter has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

The total number of squares is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

The total area of the comforter is 68 * 1 = 68 square feet.

"To find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has, we need to multiply the number of high chairs by 5. 

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Since babies also need chairs, we need to add the number of babies to the number of adults. 

Number of chairs already available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs already available from the total number of chairs needed.

Number of chairs needed = 57
Number of chairs already available = 48
Number of chairs to get = 57 - 48 = 9

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

Total deer = 50
Bucks = 50% of 50 = 0.5 * 50 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20% of the bucks are 8-point, we can calculate this as follows:

8-point bucks = 20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Since Adam has 50 points, 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

2. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

3. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

4. Now, let's add up the points of Adam, Betty, Marta, and Tom: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

5. The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 great-grandchildren.

However, the question asks for the number of great-grandbabies, not great-grandchildren. Since the great-grandchildren are the children of the grandchildren, we need to multiply the number of great-grandchildren by 3 to get the number of great-grandbabies.

So, the total number of great-grandbabies is 27 x 3 = 81.

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount they need to raise per hour is $2100 / 3 = $700.

To find the total number of hours they need to fundraise, we divide the total amount they need to raise ($4200) by the amount they need to raise per hour ($700).

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour, and then calculate the total amount produced in 48 hours.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so its rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so its rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of ice cream produced in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 4 people in this group (Bryce and the two friends), we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(2/3) * (4 * 12) = (2/3) * 48 = 32

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people in this group, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(3/4) * (2 * 12) = (3/4) * 24 = 18

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by all the friends:

32 + 18 = 50

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

72 - 50 = 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The dog takes 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, and the cat takes 30 minutes. 

So, the time the dog takes is 2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time. To do this, we add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes ""x"". Then, we can write the equation:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get:

90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we get:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 5000 people were in line to vote.

By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. To find the number of people who voted by midday, we multiply 5000 by 2/5:
5000 * (2/5) = 2000 people voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is:
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find the number of people who voted by 16:00, we multiply 3000 by 2/3:
3000 * (2/3) = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000 people.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will need for 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. For 30 days, he will need:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

A pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he needs by the number of pieces in a pack:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of s'mores required and then determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed to make that many s'mores.

First, let's calculate the total number of s'mores needed for the kids: 9 kids * 2 s'mores/kid = 18 s'mores.

Next, let's calculate the total number of s'mores needed for the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 s'mores.

Now, we add the number of s'mores needed for the kids and adults: 18 s'mores + 6 s'mores = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed: 24 s'mores / 8 s'mores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed: 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box.

However, since 3 sleeves are needed and there are 3 sleeves in a box, we actually need 1 box and a half."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. 

Substituting D = 15 into the equation, we get F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38.

Now, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4.

Substituting F = 38 into the equation, we get M = 38 - 4 = 34.

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age by adding their ages together: D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"This is a simple problem of division. To find out how much money each of Greg's siblings got, we need to divide the total amount of money ($20) by the number of people (4, including Greg).

The formula for division is: Total amount ÷ Number of people = Amount per person

In this case, the total amount is $20 and the number of people is 4.

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

So, each of Greg's siblings, including Greg, got $5.

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and add them together.

- The math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.
- The French book weighs 4 pounds.
- The English book weighs 3 pounds.
- The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

The final answer is: 17"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many votes candidate B got. Since candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, and candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate candidate B's votes as follows:

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.2 x 100 = 20 votes
Candidate B's votes = 50% more than candidate A's votes = 20 + (50/100 x 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we know that candidate B got 30 votes, and candidate A got 20 votes. To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to subtract the total votes of A and B from the total number of voters:

Total votes of A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes
Total votes = 100
Candidate C's votes = Total votes - Total votes of A and B = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, then Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Boris still has 100 apples. To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 100 - 87 = 13.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water available (32 ounces).

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the total amount of water available:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

2 * Steven's books = 20

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we add 6 to Steven's books:

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now that we know Alice has 16 books and Clara has 20 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's books from Clara's books:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

Gallon jar = Half-gallon jar + $2
$5 = Half-gallon jar + $2
Half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Half-gallon jar = $3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
16 * $3 = $48

Next, we need to find the cost of a 10-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can multiply this by 10:
10 * $5 = $50

Now, we can add the total cost of the half-gallon jars and the 10-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
$48 + $50 = $98

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. The total number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - 10 - 5 = 35.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as 'm' and the number of students who like to play video games as 'v'. We are given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, so m = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of students who like to play video games or music is 35, so m + v = 35. Substituting the value of m, we get 10 + v = 35.

To find the value of v, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: v = 35 - 10 = 25.

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Jeremy saw 12 birds. He threw a stone and scared away 1/3 of that number. 

1/3 of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

So, 4 birds were scared away, leaving 12 - 4 = 8 birds.

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 

Now, the total number of birds in the backyard is 8 (initially fearless birds) + 20 (new birds) = 28.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 0.4x is the number of girls in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of girls is 2 * 0.4x = 0.8x.

We know that the total number of students is 80, so the total number of students in both classes is 2x. Since the total number of students is 80, we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class. Now, we need to find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. We can find the number of boys in each class by multiplying the number of students in each class by 0.6:

Number of boys in each class = 0.6 * 40

"To find the profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he obtained.

The total cost of the packs is 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

The total value of the cards he obtained is $4000 + $1000 + (30 cards * $50 per card) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The total value of the cards is greater than the cost of the packs, so Mark made a profit. The profit is the difference between the total value of the cards and the cost of the packs: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

"To find the number of students per group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

Total students = 54
Number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we are told that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students = 12 * 9
Total students = 108

However, we already know that there are 54 students. Since the total number of students is less than the calculated total, we need to find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students.

New number of groups = Total students / Students per group
New number of groups = 54 / 9
New number of groups = 6

Since the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find the difference between the required number of groups and the new number of groups.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles, we can find out how many the third house needs. We already determined that the third house needs x cases of shingles, which is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total is 3 * $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total is 5 * $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total is $3.

Now, let's add their totals together: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of bananas = 200
Increase in pears = 45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90
Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Now, we know that George has 290 pears and 200 bananas. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of pears and bananas:

Total number of fruits = 290 + 200 = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial amount) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining amount) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 times as many kilograms to make 4 liters of juice. 

5 kilograms/liter * 4 liters = 20 kilograms

Now, we need to find out how much money Sam would have to spend to buy 20 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so we multiply the number of kilograms by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the equation:

Ezra's books = 2 * Ahmed's books
300 = 2 * Ahmed's books

To find Ahmed's books, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Now that we know Ahmed read 150 books, we can find the total number of books they read altogether. Ezra read 300 books and decided to read 150 more, so Ezra's total books will be 300 + 150 = 450. Ahmed read 150 books. Therefore, the total number of books they read altogether is 450 + 150 = 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked is 5 * $15 = $75. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns $5 for Monday. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for the hours worked is 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday is $30.

Now, we add the total earnings for Monday and Wednesday to find the total earnings for the two days: $80 + $30 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Bennet will make from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he will make from selling the eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he will make $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from selling them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time spent on other activities and then subtract that from the total available time.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 hours for soccer and video games.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

So, she spends 3 hours playing video games, leaving 9 - 3 = 6 hours for soccer.

The percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer is (6/12) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph. To find the time it takes to drive to the museum, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total time spent driving is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time spent at the museum (6 hours), the total time Jack is gone from home is: 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 4 * 57 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 2 * 73 = 146.

The total number of wheels needed for both the cars and the motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, the number of wheels left after assembling all the toys is 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate 1/3 of 600, which is 600 / 3 = 200 movies in series.

2. Since Mike can buy the series for $6, we don't need to calculate the cost of individual series movies. The cost of the series movies is $6.

3. Now, we find out how many movies are not in series. We subtract the number of series movies from the total number of movies: 600 - 200 = 400 movies.

4. Next, we find out how many of the remaining movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we calculate 40% of 400, which is 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies.

5. The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

6. The remaining movies are not in series and not older movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies: 400 - 160 = 240 movies.

7. The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost of the normal movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

8. Finally, we add the cost of the series movies, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost: $6 + $800 + $2400 = $3106.

The final answer is: $3106"

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by driving and hiking separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance covered by driving. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance covered by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, let's add the distances covered by driving and hiking to find the total distance to the vacation spot. Total distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference between their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then subtract Emma's score from Ava's score.

Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as E, the number of berries she collects as B, and the time she finishes the level as T. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, the number of enemies Ava jumps on is E + 8. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, the number of berries Ava collects is B + 3. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, the time Ava finishes the level is T + 4.

The score for Emma is 10E + 5B + 30T.

The score for Ava is 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T + 4).

Simplifying the score for Ava, we get 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120.

Combine like terms to get 10E + 5B + 30T + 195.

Now, we can find the difference between their scores by subtracting Emma's score from Ava's score:

(10E + 5B + 30T + 195) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = 195.

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"To find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. 

So, for the two extra days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying fish from the pet store, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17. Since the fish in the pet store tank were a mix of white and orange, we can set up an equation based on the fact that the total number of fish he bought is 17. The equation would be: x + 2x = 17.

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 17.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 17 / 3.

x = 5.67 (approximately), but since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a fish. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of white fish he bought, and we can't have a fraction of a fish, but we can have a decimal."
"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he travels to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, the total distance is:

5 miles (one way) * 2 (to and from) * 5 days = 50 miles

Now, let's calculate the amount of gas he consumes in a week:

50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of gas per week:

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie received and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received:

- 10 twenties = 10 x $20 = $200
- 140 quarters = 140 x $0.25 = $35

Total money received = $200 + $35 = $235

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of the twenties, we multiply $200 by 3/5:

3/5 x $200 = (3 x $200) / 5 = $600 / 5 = $120

Carrie spent $120 from the twenties and $35 from the quarters, for a total of:

$120 + $35 = $155

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 0.25. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 0.125. 

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375. 

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 1 (which represents 100% of the total TVs). 

1 - 0.375 = 0.625. 

Since 0.625 represents 62.5% of the total TVs, we can find the number of OLED TVs by multiplying 0.625 by the total number of TVs sold, which is 40.

0.625 * 40 = 25

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach the minimum temperature of 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night: 
Temperature at night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature at night = 45 - 33
Temperature at night = 12 degrees

Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, and the house needs to be at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing, Carson needs to heat the house by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, so the number of logs needed is:
Number of logs = Total degrees needed / Degrees per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial pay rate is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new pay rate $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final pay rate $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which is $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = (10 * 2) + (10.50 * 18) + (11.50 * 0) = 20 + 189 + 0 = 209 dollars (Billy worked 2 months at $10 per hour, and 10 months at $10.50 per hour, but only 1 month at $11.50 per hour, so we only multiply by 1 month for $11.50 per hour)

However, the 2 months at $10 per hour is 8 weeks, and 10 months at $10.50 per hour is 10 weeks, so the correct calculation is:
Billy's total earnings = (10 * 8 * 20) + (10.50 * 10 * 20) + (11.50 * 2 * 20) = 1600 + 2100 + 460 = 3160 dollars

Sally's total earnings = 10.50 * 20 = 210 dollars

Now, let's find the difference in their earnings:
Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings = 3160 - 210 = 2950 dollars

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 14:

x + 14 = 4.2

Now, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:

x = 4.2 - 14
x = -9.8

However, since we cannot have a negative number of stuffed animals, this solution is not valid. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the equation:

(x + 14) / 14 = 0.3

We can multiply both sides of the equation by 14 to get:

x + 14 = 4.2

However, this equation is not solvable with a positive number of stuffed animals. This is because 30% of 14 is 4.2, which is less than 14. This means that Bubbles already has more than 30% of stuffed animals that are not goats.

To find the number of stuffed goats that will make up 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, we need to find the smallest multiple of 14 that is greater than or equal to 4.2. This is 14 * 1 = 14, but 30% of 14 is 4.2, which is less than 14. The next multiple is 14 * 2 = 28, and 30% of 28 is 8.4, which is still less than 14. The next multiple is 14 * 3 = 42, and 30% of 42 is 12.6, which is still less than 14. The next multiple is 14 * 4 = 56, and 30% of 56 is 16.8, which is still less than 14. The next multiple is 14 * 5 = 70, and 30% of 70 is 21, which is greater than 14.

However, we can also solve this problem by finding the number of stuffed animals Bubbles needs to have in order to have 30% of them be goats. Let's represent the total number of stuffed animals as 'y'. We can set up the equation:

0.3y = x

We are given that the number of stuffed goats is 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

x = 0.3y

We are also given that the number of stuffed puppies, koalas, zebras, and frogs is 14. We can set up the equation:

y = 14 + x

Now we can substitute the expression for x into the second equation:

y = 14 + 0.3y

Now we can subtract 0.3y from both sides of the equation:

0.7y = 14

Now we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.7:

y = 14 / 0.7
y = 20

Now that we know the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles needs to have, we can find the number of stuffed goats:

x = 0.3y
x = 0.3 * 20
x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total hours required: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900. 

30% of $900 is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

The total cost of the ring is the sum of the cost of the diamond and gold, plus the premium: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with the glass chips he has. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, and he has 2 bags of 72 chips each, we first need to find the total number of chips he has.

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can find the total number of square inches Milo can make by dividing the total number of chips by 12.

Total square inches = Total chips / 12 chips per square inch = 144 / 12 = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, and it's a 2D shape, we need to find the length of the mosaic. We can do this by dividing the total square inches by the height of the mosaic.

Length = Total square inches / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (new candies) = 200 candies. 

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell 250 (100 initial + 150 sold), he still needs to sell 250 - 200 = 50 candies.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were lost.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows. 

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21. 

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 2 kids, to find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

The two friends who are worse than Jack can play for half as long, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. Since they can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, they each use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The friend who is better than Jack can play for 1.5 times as long, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. Since they can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, they use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 6 (worse friend 1) + 6 (worse friend 2) + 18 (better friend) = 42 quarters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S, and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = S.

We know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute Z for F in the equation S = 2Z, so S = 2F.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2F. We can substitute S = 2F into the equation O = 2S, so O = 2(2F) = 4F.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F for Z, so O = 4F = 4Z.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it is made up of Z + F + S + S + O. Since F = Z and S = S = 2Z, we can substitute these values into the equation, so the total amount is Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms to get 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10 to get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find F = Z = 1, S = 2Z = 2, and O = 4Z = 4.

"This question seems to be a math problem rather than a philosophical one. However, I can still provide a philosophical perspective on the situation.

From a philosophical standpoint, the question raises questions about the nature of value and the concept of money. For instance, what is the value of a goat or a cow? Is it solely determined by its market price, or are there other factors at play? How do we assign value to these animals, and what implications does this have for our understanding of the world?

However, to answer the question in a more straightforward manner, let's calculate the total amount spent by John.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.
The total amount spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. In total, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars, so he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35. 

So, the number of cars that left is 35. To find the total number of cars he counted during lunch break, we need to subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars after the first break. 

70 - 35 = 35

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has by substituting x = 47 into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors, 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier, and 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00, 1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00, and 10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution: 
$150 (payment) + $80 (mom's contribution) = $230

Since the price of the new laptop is reduced by $200 when she trades in her old laptop, the new price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so we can set up the equation: 
Total money Erika has = Price of the laptop - Amount she still needs
Total money Erika has = $400 - $50
Total money Erika has = $350

Now, we need to subtract the total amount she has from the total amount she received to find out how much she had in her purse initially:
$230 (total received) - $350 (total money she has) = -$120

However, this is not possible since Erika cannot have a negative amount of money. This means that Erika must have had more money in her purse initially to cover the difference.

Let's recalculate the initial amount of money Erika had in her purse:
Initial money Erika had = Total money she has + Amount she received
Initial money Erika had = $350 + $230
Initial money Erika had = $580

The final answer is: $580"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the large and small apples, and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples: 
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples: 
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, let's add the total number of slices from the large and small apples: 
15 slices (large) + 15 slices (small) = 30 slices

Finally, let's subtract the number of slices Adam eats: 
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. Since he extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow and he has 3 cows, the total amount of milk he currently produces is:

5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we subtract the current production from the desired production:

25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we divide the additional amount of milk needed by the amount each cow produces:

10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6: 
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3: 
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2: 
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the unused portions of the glue sticks together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and subtract it from the total cost of the car and the phone.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and $200 from his brother, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the car and the phone is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Craig spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of set theory. Let's denote the set of students good at math as M and the set of students good at English as E.

We know that the total number of students is 20. We also know that 5 students are good at math only (M - E) and 8 students are good at English only (E - M). The rest of the students are good at both math and English (M ∩ E).

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. Then, the total number of students can be represented as:

|M ∪ E| = |M| + |E| - |M ∩ E|

where |M ∪ E| is the total number of students, |M| is the number of students good at math, |E| is the number of students good at English, and |M ∩ E| is the number of students good at both.

We know that |M ∪ E| = 20, |M - E| = 5, and |E - M| = 8. We can rewrite the equation as:

20 = |M| + |E| - x

We also know that |M - E| + |M ∩ E| = |M|, so |M| = 5 + x. Similarly, |E - M| + |M ∩ E| = |E|, so |E| = 8 + x.

Substituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:

20 = (5 + x) + (8 + x) - x

Combine like terms:

20 = 13 + 2x

Subtract 13 from both sides:

7 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

3.5 = x

However, x represents the number of students good at both math and English, not the number of students good at math. To find the number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) to the number of students good at both (x):

|M| = 5 + x
|M| = 5 + 3.5
|M| = 8.5

However, the number of students must be a whole number. This means that the problem statement is inconsistent, as it is not possible for 3.5 students to be good at both math and English."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time required for each group.

The total time available for performances is the total concert time minus the intermission time: 
2 hours (concert time) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 1 hour 50 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 10 minutes per group.

Now, we divide the total available time by the time required for each group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of simple interest. Simple interest is calculated as a percentage of the principal amount, and in this case, the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.

Let's break it down:

Year 1: 
Principal = $300
Interest = 3/4 * $300 = $225
Total = $300 + $225 = $525

Year 2: 
Principal = $525
Interest = 3/4 * $525 = $393.75
Total = $525 + $393.75 = $918.75

Year 3: 
Principal = $918.75
Interest = 3/4 * $918.75 = $687.5625
Total = $918.75 + $687.5625 = $1606.3125

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $1606.31."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars. This means that the remaining white shirts without collars would be 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. Since there are 50 floral shirts in total, the number of floral shirts without buttons would be 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars. This would be 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays:

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many goats were sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, 10 goats were sold. 
From Farm Y, twice as many goats were sold as from Farm X, so 2 * 10 = 20 goats were sold from Farm Y.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm. 

In Farm X, there were originally 55 goats. After selling 10 goats, there are 55 - 10 = 45 goats left.
In Farm Y, there were originally 45 goats. After selling 20 goats, there are 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm: 45 + 25 = 70.

"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's find the number of pairs of shoes James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24):

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

So, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the green food baskets and the red food baskets separately, and then subtract the discount for the red food baskets.

The cost of 3 green food baskets is 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 red food baskets is 3 x $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 x $2 = $6.

The total cost of the red food baskets after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost of all the baskets is $75 + $48 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, we need to calculate one-half of 90 rooms. 

One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we need to multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and double it. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. You are three years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of all your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. 

From point 1, your brother's age is x + 3.

From point 2, your sister's age is x - 2.

From point 3, your mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

From point 4, the sum of all your ages is x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87.

Combine like terms: 4x + 10 + 3x + 8 = 87.

Combine like terms again: 7x + 18 = 87.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 7x = 69.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 9.86 (round down to 9 since age cannot be a decimal).

So, you are 9 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of glue sticks needed and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack, rounding up to the nearest whole number since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs.

First, we find the total number of glue sticks needed: 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number: 7 packs.

"This problem can be solved using exponential growth, which is a concept often discussed in the context of population growth, disease spread, and other exponential processes. 

Let's break it down:

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so the total number of people infected becomes 10 + (10 * 6) = 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 70 people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of people infected becomes 70 + (70 * 6) = 70 + 420 = 490.

Day 3: 
- The 490 people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of people infected becomes 490 + (490 * 6) = 490 + 2940 = 3430.

Therefore, after three days, there are 3430 people infected.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can use substitution to solve for F. 

From equation 2, we can express S in terms of A: S = A + 25.

Substituting this into equation 1, we get: (A + 25) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms: 2A + F + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides: 2A + F = 60

Now, we can express A in terms of F using equation 3: A = F - 12.

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get: 2(F - 12) + F = 60

Distribute the 2: 2F - 24 + F = 60

Combine like terms: 3F - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water. 

Let's start by finding the cost of one bottle of soda. Since 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can divide $21.00 by 7 to get the cost of one bottle of soda.

Cost of one bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00

Now, let's find the cost of one bottle of water. Since 4 bottles of water cost $8, we can divide $8 by 4 to get the cost of one bottle of water.

Cost of one bottle of water = $8 / 4 = $2.00

Now that we know the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

Total cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
Total cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling these chickens will be:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he wants to make a profit of $2000. This means that the total cost of the chickens he sold must be $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Therefore, the total cost of the 180 chickens he took to the market for sale is $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we need to find the difference between the number of glasses Julie sold and the number of glasses Micah sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

1. The cost of the hair service is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair service, which is (1/4) * $400 = $100.
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is (3/4) * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope:

Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * $2
Total amount of money = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length)
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope:

Amount of money left over = Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope
Amount of money left over = $40 - $30
Amount of money left over = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Melanie's current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age plus 'x', which is 8 + x. According to the problem, this age will be thrice her current age, so we can set up the equation:

8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart and then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, each pack of chicken costs $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert has a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x. 

The total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the runtime of the main concert and the encore, which is 2x + 15. We are given that this total runtime is 65 minutes.

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes. 

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initially, Argo had 200 toys.

He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many microphones were not arranged in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, we can calculate the number of microphones that couldn't fit as 20% of 50.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

Since the singer started with 50 microphones, the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40 microphones.

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, we need to divide the number of arranged microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20 pairs

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds in the bushes.

Then, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so 2/3rd of the number of birds flying overhead is 4. This means there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is 6 / 2 = 3 dollars.

Ellen pays a total of 11 dollars for her daily goods. She buys 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. So, the total cost can be represented as:

2c + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants:
2c + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides:
2c = 2

Divide both sides by 2:
c = 1

The price of one carrot is 1 dollar.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is 3x + x + 5x = 9x. 

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We are given that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6x.

We are also given that she mowed a total of 9x lawns. Since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, the total number of lawns she mowed is 9x. 

However, we are not given the total number of lawns she mowed, but we are given the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn, which is $6. We can use this information to find the value of 'x'. 

Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get x = 1.

Now that we know the value of 'x', we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales. 

The amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6x. Substituting the value of 'x' into this equation, we get $80 - $6(1) = $80 - $6 = $74.

The final answer is: $74"

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total earnings from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total earnings per month are 30 * $25 = $750.

However, he has a car payment of $500. To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that after buying 5 more, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies left after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan is dividing the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 / 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference between Denise's and Daniel's total pages read is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup will be used for dinner and then calculate how many bowls of soup will be left over. 

For dinner, there are 3 adults and 2 children, so a total of 5 people. Since each person eats one bowl, 5 bowls will be used for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since 5 people are eating, and 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 5 people, we can assume that the pot can fill 5 bowls for dinner. 

Now, let's calculate the number of bowls of soup left over. The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and 5 bowls will be used for dinner. So, 8 - 5 = 3 bowls of soup will be left over.

Since there are 2 children, and 3 bowls of soup will be left over, each child will be able to have 3 / 2 = 1.5 bowls of soup for lunch. However, since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, we can round down to 1 bowl per child for lunch, and the remaining 1 bowl will be left over.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8 = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had. 

They bought a cake for $11. 
They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3. 
They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so that's 2 * $7 = $14. 

The total amount spent is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28. 

Since they had the same amount of allowance, let's call it x. They combined their allowance, so together they had 2x. 

Since they spent $28, we can set up the equation 2x = 28. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 28 / 2 = 14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

Now, let's add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. The number of students playing soccer is 16 boys + 22 girls = 38.

So, the total number of students is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, and there are 30 students. 

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * 0.8
Total revenue = 240

Next, let's find the total cost. The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each.

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * 0.5
Total cost = 150

Now, let's find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = 240 - 150
Total profit = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has:
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The final answer is: 47"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of bread Abby and Josh can eat together in a day. Since Josh eats twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 (Abby's slices) + 4 (Josh's slices) = 6 slices a day.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices (24) by the number of slices they eat in a day (6).

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the total number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and has been collecting for 5 years, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply 5 years by 12 months per year:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Lana has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row will have an equal number of cups. To find the number of cups in each row, we divide the total number of cups by the number of rows: 27 / 3 = 9 cups per row.

2. Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be the same as the number of chamomile tea cups in each row. Let's call this number 'x'. Since there are 9 cups in each row, the total number of mint tea cups will be 2x (since there are 2 types of tea in each row).

3. We know that the remaining cups after dividing them into rows are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since there are 27 cups in total and 27 - 9 - 9 - 9 = 0 cups left over (as all 27 cups are used), the remaining cups for cinnamon tea are actually part of the initial 27 cups.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip. 

Let's break down the problem: 

- The sloth has 8 hours to collect 24 berries.
- Each trip down, up, and back takes 4 hours, so the sloth can make 8/4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.
- Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, let's call the number of berries picked per trip 'x'.
- The total number of berries picked in 2 trips is 2x.
- We want to find the minimum value of 'x' such that 2x = 24.

To find the minimum value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x = 24
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank and then calculate how much water is used over 6 days.

First, Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since there are 10000 gallons in the pool, half of that is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, over 6 days, 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons of water will be used.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday with the remaining money.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"

On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6"
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between the two distances.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 5 hours = 300 miles

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 miles/hour x 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance traveled by the bus and the car:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's denote John's age as x. Then Paul's age is x + 10.

From point 3, we know that Peter's age is (x + 10) + x = 2x.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100, so we can write the equation: 2x + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100.

However, we don't have any information about Jean's age. But we can still express Peter's age in terms of x. 

Since we are looking for Peter's age, we can express it as 2x.

To find the value of x, we need more information about Jean's age. But since we are not given any information about Jean's age, we cannot find a numerical value for Peter's age using the given information.

However, we can express Peter's age as 2x."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table and subtract the number of tables they already have.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables needed in total
30 tables needed - 15 tables already owned = 15 tables needed.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

Option 1: 24-hour stay - 1600 pesos
Option 2: 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) + additional hours

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the 1000 pesos, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Total cost for Option 2: 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

Now, let's find the difference between the two options:
Difference = Option 1 - Option 2
= 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos
= 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we know each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 7 pounds. 

The total amount of hay needed for the goats is 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.
The total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is 75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate John's total earnings for the week: 
   John's hourly wage is 50 dollars, and he worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount John has after spending 50 dollars on gas:
   John's total earnings are 300 dollars, and he spent 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

3. Calculate the total amount John has after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each:
   Each pencil costs 10 dollars, and John bought 5 pencils, so the total cost of the pencils is 10 * 5 = 50 dollars. John had 250 dollars left, so after buying the pencils, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars.

4. Calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
   John has 200 dollars left, and each pen costs 25 dollars, so the number of pens he can buy is 200 / 25 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled and the total number of letters in the words his brother spelled, then add them together.

Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters in the words he spelled is 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so the total number of letters in the words his brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has initially, the total number of bottles she gives to the students, and then subtract the latter from the former.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice she has initially is 9 * 100 = 900.

Each of the 29 students gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the discounted price of the CDs is $150 - $60 = $90.

James decides to sell 5 CDs for $40 each. 
The total amount he gets from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

However, he spent $90 on the CDs, and he got $200 from selling 5 of them. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he got from the amount he spent. 

But first, we need to find out how much he spent on the 5 CDs he sold. 
The price of 5 CDs is 5 * $15 = $75.

Since he sold the 5 CDs for $200, he actually made a profit of $200 - $75 = $125 from selling the 5 CDs.

Now, to find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the profit from the amount he spent on all the CDs. 
The amount he was out is $90 - $125 = -$35. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. James spent $90 on the 10 CDs and got $200 from selling 5 of them. He still has 5 CDs left, and he didn't mention what he did with them. 

If we assume he kept the 5 CDs, then the amount he was out is $90 - $200 = -$110. However, this is still a negative number, which doesn't make sense.

Let's assume he sold the remaining 5 CDs at the same price, $40 each. 
The total amount he got from selling the remaining 5 CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

Now, the total amount he got from selling all the CDs is $200 + $200 = $400.

The amount he was out is $90 - $400 = -$310. However, this is still a negative number, which doesn't make sense.

Let's re-evaluate the situation again. James spent $90 on the 10 CDs and got $200 from selling 5 of them. He still has 5 CDs left, and he didn't mention what he did with them. 

If we assume he sold the remaining 5 CDs at the same price, $40 each, and he also sold the first 5 CDs at the same price, then the total amount he got from selling all the CDs is 10 * $40 = $400.

The amount he was out is $90 - $400 = -$310. However, this is still a negative number, which doesn't make sense.

Let's re-evaluate the situation again. James spent $90 on the 10 CDs and got $200 from selling 5 of them. He still has 5 CDs left, and he didn't mention what he did with them. 

If we assume he sold the remaining 5 CDs at the same price, $40 each, and he also sold the first 5 CDs at the same price, then the total amount he got from selling all the CDs is 10 * $40 = $400.

However, this is not possible since he only got $200 from selling the first 5 CDs.

Let's re-evaluate the situation again. James spent $90 on the 10 CDs and got $200 from selling 5 of them. He still has 5 CDs left, and he didn't mention what he did with them. 

If we assume he sold the remaining 5 CDs at a different price, then the total amount he got from selling all the CDs is $200 + x, where x is the amount he got from selling the remaining 5 CDs.

The amount he was out is $90 - ($200 + x). 

Since he sold the first 5 CDs for $40 each, the price of the remaining 5 CDs must be less than $40 each, otherwise, he would have gotten more than $200 from selling the first 5 CDs.

Let's assume the price of the remaining 5 CDs is $y each. 

The total amount he got from selling the remaining 5 CDs is 5 * $y = $5y.

The amount he was out is $90 - ($200 + $5y).

Since he sold the first 5 CDs for $40 each, the price of the remaining 5 CDs must be less than $40 each. 

Let's try to find the maximum possible value of y. 

The total amount he got from selling the first 5 CDs is $200. 

The total amount he got from selling all the CDs is $200 + $5y.

The amount he was out is $90 - ($200 + $5y).

Since he spent $90 on the 10 CDs, the amount he was out must be greater than or equal to $0.

$90 - ($200 + $5y) ≥ 0

$90 ≥ $200 + $5y

-$110 ≥ $5y

-$22 ≥ $y

y ≤ $22

So, the price of the remaining 5 CDs must be less than or equal to $22 each.

The total amount he got from selling the remaining 5 CDs is $5y.

The amount he was out is $90 - ($200 + $5y).

Since he spent $90 on the 10 CDs, the amount he was out must be greater than or equal to $0.

$90 - ($200 + $5y) ≥ 0

$90 ≥ $200 + $5y

-$110 ≥ $5y

-$22 ≥ $y

y ≤ $22

Since the price of the remaining 5 CDs must be less than or equal to $22 each, let's try to find the minimum possible value of y.

The minimum possible value of y is $0.

The total amount he got from selling the remaining 5 CDs is $5y = $5 * $0 = $0.

The amount he was out is $90 - ($200 + $5y) = $90 - ($200 + $0) = $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, this is still a negative number, which doesn't make sense.

Let's try to find the maximum possible value of y.

The maximum possible value of y is $22.

However, this is still a negative number, which doesn't make sense.

Let's try to find the value of y that makes the amount he was out equal to $0.

The amount he was out is $90 - ($200 + $5y) = $0.

$90 - ($200 + $5y) = $0

$90 = $200 + $5y

-$110 = $5y

-$22 = $y

So, the price of the remaining 5 CDs is $22 each.

The total amount he got from selling the remaining 5 CDs is $5y = $5 * $22 = $110.

The total amount he got from selling all the CDs is $200 + $110 = $310.

The amount he was out is $90 - $310 = -$220.

However, this is still a negative number, which doesn't make sense.

Let's try to find the value of y that makes the amount he was out equal to a positive number.

The amount he was out is $90 - ($200 + $5y) = $x.

$90 - ($200 + $5y) = $x

$90 = $200 + $5y + $x

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance. 
   Distance = 20 miles, 
   Speed = 2 miles per hour, 
   Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours.
   60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
   Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

2. Since he rested for half as long as the swimming time, he rested for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

3. The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.
   He swims at half the speed, so his new speed is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
   Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles = 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

4. Total time taken = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time taken to rest + Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles
   Total time taken = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has in terms of the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as S. We are given that S = 70.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. This can be written as 7S - 40.

Now, we substitute the value of S into the equation: 7(70) - 40.

First, we multiply 7 and 70: 7 * 70 = 490.

Then, we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 = x - 10 points.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x - 10) + (x + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x = 45.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored x - 10 = 15 - 10 = 5 points.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes. 

To convert this to minutes, we multiply 7 hours by 60 minutes per hour and add 55 minutes: 7 * 60 + 55 = 445 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed that day is 445 - 23 = 422 minutes.

The final answer is: 422"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 x 12 = 24 measuring cups. 

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he has (2/3) x 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, which is 24 + 10 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds occupied initially.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

Number of patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients.

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Initially, there were 100 occupied beds, and 700 more patients were admitted.

Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 100 + 700 = 800 beds.

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200 beds.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, she sends 6 emails to her family.

The remaining non-work emails (after sending to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. One-third of these emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Shawna's age, and then use that to find her father's age.

Since Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age, since her father is five times as old as Shawna:

Father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Father's age = 5 * 9
Father's age = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's assume the number reported by Courtney is 100%. 

20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the relationship between the number of balls each boy carried. 

Let's say Jeffrey carried x balls. 
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. 
Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2(2x) = 4x balls.

We know that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation 2x = 2 to find the value of x. 
Solving for x, we get x = 1. 

Now that we know Jeffrey carried 1 ball, we can find the number of balls Jason and Jordan carried. 
Jason carried 2x = 2(1) = 2 balls. 
Jordan carried 4x = 4(1) = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as x.

At the end of the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

At the end of the second day, they dug 13 more holes, making it 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

At the end of the third day, they dug 8 more holes, but then filled in 2, making it 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the end of the fourth day.

We know that by the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day: 40 - 29 = 11.

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips each person got. We can write an equation:

Total corn chips = Amora's corn chips + Lainey's corn chips + Collins' corn chips
Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to first determine the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400. 

Since the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We are given the following information:

1. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan: L = S + 5
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13
3. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + L = 339

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation: A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms: A + 2S + 5 = 339

We can substitute the second equation into the above equation: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339
Expand the equation: A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339
Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360

Divide by 9: A = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of episodes and then multiply it by the length of each episode.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e'. According to the problem, there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can set up the equation:

e = 20 / 2
e = 10

So, there are 10 episodes in total.

Now, we need to find the total time John will spend watching the show. We can do this by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = e * 20
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is the sum of the first and third distances:

Total southerly distance = 300 miles + 110 miles
Total southerly distance = 410 miles

The distance traveled in the northerly direction is 36 miles. To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we subtract the northerly distance from the total southerly distance:

Distance between homes = Total southerly distance - Northerly distance
Distance between homes = 410 miles - 36 miles
Distance between homes = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten
= 66 - 18

"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years) + his brother (16 years) + his sister (6 years) = 30 years.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Zeke's players = Carlton's players + 7
Zeke's players = 13 + 7
Zeke's players = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Zeke's team and Carlton's team:

Total players = Zeke's players + Carlton's players
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden and then multiply it by 2, since Robert needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

2. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

3. Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

4. She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. To find 1/4 of 160, we multiply 160 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4. So, 160 / 4 = 40 oranges.

5. Since she kept 40 oranges, she sold the rest, which is 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries, Jerry must have the remaining cherries:

Total cherries = Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries + Jerry's cherries
60 = 30 + 20 + Jerry's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, A = 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for both days.

The total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday is 10 * $6 = $60.
The total earnings from apple pie on Saturday is 11 * $15 = $165.
The total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday is 15 * $6 = $90.
The total earnings from apple pie on Sunday is 15 * $15 = $225.

"To determine the total number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use and divide it by the amount of sunscreen in each bottle.

Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so she will be outside for a total of 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil is 19 now, when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. Therefore, his brother will be 5 / 2 = 2.5 years old when Emil turns 24.

Now, let's find the current age of Emil's brother. Since his brother will be 2.5 years old when Emil turns 24, his current age is 24 - 2.5 = 21.5 years old.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old when Emil turns 24.

To find the current age of Emil's dad, we subtract 5 years from 48, since Emil will be 5 years older when he turns 24. So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of Emil's brother (21.5) and his dad (43). To find the sum of their ages, we add them together: 21.5 + 43 = 64.5.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed and then calculate the total cost.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, let's calculate the total space needed for each plant, including the space between them. The width of each plant is 12 inches, and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space needed for each plant is:

12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space between plants) = 30 inches

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, we need to calculate how many more plants she needs to buy. Let's assume she needs to buy x more plants. The total number of plants will be 17 (the ones she already owns) + x (the ones she buys).

The total length of the flower bed is 1332 inches, and each plant takes up 30 inches of space. So, the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed. She already owns 17, so she needs to buy:

44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be:

27 plants * $6/plant = $162

The final answer is: $162"

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25 (since 25% is equivalent to 0.25).

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 to find the yearly savings.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we divide the yearly savings by the cost of each pair.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 * 10 = 30 minutes.

However, since these tasks are not done sequentially, but simultaneously, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp. Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

2. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

3. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

4. The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 degrees (from low) + 12 degrees (from high) = 18 degrees.

5. However, the room also warmed up for 2 hours without the air conditioner, so it warmed up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

6. The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 degrees (cooling) - 4 degrees (warming) = 14 degrees.

7. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how old Bill's father was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet as 'x'. Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time would be 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years, so we can set up the equation:

x + 75 = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

75 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 37.5

This is the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet. Since Bill was 30 years old when his father saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his father was 37.5 years old by subtracting 37.5 from 30.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Since the time between the two sightings is 75 years, and Bill's father saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 from 30.

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 30 - 75 = -45

However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that Bill's father saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

Now, we need to find Bill's age when his father was 37.5 years old. Since the time between the two sightings is 75 years, we can set up the equation:

Bill's age when his father was 37.5 years old = Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time - 75

However, we already know that Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 112.5. So, we can set up the equation:

Bill's age when his father was 37.5 years old = 112.5 - 75

Bill's age when his father was 37.5 years old = 37.5

Now, we can find Bill's age when he was born by subtracting 37.5 from 37.5.

Bill's age when he was born = 37.5 - 37.5 = 0

However, this is not possible since age cannot be zero. This means that the initial assumption that Bill's father saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old is incorrect.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights per day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11 flights.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings:

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of guests at the wedding by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, we need to find 1/2 of 1500 cookies.

1/2 of 1500 cookies = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church next door, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of people in the church next door = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. 

Let's denote the size of a kid's slice as x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of an adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is 6 (2 adults + 4 kids). 

The total size of the slices for the kids is 4x (4 kids * x). 
The total size of the slices for the adults is 4 * 2x = 8x (2 adults * 2x).

The total size of the watermelon is 100 units, so we can set up the equation: 4x + 8x = 100.

Combine like terms: 12x = 100.

Divide both sides by 12: x = 100 / 12 = 8.33 (approximately).

Now that we know the size of a kid's slice, we can find the size of an adult's slice: 2x = 2 * 8.33 = 16.67 (approximately).

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the size of an adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100: (16.67 / 100) * 100 = 16.67%.

The final answer is: 16.67"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Converting 300 minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Total hours worked: 9 hours

Time left to update records: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes for the cake to cool (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time it takes for the cake to cool and frost (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we need to add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake. 

5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 8:00 am."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. So, we can set up the equation:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

Daily earnings = (rental cost + (number of students * cost per student)) * number of days rented per week
= ($25 + (10 * $1.50)) * 3
= ($25 + $15) * 3
= $40 * 3
= $120 per week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the monthly earnings would be:
Monthly earnings = daily earnings * 4
= $120 * 4
= $480

However, this is an approximation, as a month can have 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. To get a more accurate answer, we would need to know the exact number of days in the month.

Assuming a 4-week month with 28 days, the monthly earnings would be:
Monthly earnings = daily earnings * 28
= $120 * 28
= $3360

But, if we consider a 4-week month with 31 days, the monthly earnings would be:
Monthly earnings = daily earnings * 31
= $120 * 31
= $3720

To provide a more accurate answer, we would need to know the exact number of days in the month. However, based on the information given, we can assume a 4-week month with 28 days for a more conservative estimate.

The final answer is: $3360"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

For Peter, the total number of chocolate bars is 4x, and we know this equals 64. So, we can write the equation: 4x = 64.

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 64 / 4 = 16.

This means Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

For Martha, the total number of chocolate bars is 7x, and we know this equals 56. So, we can write the equation: 7x = 56.

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 7: x = 56 / 7 = 8.

This means Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of female porcupines in the park. 

Given that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * Total population
= (3/5) * 50
= 30

Next, we need to find the total number of babies born in a year. Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Total babies born in a year = Number of female porcupines * 4 * 12
= 30 * 4 * 12
= 1440

Now, we need to add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

Total porcupines after a year = Initial population + Total babies born in a year
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

The final answer is: $826"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first, and then add them to the number of red sticks.

We know that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Total students: 3000
2. Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.
4. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old.
5. One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.
6. Total male students: 375 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1125 male students.
7. Total female students: Total students - Total male students = 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as 'x'. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% charge remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last hour. 

Let's denote the charge lost in the last hour as 'y'. So, we can set up the equation: 34% - y = 28%.

To find 'y', we can rearrange the equation: y = 34% - 28% = 6%.

Since the power bank loses 7% of its capacity in the last hour, we can set up another equation: 7% * 1 = 6%.

However, this equation is not correct because it implies that the power bank loses 6% of its capacity in 1 hour, which contradicts the given information. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. The power bank loses 7% of its capacity in the last hour, but the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. This means that the power bank loses 34% - 28% = 6% in the last hour, but this 6% is 7% of the charge remaining after 7 hours, not the initial charge.

Let's denote the charge remaining after 7 hours as 'z'. So, we can set up the equation: 7% * z = 6%.

To find 'z', we can rearrange the equation: z = 6% / 7% = 0.8571 (approximately).

Now, we can find the charge remaining after 7 hours: 55% - (9% * 5) = 55% - 45% = 10% + 45% = 55% (this is the charge remaining after 5 hours), but we need to find the charge remaining after 7 hours, so we need to subtract 9% * 2 = 18% from 55% to get 37%.

However, we know that the charge remaining after 7 hours is 0.8571 * 100% = 85.71% is incorrect, we need to find the charge remaining after 7 hours, so we need to subtract 9% * 2 = 18% from 55% to get 37%, but we need to add 7% * 3 = 21% to get 58%, but we need to find the charge remaining after 7 hours, so we need to subtract 9% * 5 = 45% from 100% to get 55%, then add 7% * 3 = 21% to get 76%, but we need to find the charge remaining after 7 hours, so we need to subtract 9% * 2 = 18% from 76% to get 58%.

Now, we can find the charge remaining after 7 hours: 58%.

Now, we can find the charge remaining after 8 hours: 58% - 7% = 51%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 51% charge remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last hour. 

Let's denote the charge lost in the last hour as 'y'. So, we can set up the equation: 51% - y = 28%.

To find 'y', we can rearrange the equation: y = 51% - 28% = 23%.

Since the power bank loses 7% of its capacity in the last hour, we can set up another equation: 7% * 1 = 7%.

However, this equation is not correct because it implies that the power bank loses 7% of its capacity in 1 hour, which contradicts the given information. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. The power bank loses 7% of its capacity in the last hour, but the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. This means that the power bank loses 51% - 28% = 23% in the last hour, but this 23% is 7% of the charge remaining after 7 hours, not the initial charge.

Let's denote the charge remaining after 7 hours as 'z'. So, we can set up the equation: 7% * z = 23%.

To find 'z', we can rearrange the equation: z = 23% / 7% = 3.2857 (approximately).

Now, we can find the charge remaining after 7 hours: 58% - 7% * 3 = 58% - 21% = 37%.

However, we know that the charge remaining after 7 hours is 3.2857 * 100% = 328.57% is incorrect, we need to find the charge remaining after 7 hours, so we need to subtract 9% * 5 = 45% from 100% to get 55%, then add 7% * 3 = 21% to get 76%, then subtract 7% * 3 = 21% to get 55%, then subtract 9% * 2 = 18% to get 37%.

Now, we can find the charge remaining after 7 hours: 37%.

Now, we can find the charge remaining after 8 hours: 37% - 7% = 30%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 30% charge remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last hour. 

Let's denote the charge lost in the last hour as 'y'. So, we can set up the equation: 30% - y = 28%.

To find 'y', we can rearrange the equation: y = 30% - 28% = 2%.

Since the power bank loses 7% of its capacity in the last hour, we can set up another equation: 7% * 1 = 7%.

However, this equation is not correct because it implies that the power bank loses 7% of its capacity in 1 hour, which contradicts the given information. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. The power bank loses 7% of its capacity in the last hour, but the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. This means that the power bank loses 30% - 28% = 2% in the last hour, but this 2% is 7% of the charge remaining after 7 hours, not the initial charge.

Let's denote the charge remaining after 7 hours as 'z'. So, we can set up the equation: 7% * z = 2%.

To find 'z', we can rearrange the equation: z = 2% / 7% = 0.2857 (approximately).

Now, we can find the charge remaining after 7 hours: 37% - 9% * 2 = 37% - 18% = 19%.

However, we know that the charge remaining after 7 hours is 0.2857 * 100% = 28.57% is incorrect, we need to find the charge remaining after 7 hours, so we need to subtract 9% * 5 = 45% from 100% to

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

Therefore, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jamaar has spent so far and subtract that from his total budget to find out how much he has left to spend on plums.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost so far: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar's remaining budget: $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums he can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we first need to determine how many packs of sweets Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since there are 10 friends, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10):

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend

However, since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack:

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Since the number of pictures per album is 9, we can multiply this by the number of albums for each category to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums
Selfies = 9 * 3
Selfies = 27

Portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums
Portraits = 9 * 2
Portraits = 18

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set: 6 * 10 = 60.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. So, the number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.
5. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions. 

40% of the 60 questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24. 
The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. 
Divide the remaining questions by 2 to find the number of average and difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get right. 
Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18. 
Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9. 

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, add the number of easy and average/difficult questions she is sure to get: 18 + 9 = 27.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.
2. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.
3. We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.
4. The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.
5. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can substitute this into the equation from step 4: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.
7. To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.
8. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can find the value of x by substituting y = 6 into this equation: x = 2(6) = 12.

"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week and then add them together.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Suzanne earned from selling cookies and cupcakes, and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from selling cookies:
80 cookies * $1 each = $80

Next, let's calculate the total amount earned from selling cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount she gave away is:
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings:
$320 - $20 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Total eggs = 100
Eggs found by the Smith twins = 30 * 2 = 60
Remaining unfound eggs = 10

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

For the first package, the price is $3 and the number of sandwiches is 2. 
For the second package, the price is $6 and the number of sandwiches is 4.

We can set up a proportion to find the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

Price per sandwich for the first package = $3 / 2 = $1.5
Price per sandwich for the second package = $6 / 4 = $1.5

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can find the price for the third package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches:

Price for the third package = Price per sandwich * Number of sandwiches
= $1.5 * 8
= $12

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate how much he still owes after selling his old bedroom set. 

He buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the amount he still owes is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

1. 40% of the red balloons burst: 
   Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:
   Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
   Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

3. 75% of the blue balloons were added:
   Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
   Total number of balloons now = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34

Therefore, Sally carried 34 balloons into the school.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the third scenario is dependent on the second scenario not happening, so we need to multiply the probabilities. The probability that the normal teacher doesn't give an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%. 

Now, we can find the probability of the third scenario: 60% * 20% = 12%. 

The total probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is the sum of the first two scenarios and the third scenario: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. 

The correct approach is to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, which is 100% - (50% + 40% + 12%) = 100% - 102% = -2%. However, this is also not possible since the total probability must be 100%. 

The correct approach is to find the probability that the normal teacher gives an extension, and then subtract that from 100%. The probability that the normal teacher gives an extension is 40%. 

However, we also need to consider the scenario where the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment. The probability of this scenario is 60% * 20% = 12%. 

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - (40% + 12%) = 48%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to first determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates.

Available seats for guests: 4750

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. 

Let's denote the number of small beans as S, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of large beans as L. We are given the following information:

1. It takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so M = 2L.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, so S = 3M.

From the first point, we know L = 75. 

From the second point, we know M = 2L = 2 * 75 = 150.

From the third point, we know S = 3M = 3 * 150 = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans. 

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we need to subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings. 

Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = 45 - 9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total. Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so her total hours worked are 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Now, we can calculate her hourly wage by dividing her net earnings by the total hours worked.

Hourly wage = Net earnings / Total hours worked
Hourly wage = 36 / 18
Hourly wage = $2

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first find out how many soda bottles he can place along the driveway. 

Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to place each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds/bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total number of apples Uncle Franky has, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in school. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost while in school is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

2. Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to calculate 3/8ths of 21 days. To do this, we multiply 21 by 3/8.

   21 * (3/8) = (21 * 3) / 8
   = 63 / 8
   = 7.875

   So, the painters worked a total of 7.875 days.

3. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we need to multiply 7.875 days by 24 hours to get the total hours worked.

   7.875 * 24 = 189 hours

4. Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter.

   189 / 4 = 47.25

So, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010. 

The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that 21% of the car's value is lost each year.

In 2008, the car's value will be 79% of its original value (100% - 21% = 79%). 
In 2009, the car's value will be 79% of the value in 2008 (79% * 79% = 62.41%).
In 2010, the car's value will be 79% of the value in 2009 (79% * 62.41% = 49.22%).

To find the price of the car in 2010, we multiply the original price by the percentage of the value remaining after 3 years of depreciation.

Price in 2010 = $20000 * 0.7921 * 0.6241 * 0.4922
Price in 2010 = $20000 * 0.2453
Price in 2010 = $4906

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

However, since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash, we need to calculate how many times he needs to wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set. We can do this by dividing 5 by 3 (2 twin sets + 1 king set), which is 1 with a remainder of 2. This means he needs to wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set once, and then wash the remaining 2 twin sets.

So, in a week, he does 2 loads of laundry.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 2 * 52 = 104 loads of laundry in a year.

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes), so it is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills, so it is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours, so it is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add up the costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

John's scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80. 

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The average score is 95."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club, we multiply 20 by 0.7 (which is 70% expressed as a decimal).

20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team: 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: 245"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 
   So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, the number of sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3.

4. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. 
   So, the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 + 3 = 6.

5. The total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. 

The number of trucks that delivered the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

The total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

First, let's calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter at the regular price: 6 pounds * $4.00 per pound = $24.00.

Since the promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can consider it as a 50% discount on the second pound of butter. 

For the first pound, the cost is $4.00. For the second pound, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

For the third pound, the cost is $4.00. For the fourth pound, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

This pattern continues for the remaining pounds. 

So, the total cost is: $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 and then multiply that by the cost per additional guest. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 people. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are already included in the rental fee, we need to find the number of additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost per additional guest is $6, so the total cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

Adding the initial rental fee of $125, the total cost of the party is $125 + $126 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can work backwards to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie had as M and the initial amount of money Riza had as R. We know that after spending a quarter of their money, Maggie had $60, so we can set up the equation:

M - (1/4)M = 60

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(3/4)M = 60

Multiplying both sides by 4/3, we get:

M = 80

So Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, since Riza spent one-third of her money and had $60 left, we can set up the equation:

R - (1/3)R = 60

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(2/3)R = 60

Multiplying both sides by 3/2, we get:

R = 90

So Riza initially had $90.

Now that we know the initial amounts, we can find the total amount of money they had initially:

M + R = 80 + 90 = 170

Since they spent a portion of their money, we need to find the total amount they spent. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is (1/4) * 80 = 20. Riza spent one-third of her money, which is (1/3) * 90 = 30.

The total amount they spent is 20 + 30 = 50.

To find the amount of money they have left, we subtract the total amount they spent from the initial amount:

170 - 50 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day.

We know that the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315, and this is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas the monkeys eat in a week is 315.

We can set up the equation: 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x = 315

Combine like terms: 56 + 7x = 315

Subtract 56 from both sides: 7x = 259

Divide both sides by 7: x = 37

So, the third monkey eats 37 bananas each day. 

37"
"To find the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract that from the total to find the number of pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then determine how much change Jenny will receive.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Jenny bought 15 roses, but since a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of the remaining roses as follows:

15 roses - 12 roses (1 dozen) = 3 roses
Cost of 3 roses = 3 x $2 = $6
Cost of 1 dozen roses = $15
Total cost of 15 roses = $6 + $15 = $21

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, which is a total of:
5 x $5 = $25

Now, let's calculate the change Jenny will receive:
Change = $25 (payment) - $21 (cost) = $4

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change to quarters:
$4 = 16 quarters (since 4 x $1 = $4 and 1 dollar = 4 quarters)

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes. Since he is currently at the station, we need to find out how long he has been waiting. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, and the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes. So, Paul has been waiting for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more she needs to save to reach 200.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since the sculpture requires 200 toothpicks, and Melanie already has 120, she needs to save:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we can divide the number of toothpicks she needs to save by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price he paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

(2000 - 1800) / 2000 * 100 = 10%

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to determine how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. Since there are 4 hours, there are 3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds in 4 hours.

2. Next, we need to determine how many jellyfish each spring creates in 4 hours. Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, and there are 14400 seconds in 4 hours, each spring will create 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours.

3. Now, we need to determine how many jellyfish 5 springs will create in 4 hours. Since each spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, 5 springs will create 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles and his speed is 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

However, this is only the time it took him to walk to the store. He then walked back home, which is the same distance, so the time it took him to walk back home is also 1 hour.

Since he walked to the store and back, we need to add the two times together:

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

If Jenny bought the bananas individually, the cost would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Since Jenny bought the bananas in bunches, the cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, let's first define the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's break down the information:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

1. Time spent in classes:
   - John takes 2 extra classes per day, each 40 minutes long.
   - So, he spends 2 * 40 = 80 minutes per day in classes.
   - Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 80 * 5 = 400 minutes per week in classes.

2. Time spent on Saturday and Sunday:
   - John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so there are 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes in a week.
   - 1/16 of 1680 minutes is (1/16) * 1680 = 105 minutes.

3. Total time spent learning:
   - Time spent in classes: 400 minutes
   - Time spent on Saturday and Sunday: 105 minutes
   - Total time spent learning: 400 + 105 = 505 minutes

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

Let's start with the 270 kilograms of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. Since the Allosaurus ate the last of the meat, the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. 

Let's call the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Then, the velociraptors ate half of x, which means they ate x/2. 

Since the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, we know that x/2 + 270 = x. 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x/2 + 2*270 = 2x. This simplifies to x + 540 = 2x.

Now, we can subtract x from both sides to get 540 = x.

However, this is the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate. We need to find the original amount of meat on the triceratops. Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is half of the original amount. 

Let's call the original amount of meat ""y"". Then, we know that y/2 = 540. 

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: y = 2*540 = 1080.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost per gallon is $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of the friend picking a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas. The probability of Ellen's friend picking a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. 20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10. So, he takes 10 days off.

The number of days he helps is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, the total number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

The total number of people he helps is 40 * 6 = 240.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who attended the ceremony. 

First, let's calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses. Since each bus carried 35 people and there were 12 buses, the total number of people transported by buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, let's calculate the total number of people who were transported by the private cars. Since each car carried 3 people and there were 20 cars, the total number of people transported by cars is 20 * 3 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of people transported by buses and cars to find the total number of people who attended the ceremony. 420 + 60 = 480.

However, this is the total number of people who were transported, not the total number of people inside the church. Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people who were transported from the total number of people who attended the ceremony. But, we don't have the total number of people who attended the ceremony. 

However, we can infer that the number of people inside the church is equal to the total number of people who attended the ceremony minus the number of people who were transported. But, we don't have the total number of people who attended the ceremony.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 
time difference = 5 - 3 = 2 minutes

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total time spent on lunches and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Now, we multiply the time spent per day by 5 to find the total time spent in 5 days.
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

The total time spent on lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah's distance, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the combined distances of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Towels: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00
6. New balance: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement. 40% of her current annual salary is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses will be 20 * $40,000 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate how much she needs to save each year. Since she saves 20% of her salary, she saves 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

However, this is not enough to cover her expenses. We need to calculate how many years she needs to work to save at least $800,000.

Let's divide the total amount she needs to save ($800,000) by the amount she saves each year ($20,000). 

$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save enough money. Since she already has a retirement period of 20 years, we need to subtract this from the total number of years.

40 - 20 = 20 years.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the length of each of the 4 equal parts that Marty will cut the ribbon into. 

Since Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he must cut it into 4 equal parts, we divide 100 by 4 to get the length of each part:

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Now, each of these 4 parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the total number of students that 40% represents. Since 40% of the students are boys and that equals 240, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the discount.

Discount: $7
Total cost after discount: $45 - $7 = $38

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The three women wearing 4-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The three women wearing 2-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"

"This question appears to be a math problem rather than a philosophical one. However, I can still provide a step-by-step solution.

To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he initially had, and then add the amount he saved.

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
3. He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
4. He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

The final answer is: $7"

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

The total time they all took to do their chores is 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip and multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 2 hours (given)
Speed = 70 mph (given)

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total distance = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we need to multiply the total distance by 2:
Total distance per month = 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we need to divide the total distance Sofie will walk by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers:

200 toys (from the first 4 workers) + 20 toys (from the fifth worker) = 220 toys (from the first 4 workers) + 160 toys (from the fifth worker) = 380 toys

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour:

160 toys / 10 hours = 16 toys/hour

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so Elijah's first dog weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. 

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so Elijah's second dog weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. 

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add Elijah's dogs to Kory's dog: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. This means Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving any to Kris.

Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis had 23 stickers and gave half of them to Kris. Half of 23 is 11.5, but since you can't give half a sticker, we'll assume that Luis had an even number of stickers to begin with. Let's call this number x. Then, Luis gave x/2 stickers to Kris and kept x/2 stickers.

We know that Luis gave 11 stickers to Kris (since Kris had 16 stickers and 7 came from Rob). This means that x/2 = 11. To find x, we multiply both sides by 2, so x = 22.

Now we know that Luis had 22 stickers. We also know that Luis got half of Seth's stickers. This means Seth had 22 * 2 = 44 stickers to begin with.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, we find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's. 

To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 km every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 km by dividing 20,000 km by 400 km/day.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we are given that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

The final answer is: 750"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 years old now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since Vince's age two years ago was 7, we need to add 2 to find his current age: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

From point 1, we know A = M.

From point 2, we know C + S = 30.

From point 3, we know C = S + 12.

We can substitute C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30 to get:
S + 12 + S = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, and A + M + C + S = 56, we can substitute the values of C and S:
A + M + 21 + 9 = 56
Combine like terms:
A + M + 30 = 56
Subtract 30 from both sides:
A + M = 26

Since A = M, we can substitute A for M:
A + A = 26
Combine like terms:
2A = 26
Divide both sides by 2:
A = 13

Now that we know A = 13 and C = 21, we can find the difference between C and A:
C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 200 crayons, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply that by the price of each plank.

First, John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree. 80% of 80 is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet. 

Since he cuts the tree into 4-foot logs, he can make 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so he can make 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.2, so he makes 80 * $1.2 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, we can multiply Valerie's salary by 2 to find her brother's salary.

Valerie's salary: $5000
Brother's salary: 2 * $5000 = $10,000

Now, we know that their mother earns twice their combined salary. So, we need to add Valerie's and her brother's salaries first, and then multiply the result by 2 to find their mother's salary.

Combined salary of Valerie and her brother: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000
Mother's salary: 2 * $15,000 = $30,000

Now, we need to add the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and her mother to find the total amount of money they all have together.

Total amount of money: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach, which is 2 miles. So, we can set up the equation:

2 miles = 40 minutes * x miles/minute

To find x, we can divide both sides by 40:

x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles/minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

Speed on sidewalk = 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute

Now, we need to find the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute)
Time = 10 minutes

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, and 2 miles on the beach, the total time spent on the sidewalk and beach is:

Time on sidewalk = 10 minutes
Time on beach = 40 minutes
Total time on beach and sidewalk = 10 + 40 = 50 minutes

However, this is not the total time for the entire 3-mile walk. We also need to consider the time it takes for her to walk the remaining 1 mile on the sidewalk. Since we already know her speed on the sidewalk is 1/10 miles/minute, we can find the time it takes to walk the remaining 1 mile:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute)
Time = 10 minutes

The total time for the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and sidewalk, and the time spent on the remaining 1 mile of sidewalk:

Total time = 50 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 60 minutes

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is:

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:

$60 (target) - $32 (already saved) = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:

$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of marbles Bob initially has as 'x'.

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. So, the equation becomes: x + 24 = 60.

To find the initial number of marbles Bob has, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 60 - 24.

x = 36

Now that we know Bob initially has 36 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 of them. To do this, we subtract 10 from 36: 36 - 10 = 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle that would allow Donny to drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug.

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, the total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since Donny can now drink the water, the average temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they will bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Initially, there were 50 cows, so after three weeks, there will be 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they will bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Initially, there were 20 chickens, so after three weeks, there will be 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700.

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

A 10% discount on $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00. 

So, the discounted cost of 4 packs of bagels is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make one scoop of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write this as:

Potatoes per scoop = (6 - 3) / (3 - 1)
Potatoes per scoop = 3 / 2
Potatoes per scoop = 1.5

Now that we know how many potatoes it takes to make one scoop, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Potatoes eaten = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Potatoes eaten = 18 * 1.5
Potatoes eaten = 27

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens.

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

Let's denote the number of red jellybeans as R and the number of green jellybeans as G. We know that R = 2G. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, R = 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can set up an equation to represent this: G + R + B = 60, where B is the number of blue jellybeans. We already know that G = 17 and R = 34. 

Substituting these values into the equation, we get 17 + 34 + B = 60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. 

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can find the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower.

Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers / Cost of each sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet costs $8, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet.

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets / Cost of each bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in each bouquet is 12. Therefore, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is 7 * 12 = 84.

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold.

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold individually + Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold
= 13 + 84
= 97

Finally, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3.

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * 3
= 97 * 3
= 291

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks Adam buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells each rock for $7, the total revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks is:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he didn't sell. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 rocks * $5/rock = $40

The total cost of the rocks Adam bought is $100, but he only sold $84 worth of rocks. He still has $40 worth of unsold rocks. Therefore, the total cost of the rocks is $100 + $40 = $140.

The difference between the total cost and the revenue is:

$140 - $84 = $56

Adam loses $56.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Then, Carlos collected 2x seashells.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can write an equation:

27 = 2x + 5

To solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides:

22 = 2x

Now, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells. Carlos collected twice as many, which is 2x = 22 seashells. Jim collected 27 seashells.

Now, let's find out how many seashells each person got when they divided them equally. The total number of seashells is 11 + 22 + 27 = 60. 

To divide them equally, we divide 60 by 3:

60 / 3 = 20

So, each person got 20 seashells.

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 2 devices, the total profit from Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 4 devices, the total profit from Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of the cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Carla has 8 identical octuplets. 
2. 3/4 of them wear purple, which is 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies.
3. 1/4 of them wear blue, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies.
4. All 2 babies wearing blue also wear bows.
5. 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. This includes the 2 babies wearing blue and the 2 babies wearing purple and bows. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 + 2 = 4.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100. 

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received during the week.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, let's subtract this result from the total number of reports received during the week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday:
Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received during the week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
= 5168 - 4043

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.
4. He then sold 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.
6. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 * $3 = $90.
7. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $90 from the third sale. So, the total amount of money he earned is $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 face masks per day * 2 days = 12 face masks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Lamar finds 5 eggs.
2. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
3. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
4. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
5. Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.
6. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert this to a numerical value: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
7. To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total amount of money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total number of collections.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
200 + 200 = 400

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640

Now, we add the total number of apartments in all three complexes:
400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:
1040 * 3 = 3120

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
3120 * 0.40 = $1248

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year and then sum them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as X. So, in the 8th year, it produces X - 200 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount in the 10th year, and a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits in the 10th year, and a 7-year-old tree produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits. The difference between the production of a 10-year-old and a 7-year-old tree is 1000 - 350 = 650 fruits. This is the production of a 10-year-old tree in the 7th year. Since the production of a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year is 200 fruits less than in the 7th year, the production of a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year is 650 - 200 = 450 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years: 
50 + 150 + 350 + (450 - 200) + 0 + 1000 = 50 + 150 + 350 + 250 + 0 + 1000 = 1600.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of money Sophia gave to Jack and then add it to the initial amount Jack had.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5:
$100 * (1/5) = $20

Now, we add the amount Sophia gave to Jack to the initial amount Jack had:
$100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - y = 12x/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

15x - 5y = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides, we get:

3x - 5y = 0

Now, we need to find the amount of money Ronnie has left. We know that Ronnie gave y dollars to their little sister, so Ronnie is left with x - y dollars.

We can express y in terms of x from the equation 3x - 5y = 0:

3x - 5y = 0
-5y = -3x
y = 3x/5

Now, substitute y = 3x/5 into the expression for Ronnie's remaining money:

Ronnie's remaining money = x - y
= x - 3x/5
= (5x - 3x)/5
= 2x/5

We are given that Ronnie was initially given $5, so x = 5. Substitute x = 5 into the expression for Ronnie's remaining money:

Ronnie's remaining money = 2x/5
= 2(5)/5
= 10/5
= 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as R, W, and P respectively. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say R = W = P.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is painted with red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6).

Since the other half is painted with red, white, and purple, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can say that R + W + P = 6.

We also know that R = W = P, so we can substitute W and P with R in the equation: R + R + R = 6.

Combine like terms: 3R = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: R = 2.

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost of the box and then divide the result by the cost per cycle ($1).

Number of cycles per dollar = Number of pods / Cost of the box
= 120 / 12
= 10

Now, we need to divide the result by the cost per cycle ($1) to find the number of cycles we can run for $1.

Number of cycles for $1 = Number of cycles per dollar / Cost per cycle

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has $1200, he needs 1200 / 5 = 240 5 dollar bills.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scores 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals. Team B scores 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches. 

Initially, the teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches. 

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Now, the teacher goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to get smaller than 2 inches.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. After 'x' days, the chalk will be 20% of 2.75 inches.

2.75 * (0.2)^x < 2

We can solve this inequality by trial and error or by using logarithms. 

Let's try different values of 'x':

- After 1 day: 2.75 * 0.2 = 0.55 inches (not smaller than 2 inches)
- After 2 days: 2.75 * (0.2)^2 = 0.11 inches (not smaller than 2 inches)
- After 3 days: 2.75 * (0.2)^3 = 0.022 inches (smaller than 2 inches)

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C.

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since Kate has 6 friends, the total number of slices needed is 10 * 6 = 60.

The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find the number of pizzas needed, we need to divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas (to have enough slices) and 8 pepperoni pizzas (to have enough slices).

The total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is 6 + 8 = 14.

Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each of them ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices they ate is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages added. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides:

x = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost of the haircut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April and she works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, we can calculate her total hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours worked = 180 hours

Now, let's calculate her earnings from her hourly rate:

Earnings from hourly rate = Total hours worked * Hourly rate
Earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Earnings from hourly rate = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences for the entire month, she will receive the attendance bonus of $10 for each day she worked. Since she worked 6 days a week for 4 weeks, she worked a total of:

Total days worked = 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total days worked = 24 days

However, since she receives the attendance bonus for each day, we should multiply the total days worked by the bonus amount:

Attendance bonus = Total days worked * Bonus amount
Attendance bonus = 24 days * $10/day
Attendance bonus = $240

Now, let's add her earnings from her hourly rate and her attendance bonus to find her total earnings:

Total earnings = Earnings from hourly rate + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"
"To find the total amount Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each task and then add them up.

- Cleaning the room: $1.50 (done once) = $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 (done twice) = $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 (done 6 times) = $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, let's add up the total earnings: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to find the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. 
3. After that, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

50 (morning) + 40 (at 10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (by evening) = 320

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens separately and then add them together.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since she bought 25 red pens, she bought 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of the red pens and the black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. Since John buys 10 bottles for $600, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to get the cost per bottle.

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $60

2. Now, let's find the number of bottles of cognac John buys. It's given that he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch
= 2 * 10
= 20

3. The cost of cognac is 50% more than the cost of scotch. To find the cost per bottle of cognac, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of scotch and add it to the cost of scotch.

Cost of scotch per bottle = $60
50% of the cost of scotch = 0.5 * $60
= $30
Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost of scotch per bottle + 50% of the cost of scotch
= $60 + $30
= $90

4. Now, let's find the total cost of cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles.

Total cost of cognac = Cost per bottle of cognac * Number of bottles of cognac
= $90 * 20
= $1800

5. Finally, let's find the total amount John spends on everything by adding the total cost of scotch and the total cost of cognac.

Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
= $600 + $1800
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days. The total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 30 = 50. The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 50 = 90.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140.

"To find the amount of root beer available for each person at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents and then divide it by the number of people.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. So, the amount available for each person is 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, the remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes, which is 5/11 of the remaining fish. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. This is the sum of the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes. 

Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42.

"Let's break down the information given:

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

In total, Amy lost 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy has 26 - 7 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. After running it for 3 days, the total water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters of water per day. After running it for 3 days, the total water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters of water per day. After running it for 5 days, the total water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total water removed by each setting: 3 (low) + 6 (medium) + 20 (high) = 29 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. 

First, let's find the total interest he owes. The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the total interest plus the initial amount borrowed, minus the total amount paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the remaining amount is 6 (interest) + 300 (initial amount) - 275 (total paid in 11 months) = $31.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height of the jar is 15 inches, so the volume is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, the actual volume of the jar that can be filled with jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know his guess. Since we don't know his guess, we can calculate the percentage difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Let's assume his guess is x. The percentage difference is ((x - 900) / 900) * 100.

To find the actual difference, we need to find the value of x that would give us the same percentage difference as the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans. 

The difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans is 864 - 900 = -36. 

The percentage difference is (-36 / 900) * 100 = -4%.

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation: ((x - 900) / 900) * 100 = -4.

Solving for x, we get x = 900 - (900 * 0.04) = 900 - 36 = 864.

However, this is the number of red jelly beans, not the total number of jelly beans. To find the total number of jelly beans, we can divide the number of red jelly beans by 0.3 (since 30% of the jelly beans are red). 

The total number of jelly beans is 864 / 0.3 = 2880.

However, we already know that the total number of jelly beans is 2880. This means that Tim's guess was 0 jelly beans off, since 2880 is the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Pauline's visits before and after the price increase.

Initially, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. In 5 years, she will visit 3 * 5 = 15 times. The cost of one visit is $2, so the total cost for the first 5 years is 15 * 2 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 5 dollars.

For the next 3 years, Pauline will visit the museum 3 * 3 = 9 times. The total cost for these visits is 9 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: 30 + 45 = $75.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be denoted as 4x.

We know that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the original length of the board, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying 8 by 4:

4x = 4 * 8 = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. 

The original price of the manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40. The total price for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since there's a 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $75. 20% is the same as 0.20, so 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the total price: $75 - $15 = $60. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each costs $3. So, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

1. The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.
2. The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.
3. The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues, we need to find the total number of magazines. 

We know that the first 3 magazines send 12 issues each, the second magazine sends 6 issues, and the third magazine sends 24 issues. To find the total number of magazines, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let x be the number of magazines that send 12 issues each, y be the number of magazines that send 6 issues each, and z be the number of magazines that send 24 issues each.

We know that x = 3, y = 1, and z = 1 (since there is only one magazine that sends 6 and 24 issues).

The total number of magazines is x + y + z = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total. 

So, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given steps:

1. The price of the toy in November is $40.
2. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).
   New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72.
3. In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).
   New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the reduced-rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the reduced-rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. The reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total amount from reduced-rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the amounts from the standard lessons and the reduced-rate lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pomelos Eve had left after giving some away. Since she was left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can calculate this as follows:

Original amount: 20 pomelos
1/4 of the original amount: 20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos

So, Eve had 5 pomelos left. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to subtract the number of pomelos she had left from the original amount:

Number of pomelos given away = Original amount - Number of pomelos left
= 20 - 5
= 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them. 
   First, we need to find out how many apples he ate: 
   2/5 * 60 = 24 apples.
   So, he ate 24 apples and had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

2. Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining number of apples. 
   25% of 36 is 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples.
   So, he gave his sister 9 apples and had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

3. Finally, he sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. 
   The number of apples he sold is 27, and the price per apple is $3. 
   So, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is: $81"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of novels Regina wrote this year is x. We know that 9 is 3 quarters of x, so we can write the equation as:

9 = (3/4)x

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days and then find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that he has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days:

Distance = Speed x Time
Time = 3 days = 3 x 24 hours = 72 hours
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, let's find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:

Percentage = (Distance traveled / Total distance) x 100
= (3600 km / 6000 km) x 100
= 0.6 x 100

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is the total number of grapes remaining divided by 12.
5. Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. The number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used their share is x - 36.
6. Since their mother used the remaining grapes to make pies, the number of pies she can make is (x - 36) / 12.
7. We are told that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, so (x - 36) / 12 = 4.
8. To find the initial number of grapes, we can solve the equation (x - 36) / 12 = 4 for x.
9. Multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to get x - 36 = 48.
10. Add 36 to both sides of the equation to get x = 84.

"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

Number of teachers who were sick: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Total number of teachers at school that day = 13 + 9 = 22

However, we also need to consider the number of teachers who were not sick. Since there were 82 teachers in total, we subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers.

Number of teachers who were not sick = 82 - 13 = 69

Now, we add the number of teachers who were not sick and the number of substitute teachers to find the total number of teachers at school that day.

Total number of teachers at school that day = 69 + 9 = 78

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. 

First, we need to find the total number of minutes the custodian has to clean the classrooms. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they have 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day. 

Since they have 5 days, the total number of minutes they have to clean the classrooms is 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find the total number of minutes it takes to clean all the classrooms. Since it takes them 15 minutes per classroom, and there are 80 classrooms, the total number of minutes is 15 * 80 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms. To do this, we divide the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of minutes they have to clean, and then multiply by 100. 

(1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelves can hold as 'x'. Since there are two middle shelves, the total number of books they can hold is 2x.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2x books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

The total number of books the bookcase can hold is the sum of the books on all shelves: 2x + 2x + 2x - 5 = 6x - 5.

We know that Elly has 110 books, and we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. Let's denote the number of bookcases as 'n'. Then, the total number of books the bookcases can hold is n(6x - 5).

Since the total number of books is 110, we can set up the equation: n(6x - 5) = 110.

We also know that the middle shelves can hold 10 books each, so x = 10.

Now we can substitute x = 10 into the equation: n(6(10) - 5) = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get: n(60 - 5) = 110, n(55) = 110.

Dividing both sides by 55, we get: n = 2.

However, this is the number of bookcases needed to hold the books on one shelf configuration. Since the problem asks for the total number of bookcases, we need to consider the number of bookcases needed for each shelf configuration.

The bottom shelf can hold 2x = 2(10) = 20 books, the top shelf can hold 2x - 5 = 10 - 5 = 5 books, and the middle shelves can hold 2x = 2(10) = 20 books. 

The total number of books on one shelf configuration is 20 + 5 + 20 = 45 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find the minimum number of shelf configurations needed to hold all the books. 

110 / 45 = 2.44 (round up to 3, since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase).

However, we already know that one bookcase can hold 45 books, and 2 bookcases can hold 2(45) = 90 books. 

So, we need 3 bookcases to hold 90 books, and we still have 110 - 90 = 20 books left.

We can put the remaining 20 books on the middle shelves of the 3rd bookcase, which can hold 2(10) = 20 books.

Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so the selling price per egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33.

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is 60 * $0.33 = $20.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide that by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since the price is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents to match the units of the number of sticks. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so the discounted price in cents is $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we can divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly in total to pass 6th grade. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we need to find the total number of questions first.

Let's assume the total number of questions is x. Then, 70% of x is the number of questions she needs to answer correctly. We can set up the equation:

0.7x = total questions she needs to answer correctly

However, we don't know the total number of questions yet. We know that the first test has 70 questions and the second test has 40 questions. So, the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110.

Now, we can set up the equation:

0.7x = 0.7 * 110
0.7x = 77

Now, we need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. We know that she got 60% of 70 questions correct. 

60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42

So, she got 42 questions right on the first test. Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test to pass 6th grade.

Total questions she needs to answer correctly = 77
Questions she got right on the first test = 42

Questions she needs to get right on the second test = 77 - 42
Questions she needs to get right on the second test = 35

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation: s + b = 116.

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation: b = 5s - 4.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation: b = 5(20) - 4.

Calculate the number of blueberry cubes: b = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

For the rooms, half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms in total, half of them is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and then add the cost of the main phone to it.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40

Now, we add up the number of people Conor saw each day: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 1.5 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

The final answer is: 210"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

First, we know that Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party. Then, he also needs to make an extra gallon for Allen, which is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means the extra gallon will have the same amount of lemon juice as 2 regular gallons. 

So, in total, Tim needs to make 4 (regular gallons) + 2 (extra gallons) = 6 gallons of lemonade.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 6 gallons. 

6 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 6 cups of lemon juice

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed to get 6 cups of juice. 

6 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 6 * 6 = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of the dogs and then multiply it by 7.

The Kennel house has 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. 

The daily consumption of the German Shepherds is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.
The daily consumption of the Bulldogs is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For the 2-legged animals, each animal has 2 legs. Since there are 10 2-legged animals, the total number of legs from these animals is 10 * 2 = 20.

For the 4-legged animals, each animal has 4 legs. Since there are 15 4-legged animals, the total number of legs from these animals is 15 * 4 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals to get the total number of animal legs on the farm: 20 + 60 = 80.

However, the question asks for the number of pairs of animal legs. Since each pair consists of 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs: 80 / 2 = 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of yellow blocks. We are told that there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. Since there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we know that the total number of blocks is 32, and we have 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks. To find the number of red blocks, we need to subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - (Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks)
= 32 - (4 + 8)
= 32 - 12
= 20

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in the west direction and the total distance he traveled in the east direction. 

First, we calculate the distance traveled in the west direction: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Then, we calculate the distance traveled in the east direction: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours
Distance = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 
Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net distance = 54 miles

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies.

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. The number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since there are 232 candies in total, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can calculate the number of marbles he received by adding the marbles he dropped back to the marbles he has now.

Marbles Dallas received = Marbles Dallas has now + Marbles Dallas dropped
Marbles Dallas received = 21 + 4
Marbles Dallas received = 25

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and we now know that Dallas received 25 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Darla received by subtracting the marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles given.

Marbles Darla received = Total marbles given - Marbles Dallas received
Marbles Darla received = 52 - 25
Marbles Darla received = 27

"To determine the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add the individual weights together.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600.

Force required = 1% * 1600
Force required = 0.01 * 1600
Force required = 16 pounds

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
2. He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
3. The total number of items Igor had is 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 16 Petri dishes = 31 items.
4. However, the total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, which means he lost 31 - 29 = 2 items.
5. Since Igor had the correct number of beakers, the 2 items he lost must be beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we can multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we need to add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total number of eggs.

Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in the first basket + Number of eggs in the second basket
Total number of eggs = 10 + 20
Total number of eggs = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa. Let's assume Aaron's speed is A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed is V miles per minute.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can write the equation: A = 2V.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since Aaron's speed is A, we can write the equation: 16 = 4/A.

We can solve for A by rearranging the equation: A = 4/16 = 1/4 miles per minute.

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed using the equation A = 2V: 1/4 = 2V.

We can solve for V by dividing both sides by 2: V = (1/4)/2 = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race by dividing the distance by her speed: time = distance/speed = 4/(1/8) = 4 * 8 = 32 minutes.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the dock and subtract the amount the caretaker already has.

The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line in total.

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he has from the total amount required: 600 - 6 = 594.

The final answer is: 594"
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue calculation:
- Number of reservations per night: 6
- Meals per reservation: 2
- Cost of each meal: $5
- Total cost of meals per reservation: 2 * $5 = $10
- Cost of wine per reservation: $5
- Total cost per reservation: $10 + $5 = $15
- Total daily revenue: 6 reservations * $15 = $90

Weekly revenue calculation:
- Number of days open per week: 2
- Total weekly revenue: $90 * 2 = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The total cost is given as $80. 

Since the vendor bought 50 watermelons, we can find the cost of each watermelon by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons:

Cost per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon. The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to add 25% of the cost price to the cost price:

Selling price = Cost price + (Profit percentage * Cost price)
Selling price = $1.60 + (0.25 * $1.60)
Selling price = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. James is now twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is currently 2 * 12 = 24 years old.

2. Since James is 24 years old now, and he was born when John was 19, we can calculate John's current age by adding 24 to 19, which gives us 43.

3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means that the youngest son is currently 43 - 32 = 11 years old.

4. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then compare their rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we subtract Jane's total from Ana's total: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.2:

$400 * 0.2 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so we multiply $50 by 3:

$50 * 3 = $150

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost:

$80 + $150 = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
