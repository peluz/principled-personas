"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = 1.5x

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 1.5x

Divide both sides by 1.5: 
x = 86,667

So the total value of the house after the repairs is $86,667. 

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = 86,667 - 80,000 = 6,667

The final answer is: $6,667"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he does in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total number of meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James does this 3 times a week, the total number of meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. 

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed per meal. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

We can express the cost of the remaining glasses as a geometric series: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + ... + $x, where x is the cost of the 16th glass. 

The common ratio (r) of the geometric series is 0.6. 
The number of terms (n) is 15 (since we already counted the first glass). 
The first term (a) is $5. 

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get: 
S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6)

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Carla downloads 40% of the file in the first part of the download. 
   40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB.

2. The time taken to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

3. After 40 minutes, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.

4. Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the entire 200 GB.

5. The time taken to download the entire 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

6. The total time taken is the sum of the time taken in the first part, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download.
   Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

1. First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is traveled in this segment.

3. Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, we add up the distances traveled in each segment to find the total distance from home:
Total Distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

The final answer is: 315"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, and then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours to get her total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads for each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

Let's calculate the total cost and revenue for each year:

Year 1:
- Initial cost: $90
- Annual expenses: $3
- Annual revenue: $10.5
- Total cost: $90 + $3 = $93
- Net loss: $93 - $10.5 = -$82.5

Year 2:
- Initial cost: $90 (already paid)
- Annual expenses: $3
- Annual revenue: $10.5
- Total cost: $90 + $3 = $93
- Net loss: $93 - $10.5 = -$82.5

Year 3:
- Initial cost: $90 (already paid)
- Annual expenses: $3
- Annual revenue: $10.5
- Total cost: $90 + $3 = $93
- Net loss: $93 - $10.5 = -$82.5

We can see that the net loss is the same for the first three years. This is because the initial cost of $90 is not yet recovered.

Year 4:
- Initial cost: $90 (already paid)
- Annual expenses: $3
- Annual revenue: $10.5
- Total cost: $90 + $3 = $93
- Net loss: $93 - $10.5 = -$82.5

However, we need to consider that the initial cost of $90 is now fully covered by the revenue from the first 3 years of lemons, so we only need to consider the annual expenses and revenue for year 4.

Year 4:
- Annual expenses: $3

Since the net gain in year 4 is positive, it means that Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree in the 4th year.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. 
   Let's assume she started with x vacuum cleaners. Then, she sold x/3 at the green house.

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. 
   So, the remaining vacuum cleaners after the green house sale are x - x/3 = 2x/3.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. 
   The remaining vacuum cleaners after the red house sale are 2x/3 - 2. 
   She sold half of this at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

4. After the orange house sale, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. 
   The remaining vacuum cleaners after the orange house sale are 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = 5.
   Simplifying the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5
   Combining like terms: x/3 - 1 = 5
   Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6
   Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(8 / 20) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item that will increase in value the most. 

First, calculate the increase in value for each item:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, the distance covered by each train is the same, which is 80 miles.

On the second day, they travel northward, covering 150 miles. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, the distance covered by each train is the same, which is 150 miles.

Therefore, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances covered on each day, which is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual salary from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual salary from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

To find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of eggs she eats in a week by 4: 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time Marissa has taken to walk the first 6 miles. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so the total time taken for the first 6 miles is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, and she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, her average speed for the entire trail is 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the time she needs to take to walk the remaining 6 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. Time = Distance / Speed = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.

Since she has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, the time she needs to take to walk the remaining 6 miles is 1.5 hours. However, the question asks for the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, not the time.

To find the speed, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. The distance is 6 miles, and the time is 1.5 hours. Speed = 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.

However, this is the average speed she needs to maintain for the remaining distance, not the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the non-water portion of the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

When we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, we spill 1/3 of the water from the orange drink, which is (1/3) * 6.67 = 2.22 liters.

So, the remaining water from the orange drink is 6.67 - 2.22 = 4.45 liters.

Now, we add the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 4.45 + 9 = 13.45 liters.

The total volume of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 13.45 liters of water. To find the remaining non-water portion, we subtract 13.45 from 24: 24 - 13.45 = 10.55 liters.

However, the question asks for the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. So, the answer is the amount of water we calculated earlier, which is 13.45 liters.

The final answer is: 13.45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born and then subtract that from the current age of Samantha.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old now. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:

Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age - 6
Raymond's current age = 31 - 6
Raymond's current age = 25

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. So, when his son was born, Raymond was 23 years old. Now, we need to find out how many years ago this event occurred.

To do this, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

Years ago = Raymond's current age - Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth
Years ago = 25 - 23
Years ago = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers separately and then add them together.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples.

Cost of chicken meal: $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Now, we need to find the number of boxes of pizza. Each box costs $8.50, so we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of one box to find the number of boxes.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, we add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so the total number of cartons she buys is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total amount she spends is 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
= 60 - 20
= 40 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop to the second stop
= 40 - 25
= 15 miles

However, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is actually 25 miles. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop to the second stop
= 60 - 25

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We are given that the cost of the less expensive pair of heels is $33. We are also given that the cost of the more expensive pair of heels is twice as much as the less expensive pair, so H = 2 * 33 = 66.

We are told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. This can be expressed as an equation: B = H + 33 + 66 - 5. 

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 66 + 33 + 66 - 5. 

Combining like terms, we get B = 160.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age now is 162, we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
= 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess: 80 / 2 = 40, then 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent per dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time per week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to find the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of 1 yogurt, we divide $5.00 by 4: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of 1 yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

Let's denote the number of Lego sets John sold as 'x'. Since he sold each set for $15, the total amount of money he made is 15x.

We know that he used this money to buy 8 video games for $20 each. So, the total amount of money he spent on video games is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is equal to the amount he spent on video games plus the amount he had left: 15x = 160 + 5.

Now, we can solve for x: 
15x = 165
x = 165 / 15
x = 11

This means John sold 11 Lego sets. Since he originally had 13 Lego sets, the number of Lego sets he still has is 13 - 11 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total time he spends running in a week and then divide the total distance by that time.

First, let's find the total time John spends running in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days.

Total time spent running in a week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total time spent running in a week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total time spent running in a week = 6 hours

Now, we can find John's running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Running speed = Total distance / Total time
Running speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Running speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can calculate her running speed as follows:

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends a total of 6 hours, we can calculate the time she spends running and walking as follows:

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours
Time spent running = 2 hours

Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours
Time spent walking = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking:

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To find the total number of pieces of pie that were taken by the guests, we need to first find the total number of pieces of pie that were available. 

Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

Since there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the total number of pieces minus the remaining pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can have by the total weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 300g = 240g

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
So, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Total number of articles written in the three days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours spent writing articles = 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee, she had 80 - 220 = -140 Post-it notes left. However, we know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. This means that the package she purchased had 23 + 140 = 163 Post-it notes.

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find the total time Tom spends traveling, we need to calculate the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spends traveling back.

First, let's find the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. However, we don't know the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM. We know that he travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a 3-hour period. 

So, the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM is 10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, let's find the time he spends traveling back. We know the distance is 30 miles and his speed is 6 miles per hour. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

Friday: 
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $0
- Revenue from car tires: 12 car tires * $40/car tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

Since the revenue on Thursday ($520) is higher than the revenue on Friday ($480), we need to find the difference between the two revenues.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then find 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the 5% increase after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she gets the standard $50,000/year pension. For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

First, let's calculate the total amount she would have earned in 20 years at the standard rate:

20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000

Now, let's calculate the value of the pension after 20 years. Since she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal (initial) amount, r is the annual interest rate (5% in this case), and n is the number of years.

However, in this case, we are looking for the value of the pension after 10 years of the 5% increase, not the total amount after 30 years. We can use the same formula to find the value of the pension after 10 years of the 5% increase:

A = $1,000,000(1 + 0.05)^10

A ≈ $1,628,929.92

Now, let's calculate 5% of this value:

5% of $1,628,929.92 ≈ $81,144.65

So, for the last 10 years, Marcy's pension will be $81,144.65/year. To find her total annual pension, we add this to the standard pension for the first 20 years:

$50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000
$81,144.65/year * 10 years = $811,446.50
Total pension = $1,000,000 + $811,446.50 = $1,811,446.50

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the average of the two pensions. The first 20 years she gets $50,000/year and the last 10 years she gets $81,144.65/year. 

Average pension = ($50,000 + $81,144.65) / 2
Average pension = $65,572.325

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14.

The amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

The amount paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This includes the initial amount she had plus the amount she received from her allowance. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To find the initial amount Bailey had, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 classes * 5 days = 25 classes. 
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 
So, the total number of classes she teaches in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 classes * 15 students = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 students * $15/student = $7,425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions.
The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

"To find the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then divide it by the number of months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each cell phone is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for all 5 cell phones is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, the monthly payment will be $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total amount Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then add them together.

The total revenue from petunias is 9 pots * $2 per pot = $18.
The total revenue from begonias is 17 pots * $2 per pot = $34.

The total amount Artie will make is $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level below it has half the square footage, the second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage, the third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage, and the fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

The total square footage of the sandcastle is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in the sandcastle. 

The average square footage of a level is 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the remaining days is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is:
$2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers * $0.50 per flower = $9

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive option:
Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we need to find the closest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 18, which is 18. To find the number of packages of 3 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
18 / 3 = 6 packages of 3 flowers
6 packages of 3 flowers * $2.50 per package = $15
Since we still need 0 flowers, we don't need to buy any more packages of 3 flowers.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive option:
$15

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the more expensive option:
$15 - $9 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

Original price = $100
Discount percentage = 30%

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they each got 4 liters of water. So, together they got 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the water the girls got and the water the boy got from the total amount of water.

Total water initially = 24 liters
Water the girls got = 8 liters
Water the boy got = 6 liters

Water left = Total water initially - (Water the girls got + Water the boy got)
= 24 - (8 + 6)
= 24 - 14
= 10 liters

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We are given that W = L + 8. We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22. This simplifies to 2L + 8 = 22.

Now, we can solve for L by subtracting 8 from both sides: 2L = 22 - 8, which gives 2L = 14. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get L = 7. 

Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into the first equation: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next three years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply this increase for three consecutive years.

Salary after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726
Salary after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Salary after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Salary after 9 years: 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.85

We know that the total number of copies sold by both is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests who don't show up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 168 + 60 + 120
= 348

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the volume of a single tomato. Since each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes and they lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of the three tomatoes is 16 ounces. 

First, we find the volume of a single tomato by dividing the total volume of the can by the number of tomatoes: 16 ounces / 3 tomatoes = 5.33 ounces per tomato.

Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the cooked volume of a single tomato is 5.33 ounces / 2 = 2.67 ounces.

Now, we know that the total volume of the sauce made is 32 ounces. To find out how many tomatoes were used, we divide the total volume of the sauce by the cooked volume of a single tomato: 32 ounces / 2.67 ounces per tomato = 12 tomatoes.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the walls.

Inner dimensions of the box: 
- Length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
- Width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
- Height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box using the formula for volume: Volume = Length * Width * Height
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour (60 minutes) and 1 30-minute show, for a total of 90 minutes.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours, which is 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: 2 + 2 + 90 + 120 = 214 minutes.

The time he watched on Wednesday is the total time minus the time he watched on the other days: 420 - 214 = 206 minutes.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can divide the total time he watched on Wednesday by 30 to find the number of episodes: 206 / 30 = 6.8666. Since we can't have a fraction of an episode, we round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can have a fraction of an episode, so we will keep the decimal.

However, the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes, and since we can't have a fraction of an episode, we will round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we will keep the decimal because we can have a fraction of an episode."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. Since Henry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Marcell's roll-up: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both of them. 
Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people).
Average roll-ups = Total roll-ups / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how many seconds it takes her to row 10 feet by dividing 16 by 2. This is 16 / 2 = 8 seconds. 

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds by dividing 64 by 8. This is 64 / 8 = 8 sets of 10 feet.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rows 8 sets of 10 feet, the boat takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8 lessons.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons * 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings.

"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Next, we need to find the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar, which is 7/20. 

We can then multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120 teaspoons) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.
2. On the second day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles became 30.
3. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.
4. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles brought in on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4 containers.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means that if Adrien's salary is A, then Lylah's salary is A / 1.3 (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3 times).

2. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. This means that his new salary is 1.4 times his old salary. Since his old salary was $40000, his new salary is 1.4 * 40000 = $56000.

3. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40%, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% (assuming their salaries increased simultaneously). We need to find Lylah's original salary to calculate her new salary.

4. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation: A = 1.3L, where A is Adrien's original salary and L is Lylah's original salary. We know A = 40000, so 40000 = 1.3L. Solving for L, we get L = 40000 / 1.3 = 30769.23.

5. Now that we know Lylah's original salary, we can calculate her new salary: 1.4 * 30769.23 = 43056.52.

6. To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: 56000 + 43056.52 = 99056.52.

The final answer is: $99057"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. 

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find out how many sheets he uses in a month.

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep pattern.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Total hours = 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the distance covered in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. To find the distance covered in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances covered in both segments to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x.

Since Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

The total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie stamps 20 letters is x + 20.

We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, so we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 30

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

Let's start by finding the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we need to find the cost of an orange. Since an orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all the items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost of the doctors' time from the total amount charged to patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors:
500 patients per day * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes per day
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours per day

The cost of the doctors' time is:
200 hours per day * $150 per hour = $30,000 per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount charged to patients:
500 patients per day * $200 per hour * 24 minutes per patient / 60 minutes per hour = $20,000 per day

The profit is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the cost of the doctors' time:
$20,000 per day - $30,000 per day = -$10,000 per day

The hospital actually incurs a loss of $10,000 per day."

Now, we subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial number of elves:
60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find the number of elves left, we subtract 10 from the remaining elves:
40 - 10 = 30 elves left.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours:
8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours:

"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation W + B + Q = 700, we get 2B + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 2B + 3Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation 2B + 3Q = 700 to get 2(2Q) + 3Q = 700.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4Q + 3Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute Q = 100 into this equation to get B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we can substitute B = 200 into this equation to get W = 2(200) = 400.

The number of worker bees is 400."

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim calculates his total income each week to be $92, we can now calculate the profit.

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that left but not returned is now 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left but not returned come back. So, 75 bees return.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
2. James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
3. Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

From point 1, we can express the number of Dorothy's friends in terms of Charlie's friends: 
Let's denote the number of Dorothy's friends as D. Then, Charlie's friends can be expressed as 3D (since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy).

From point 3, we know that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3D = 12

To find the value of D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:
D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of James' friends using point 2: James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. 
So, James' friends = 4 * D = 4 * 4 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances to the same unit. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires.

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is 5 * 2 = 10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is 3 * 3 = 9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is 1 * 1 = 1.

The total number of tires inflated is 10 (bicycle) + 9 (tricycle) + 1 (unicycle) = 20.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost of inflating all the tires is 20 * 0.25 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the total cost of the cookies, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then multiply that by the cost per cookie.

Number of packs: 10
Cookies per pack: 6
Cost per cookie: $0.10

Total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies
Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies.

Change = $10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as x.

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are x - 14.
2. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, the seagull ate a total of 7 fries. Now, the remaining fries are (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Now, the remaining fries are (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30). The remaining fries are (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30) = (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3) * (x - 30) - 1 = 5.
6. Now, let's solve the equation (1/3) * (x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6
   x - 30 = 18
   x = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for the two sets of days: 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot): 3360 / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes for 2 months: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, the cost of the notebooks, and the cost of the bond paper, then add them together.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock from the total number of tadpoles that came out from under the lily pad.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles came out from under the lily pad, making it 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. However, 2 of them hid under a rock, so we need to subtract 2 from 17.

17 - 2 = 15

Therefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (2) and then divide by the denominator (3).

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the depth of the water on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80. 
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76. 
So, the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912. 
So, the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944. 
So, the price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328. 
So, the price after 12 months is $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943736. 
So, the price after 14 months is $59.71968 + $11.943736 = $71.663416.

After 16 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.663416, which is 0.20 * $71.663416 = $14.3326832. 
So, the price after 16 months is $71.663416 + $14.3326832 = $85.9960992.

After 18 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.9960992, which is 0.20 * $85.9960992 = $17.19921984. 
So, the price after 18 months is $85.9960992 + $17.19921984 = $103.19531904.

After 20 months, the price increases by 20% of $103.19531904, which is 0.20 * $103.19531904 = $20.639063808. 
So, the price after 20 months is $103.19531904 + $20.639063808 = $123.834382848.

After 22 months, the price increases by 20% of $123.834382848, which is 0.20 * $123.834382848 = $24.7668765696. 
So, the price after 22 months is $123.834382848 + $24.7668765696 = $148.601259418.

After 24 months, the price increases by 20% of $148.601259418, which is 0.20 * $148.601259418 = $29.7202518836. 
So, the price after 24 months is $148.601259418 + $29.7202518836 = $178.3215113016.

After 26 months, the price increases by 20% of $178.3215113016, which is 0.20 * $178.3215113016 = $35.66431226032. 
So, the price after 26 months is $178.3215113016 + $35.66431226032 = $213.98582356192.

After 28 months, the price increases by 20% of $213.98582356192, which is 0.20 * $213.98582356192 = $42.797164712384. 
So, the price after 28 months is $213.98582356192 + $42.797164712384 = $256.783988274304.

After 30 months, the price increases by 20% of $256.783988274304, which is 0.20 * $256.783988274304 = $51.3567976548608. 
So, the price after 30 months is $256.783988274304 + $51.3567976548608 = $308.140785929165.

After 32 months, the price increases by 20% of $308.140785929165, which is 0.20 * $308.140785929165 = $61.6281571858332. 
So, the price after 32 months is $308.140785929165 + $61.6281571858332 = $369.768943115. 

After 34 months, the price increases by 20% of $369.768943115, which is 0.20 * $369.768943115 = $73.953788623. 
So, the price after 34 months is $369.768943115 + $73.953788623 = $443.722731738.

So, the price after 36 months is $443.722731738 + $88.744546347576 = $532.467278085576.

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.47."
"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The cost of one action figure is $5. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the cost of the doll is 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we can add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures to find the total worth of all the toys:

$15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself:

Income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract the income she would have earned from the cost of hiring the accountant:

Cost of hiring the accountant - Income from doing taxes herself = $90 - $105 = -$15

Since the result is negative, it means that hiring the accountant will actually cost her money. However, the question asks how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, so we need to take the absolute value of the result:

$15

"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans and then divide that number by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Since Sandra needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan and she is making 15 flans, she needs a total of 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting job, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed (45) by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job (9).

45 / 9 = 5

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation (S = 2B):

S = 2(8)
S = 16

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 
From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 
The only bird left is Sally Thirtytwo, which we already know is 8 years old.

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out the total revenue and the total cost. 

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. 

The revenue from selling lemonade is the number of glasses sold multiplied by the price per glass. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon, the total number of glasses sold is 20g. The price per glass is $0.50, so the total revenue is 20g * $0.50 = $10g.

The cost of making lemonade is the cost of lemons plus the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. So, the total cost is (3 + 2)g = 5g.

The profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is given as $25. So, we can write the equation as:

$10g - 5g = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5g = $25

To find the number of gallons, we divide both sides by 5:

g = $25 / $5
g = 5

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the cost of lemons. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of lemons is 3g = 3 * 5 = $15.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
3. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs the three have together: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this as follows:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * Total votes
Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is 4x.

It's also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We are not given any information about the total number of flowers ordered, but we do know that Sandra is unhappy with the incomplete order delivery of red roses. Since we don't have any information about the total number of flowers, we can assume that the missing red roses are the only incomplete part of the order.

Since the number of red roses is 4x and the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, we can set up an equation to find the value of x. However, we don't have enough information to solve for x directly.

But we can use the information that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This implies that the missing red roses are the only incomplete part of the order, and we need to find the minimum number of red roses that Fred must deliver to keep Sandra's business.

Since we don't have any information about the total number of flowers, we can assume that the number of white carnations is a positive integer. Let's assume the number of white carnations is x = 1. This means the number of red roses is 4x = 4(1) = 4.

However, this is not the only possible solution. We can also assume that the number of white carnations is x = 2, which means the number of red roses is 4x = 4(2) = 8.

We can continue this process and find that the number of red roses can be 4, 8, 12, 16, and so on.

However, we are looking for the minimum number of red roses that Fred must deliver to keep Sandra's business. Since we don't have any information about the total number of flowers, we can assume that the minimum number of red roses is the smallest possible value of 4x.

The smallest possible value of x is 1, which means the minimum number of red roses is 4(1) = 4.

Therefore, the minimum number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm is 4."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the relationship between Mark's age two years ago and Jan's age two years ago. Let's denote Mark's age two years ago as M - 2 and Jan's age two years ago as J - 2. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so we can write the equation:

M - 2 = (1/2)(J - 2) + 5

Since we know Jan's current age is 30, we can substitute J = 30 into the equation:

M - 2 = (1/2)(30 - 2) + 5
M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5
M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's current age is 21, we can find Jean's current age. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can write:

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team's total time is the sum of each member's time, which is 55 seconds for each member. Since there are 4 members, the total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous runner, so the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the less well-rounded team's time from the well-rounded team's time: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 or 25%.

"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, half of that would be 20 / 2 = 10 apples. 

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 10 apples. 

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, the number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 3r * 6 = 18r.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 90, we can set up the equation 18r = 90.

To solve for 'r', we divide both sides of the equation by 18: r = 90 / 18 = 5.

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of buying the bags of wheat and the total cost of transporting them. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The cost of buying the bags is $20x.

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total cost of transportation is $2x.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying and the cost of transportation: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The trader sold the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the total revenue is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = $400 / $8 = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides, then add them together.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25 for 3 tickets. To find the cost per ticket, we divide the total cost by the number of tickets:
$20.25 / 3 = $6.75 per ticket.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. So, the cost of the food is:
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides:
$33 * 2 = $66.

Now, we add the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides to find the total cost:
$20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
$102 / 3 = $34.

"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find the total amount of insects needed per day, we first need to find the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock of ducks. 

Since there are 10 ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, the total amount of insects needed per week is:
10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find the amount of insects needed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, considering the trees he plants, chops down, and the ones that die.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years would be 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

Therefore, the number of trees left after 10 years would be 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has ($20) by the cost of one crayon ($2).

Number of crayons = Total amount / Cost per crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color (10 crayons / 5 colors = 2 crayons per color).

The total cost of the crayons will be the number of crayons multiplied by the cost per crayon:
Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 10 * $2
Total cost = $20

Since Violetta has $20 and the total cost of the crayons is also $20, she will not get any change.

Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers.
2. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
3. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
4. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, let's denote the number of sentences edited for each publisher as x. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000
Combine like terms:
2x = 1000
Divide both sides by 2:
x = 500

So, Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, and Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A, the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is:

500 * 5 = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the rate per sentence for Publisher B is 2 * 5 = 10 cents.

Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, so the total amount he makes from Publisher B is:

500 * 10 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, add the amounts from both publishers:

2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents

New salary = Current salary + Raise = $2000 + $100 = $2100

Since John works every week of the year, there are 52 weeks in a year. 
Total money made = New salary * Number of weeks worked = $2100 * 52

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the total kilometers for the next three weeks, and then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode his bike in the first four weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers in the first four weeks is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the next three weeks, Michael rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode his bike in the next three weeks is 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers in the next three weeks is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Let the cost of each cup be x.

Since 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, we can set up the equation:

20 * 12 * x = 6 * 6000 - 1200

First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

240x = 6 * 6000 - 1200

Next, let's simplify the right side of the equation:

240x = 36000 - 1200
240x = 34800

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is:
$5 * number of times she babysits.

Let's denote the number of times she babysits as 'x'. Then, the total amount she has earned from babysitting is $5x.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'y'. Then, the total amount she has earned from mowing the lawn is $4y.

The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money she already had, the money she earned from babysitting, and the money she earned from mowing the lawn:
$10 (initial savings) + $5x (babysitting) + $4y (mowing the lawn).

Since she wants to buy the jacket and shoes, the total amount of money she has must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the items:
$10 + $5x + $4y ≥ $70.

We want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we want to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. To do this, we can first subtract $10 from both sides of the inequality:
$5x + $4y ≥ $60.

Since we want to find the minimum value of 'y', we can try to eliminate 'x' from the inequality. However, we cannot do this directly, so we will try to isolate 'x' in terms of 'y'. We can do this by subtracting $4y from both sides of the inequality:
$5x ≥ $60 - $4y.

Now, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 5:
x ≥ ($60 - $4y) / 5.

Since 'x' must be an integer (you can't babysit a fraction of a time), we can try to find the smallest integer value of 'y' that makes ($60 - $4y) / 5 an integer.

Let's try different values of 'y' to find the smallest one that satisfies the inequality:
- If y = 5, then ($60 - $4y) / 5 = ($60 - $20) / 5 = $40 / 5 = 8, which is an integer.
- If y = 6, then ($60 - $4y) / 5 = ($60 - $24) / 5 = $36 / 5 = 7.2, which is not an integer.
- If y = 7, then ($60 - $4y) / 5 = ($60 - $28) / 5 = $32 / 5 = 6.4, which is not an integer.
- If y = 8, then ($60 - $4y) / 5 = ($60 - $32) / 5 = $28 / 5 = 5.6, which is not an integer.
- If y = 9, then ($60 - $4y) / 5 = ($60 - $36) / 5 = $24 / 5 = 4.8, which is not an integer.
- If y = 10, then ($60 - $4y) / 5 = ($60 - $40) / 5 = $20 / 5 = 4, which is an integer.

Since 'y' must be an integer, the smallest value of 'y' that makes ($60 - $4y) / 5 an integer is 5. However, we need to check if this value of 'y' satisfies the original inequality.

If y = 5, then x ≥ ($60 - $20) / 5 = 8. This means that Sara must babysit at least 8 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. However, she also needs to mow the lawn 5 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
= 2(6 + 1.5)
= 2(7.5)
= 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, the time he spends walking can be calculated by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
= 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total customers by Day 3: 500

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total customers by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total customers by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
= 500 - (100 + 150)
= 500 - 250
= 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of change of water in each pool is -4 gallons/minute. 

The time elapsed is 4 minutes, so the change in water in each pool is -4 * 4 = -16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

The initial amount of water in the small pool is 24 gallons. 

The current amount of water in the small pool is 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:
$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth borrowed with the additional 10% interest:
$2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she borrowed with interest:
$2200 - $1980 = $220

However, this is the amount she borrowed with interest, not the amount she borrowed. To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the amount she borrowed from the amount she borrowed with interest:
$2200 - $2000 = $200

So, the remaining balance will be $200."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. We also know that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. 

Let's represent the number of dahlias as D. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can write an equation: D = 4 + 7. 

D = 4 + 7
D = 11

Now that we know there are 11 dahlias, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). To find their ages in three years, we add 3 to each age.

Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points)
Jojo's points = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
Jojo's points = 251 - 197
Jojo's points = 54

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we subtract 90 from the initial amount of water in the tank.

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90 = 30 liters

Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we multiply the amount of water left by 2.

Rainwater collected = 2 * 30 = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank to find the total amount of water in the tank.

Total water in the tank = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected
= 30 + 60
= 90 liters

"To find the total number of flowers Andy planted, we need to find the number of petunias he planted and add it to the number of geraniums.

First, we know that Andy planted 90 geraniums. We are also told that he planted 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. To find the number of petunias, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

The final answer is: 140"

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initial total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 32 (water) = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:
Grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to follow the steps below:

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons were ready for harvest.
So, the remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest.
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.
So, the remaining melons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 days in a week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 

6 tomatoes/day / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend's consumption)

Now, we multiply the girlfriend's consumption by 7 days in a week.

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend's consumption)

Total tomatoes consumed per week = Steve's consumption + girlfriend's consumption
= 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week
= 63 tomatoes/week

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total tomatoes consumed per week by the tomatoes produced per vine.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:

"To find the total number of letters Mike receives from his pen pals, we need to calculate the number of letters from the 3 remaining pen pals and the 2 he stopped being pen pals with.

The 2 pen pals he stopped being friends with send 2 letters a week each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 letters a week. 

The 3 remaining pen pals send 2 letters a week each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week.

In total, Mike receives 4 + 6 = 10 letters a week.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike receives 10 * 5 = 50 pages a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 10 letters a week, which is 10 * 5 = 50 pages a week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so to find the total time he spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and multiply it by the time it takes to write one page.

Total pages written = 50 (received) + 50 (sent) = 100 pages

Time spent writing a week = 100 pages * 6 minutes/page = 600 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time spent writing a week = 600 minutes / 60 = 10 hours

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the cost for each day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since she needs it done 4 times a week, the cost for each week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $30,000 * 0.10 = $3000.

- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
- Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
- The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. Let's denote the total number of students as 'T'. Then, 50% of T is 27. 

We can write this as 0.5T = 27. To find T, we divide both sides by 0.5: T = 27 / 0.5 = 54.

Since there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60. However, we already found that the total number of students is 54. This is a contradiction, but we can continue with the information we have.

Since the total number of students is 54, and the total number of girls is 27, the total number of boys is 54 - 27 = 27.

Since the first class has 20 students and 15 of them are girls, the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5.

The second class has 20 students and 12 of them are girls, so the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13.

Since the total number of boys in the school is 27, and the number of boys in the first two classes is 13, the number of boys in the third class is 27 - 13 = 14.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today by multiplying 3 and x, which is 3 * 4 = 12.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 12 (today) = 22.

The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 22 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

"To find out how many times Anne went down the water slide, we need to calculate 30% less than Mitchel's 30 times. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, 30% less than 30 is 30 - 9 = 21. 

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went 21 times, Robert went 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8:
Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.00
40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00
20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00
40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values together:
$1.00 + $2.00 = $3.00
$3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00
$5.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. 

Cost of overdue books = 0.50 * 8 = $4.00

She also has to pay a flat fee of $2.00.

Total cost = Cost of overdue books + Flat fee
Total cost = 4.00 + 2.00
Total cost = 6.00

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has half as many bananas as apples, so Jamal has 44 / 2 = 22 bananas.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, but this is not possible since he has fewer bananas than apples. This statement seems to be incorrect or misleading. However, we can proceed with the information we have.
5. Since Jamal has 22 bananas and 44 apples, the total number of fruits Jamal has is 22 + 44 = 66.
6. Andrea has 52 apples, and we don't have any information about her bananas. However, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the fruits Jamal has to the fruits Andrea has: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 66 (Jamal's fruits) = 118.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she is making.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

In total, Carla will need 6 cups of flour for today and 5 cups of flour for tomorrow, so the total amount of flour needed is 6 + 5 = 11 cups.

"To find the total dollar amount of two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 9,300. 

Two-thirds of a number is calculated by multiplying the number by 2/3. 

So, we multiply 9,300 by 2/3.

9,300 * (2/3) = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to first calculate the total number of marbles she initially had in the 5 boxes. 

Number of marbles in each box = 50
Number of boxes = 5
Total initial marbles = Number of marbles in each box * Number of boxes
Total initial marbles = 50 * 5
Total initial marbles = 250

Now, Maddison gets 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the marbles she received to the initial total.

Total marbles now = Total initial marbles + Marbles received
Total marbles now = 250 + 20
Total marbles now = 270

2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. 
   So, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6.
   Then, we add 5 to this number: 6 + 5 = 11.
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.
The difference is 11 - 3 = 8.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, let's calculate the total fees paid:
Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Next, let's calculate the net proceeds from selling the house before paying the loan:
Net proceeds before loan = Selling price - Total fees = $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount:
Net proceeds = Net proceeds before loan - Remaining loan amount = $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.
2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. 
   To find the additional time, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.
   40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes.
   So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.
3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

Now, we need to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken. 
This is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook.
Total time = 28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900. So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800, the number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane:

Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed, it will take twice the time to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

Time = 2 * 8 hours = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. We can write this as an equation:

1/10 * x = 39

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available in total, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

The remaining chocolate bars for the children are 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars.

Since there are 8 children, to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many hours she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert her working hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges initially, so to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of activities for each day and then add them together.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total activities on Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total activities on Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total activities in two days: 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, we can assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals = 0.6 kg/day
Total rice consumed by 5 people per day = 0.6 kg/day * 5 people = 3 kg/day

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
Total rice available = 42 kg
Total rice consumed per day = 3 kg/day

Number of days a 42 kg bag of rice will last = Total rice available / Total rice consumed per day
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks:
1 week = 7 days
Number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last = 14 days / 7 days/week
= 2 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 2 less working days. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the target per day and multiply it by 5. 

Target per day = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Target for 5 working days = 17.14 * 5 = 85.7

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will round down to 85 crates.

Now, we can find out how many crates Sam was off from his target by subtracting the total crates sold from the target for 5 working days.

Crates off from target = 85 - 65 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the number of bids made by Carmen and the total amount she paid. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, she makes 3 bids. The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. 

The bids made by Carmen are as follows:
- 1st bid: $200
- 2nd bid: $250
- 3rd bid: $300

The total amount Carmen paid is the sum of these bids: $200 + $250 + $300 = $750.

The final numerical answer is: $750"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages and how they are arranged in the tabloid. 

In a standard tabloid, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front. 

Since the pages are folded, we can consider the left and right sides as separate entities. 

The left side has 16 pages (1-16), and the right side has 16 pages (17-32). 

However, when folded, the left and right sides are combined, so we need to consider the total number of pages as a single entity. 

Since the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front, we can see that the first and last pages are on the back and front of the same side, and the second and second-to-last pages are on the front and back of the same side. 

This pattern continues until the middle page, which is page 16. 

So, we can see that the number of pages is equal to the number of pages on one side (16) plus the number of pages on the other side (16), minus 1 (for the middle page, which is counted twice). 

Therefore, the total number of pages is 16 + 16 - 1 = 31.

However, this is the number of pages, not the number of pieces of paper. 

Since each piece of paper has two sides, we need to divide the total number of pages by 2 to get the number of pieces of paper. 

So, the number of pieces of paper is 31 / 2 = 15.5. 

However, since we can't have a fraction of a piece of paper, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we can calculate this as:

$50 / 2 = $25

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is:

$25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought:

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total number of books = 250
2. Number of unsold books = 50
3. Number of books sold this year = 45
4. Number of books sold in the first year = 2 * Number of books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90

Since the total number of books sold in the first two years is the sum of the books sold in the first year and the current year, we can calculate the number of books sold in the first two years as follows:

Number of books sold in the first two years = 90 + 45 = 135

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the first two years by subtracting the number of unsold books from the total number of books:

Total number of books - Number of unsold books = Number of books sold in the first two years
250 - 50 = 200

Since we already know that the number of books sold in the first two years is 135, we can confirm that our previous calculation is correct.

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the first year by subtracting the number of books sold in the current year from the number of books sold in the first two years:

Number of books sold in the first year = Number of books sold in the first two years - Number of books sold this year
= 135 - 45
= 90

Now, we can find the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold in the second year by the price of each book:

Number of books sold in the second year = Total number of books - (Number of books sold in the first year + Number of books sold this year)
= 250 - (90 + 45)
= 250 - 135
= 115

Price of each book = $20

Total amount of money earned in the second year = Number of books sold in the second year * Price of each book
= 115 * 20
= $2300

The final answer is: $2300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

So, John lost to 4 people."
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to first determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales and then calculate half of that amount.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning, so the number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown after 15 days.

The person will grow an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person will grow an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs. 

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

   Total cost of suits = 6 * $100 = $600

2. Calculate the cost of the suitcases:
   Number of suitcases = 3
   Cost per suitcase = $50
   Total cost of suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
   Cost of a business suit = $100
   Flight ticket cost = 5 * $100 + $700 = $1500 + $700 = $2200

4. Calculate the total expenses for the trip so far:
   Total expenses = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $2200 = $2950

5. Calculate the total amount Theo wants to save for the trip:
   Amount to save = $2000

6. Calculate the total amount Theo has spent so far and the amount he has left:
   Total spent so far = Total expenses

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, the number of players on the offense as O, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We are given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.

We are also given that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D, we get:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

4.5D = 105

Divide both sides by 4.5:

D = 105 / 4.5
D = 23.33

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a player.

D = 23

"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2. So, 2 people had previous commitments and didn't come due to illness. We subtract these 2 people from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the 6 people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (marbles bought from Johanna) + 8 (marbles given by his father) = 98.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196.

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, we can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:
Nongendered children = (1/10) * Boys = (1/10) * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x (since the ratio is 1:3).

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. 

The total number of people at the party is 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find the number of people who left, we multiply the total number of people by 1/4:

1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

The total number of people who left is 10, and 3 of them are men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract 7 from 15:

15 - 7 = 8

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8.

"Let's break down the information given:

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Then, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

72 / 8 = 9

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the effect of cooling the coffee and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening effect:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. The given ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. 

Let's assume the number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 'x'. Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, the number of new records received by the 5 people will be x/2.

We are given that the 5 people leave with 7 new records. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 7

To find the value of 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total number of junior and senior programmers, and then find their respective salaries.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers:
Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's calculate the total salary of junior programmers:
Total salary of junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Now, let's calculate the total salary of senior programmers:
Total salary of senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:
Total amount = Total salary of junior programmers + Total salary of senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. 

1. He eats 2 on his way to school: 24 - 2 = 22
2. He passes 14 out to his friends: 22 - 14 = 8
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28. So now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more that night: 36 - 3 = 33
5. He eats 2 more in the morning: 33 - 2 = 31

The final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find the total number of percentage points it needs to charge. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs to charge from 60% to 100%. 

The difference between 100% and 60% is 40 percentage points. 

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the total time it takes to charge 40 percentage points by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the sequence of events:

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on the last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount applied is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent on the current shopping trip: $43 - $12 = $31.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A: 
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the lower net income from the higher net income:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. We are given that H = 2C, and the total number of animals is 60, so C + H = 60. 

Substituting H = 2C into the second equation, we get C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20. 

Since H = 2C, H = 2 * 20 = 40. 

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. The total number of legs is 4C + 2H = 4 * 20 + 2 * 40 = 80 + 80 = 160.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he was juggling before the incident is 3 + 4 = 7.

However, 3 balls were lost during the incident. 2 were caught by the crowd, but 1 was lost completely. So, we subtract 1 from the total number of balls he was juggling before the incident.

7 - 1 = 6

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 6 balls on stage."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird.

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of the animals and the container: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 210 pounds.

Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours
Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since watching shows was 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 30% * Total time = 15 hours
To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal): Total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time: Time spent sightseeing = 40% * 50 hours = 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy had after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he had $10, we can set up an equation to find the number of pounds of candy he bought. Let's call the number of pounds 'x'. The equation is 1.5x + C = 10, where C is the change he had.

2. Since we don't know the change, we need to find it first. We know that he spent half of his change on gumballs, which cost $.05 each. He bought 40 gumballs, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the other half is also $2. Therefore, the total change he had is $4.

3. Now we can substitute the change into the equation from step 1: 1.5x + 4 = 10.

4. To find the number of pounds of candy, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation: 1.5x = 10 - 4, 1.5x = 6.

5. Now we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5 to find 'x': x = 6 / 1.5, x = 4.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total daily distance = 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total daily distance:
Days between services = Total distance before service / Total daily distance
= 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day
= 26.67 days

Since the train can't travel a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of days it goes between services, so we will round down to 26.67 days."

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 + 0.143 = 2.999 hours (approximately)

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home:

Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to return home
Total time taken for the trip = 2.999 + 3
Total time taken for the trip = 5.999 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

Total number of fourth-graders = 96
Number of girls = 43
Number of boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of girls = 96 - 43 = 53

Now, we know that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. So, the number of girls present = Number of girls - Number of girls absent = 43 - 5 = 38
The number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent = 53 - 4 = 49

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49. 

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and then add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's denote the number of points Erin had before as x. 

Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can express Erin's current points as 3 * Sara's points + Sara's points. 

We know Sara scored 8 points, so Erin's current points can be expressed as 3 * 8 + 8 = 32.

We are also given that Erin now has 14 points. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 14 = 32.

To find the number of points Erin had before, we need to solve for x. 

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 32 - 14 = 18.

Therefore, Erin had 18 points before. 

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total cost of the picture frames, we first need to calculate the cost of etching the logo. The cost of etching is 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is $20. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

So, the total cost of each picture frame, including etching, is $20 + $4 = $24.

The total cost of picture frames for all seniors is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers.

The total cost of cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of all the gifts is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is: $1198"

"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday, which is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty equipment and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. 
The value of the faulty equipment is 40% of $400,000. 
40% can be written as 0.4 in decimal form. 
So, the value of the faulty equipment is 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total amount spent to find the value of the functioning equipment:
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"

"To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for monthly payments on a loan:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount (initial loan amount) = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.10/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = 3650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650 [ 0.008333(1.008333)^5 ] / [ (1.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650 [ 0.008333(1.04516) ] / [ 1.04516 - 1]
M ≈ 3650 [ 0.008733 ] / [ 0.04516 ]

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies for 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue will be the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. However, we need to know how many hours she operates the stand to find the total revenue. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, she will sell all of the lemonade in 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

The total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Now, we subtract the initial cost of $18 from the total revenue to find the profit. 

Profit = Total Revenue - Initial Cost
Profit = $36 - $18
Profit = $18

Since we want to find the profit per hour, we divide the profit by the number of hours she operates the stand.

Profit per hour = Profit / Number of hours
Profit per hour = $18 / 9
Profit per hour = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the information that he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. 

Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We can set up the equation:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

The average number of stripes is the total number of stripes divided by the total number of zebras, which is 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required and then multiply it by their respective costs.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide 20 by 4:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:

5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:

5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of their individual costs:

$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns initially.
2. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
3. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.
4. Now, Allan has 80 (initial corns) + 60 (new corns) = 140 corns in total.

To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis, we add the total number of corns and cannolis: 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he completed before the jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can find out how many steps he took during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

Total steps wanted: 10,000
Steps completed before jog: 6,000
Steps left after jog: 2,000

Steps taken during jog = Total steps wanted - Steps completed before jog - Steps left after jog
Steps taken during jog = 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during jog = 2,000

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total number of words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time taken to read the book = Total number of words / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, Toby will be at the airport in 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so to find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the time he will arrive from the time he has to be there:

Time early = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000."
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can consider it as a 2-pound purchase with a discount on the second pound. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is 1/2 off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent by Tim is the sum of the discounted cost of the fireworks and the cost of the finale firework, which is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. To find the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

However, the problem states that these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means that 1% of them will explode. So, the number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode is 0.01 * 2500 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: (45 + x) + 105 = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get 150 + x = 500.

Subtracting 150 from both sides, we get x = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve this system of linear equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given in the problem.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km
So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 km.

The total distance covered in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered on that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

The total distance covered during the entire trip is the sum of the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation = 10,000 feet
Distance fallen = 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell = 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation.

Elevation where the comb fell = 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation = 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb = 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps below:

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30, which is (3/5) * 30 = 18.

Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

3. Substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: 
   (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 
   T - 6 + 2T = 18.

5. Combine like terms: 
   3T - 6 = 18.

6. Add 6 to both sides of the equation: 
   3T = 24.

7. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
   T = 8.

8. Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans (T = 8), we can find the cost of the jogger jeans (J) using the equation from step 1: 
   J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

9. The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders. 

Let's assume the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).

The total number of birds attracted to all 6 feeders is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders. We are given that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, but this is not the case here. Instead, we are given that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. So, the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 20 - 10 = 10 birds per feeder. 

So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 10 = 30 birds. The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * (20) = 60 birds.

The total number of birds attracted to all 6 feeders is 30 + 60 = 90 birds.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny needs to make from selling his cards. Since the ticket costs $100 and he already has $50, he needs to make $100 - $50 = $50 from selling his cards.

Since he plans to sell each card for $1.5, we can divide the amount he needs to make ($50) by the price per card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he needs to sell:

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we know he must have sold at least 34 cards to have enough money. 

Now, let's consider the information that Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards. If he sold 34 cards, then he must have had 34 + 34 = 68 cards initially."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since he prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, he prepared for 36 / 2 = 18 guests to have two hotdogs. This means he prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 guests in total wanted hotdogs, and since 36 hotdogs were already prepared, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To find the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first determine the number of dragons Prince Walter slew, then find one-fifth of that number.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew (3/4) * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew (1/5) * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 of 3 gallons is (1/4) * 3 = 0.75 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 0.75 gallons to pints. 

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, he must have spent 99% of his money. 

Let's assume George had x dollars initially. Then, 99% of x is equal to $5. 

0.99x = 5

To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George had $5.05 initially. 

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount he spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.05 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to determine the total weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom each have. 

Since there are 8 pieces in total and each piece is equal in weight, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece. 

Weight of each piece = Total weight of the cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the total weight of the two pieces they have. 

Total weight of the pieces they have = Weight of each piece * 2
Total weight of the pieces they have = 2.5 ounces * 2
Total weight of the pieces they have = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight of the pieces they have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces they have
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. However, the length is given in yards, so we need to convert it to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: width = area / length. Plugging in the values, we get width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula perimeter = 2 * (length + width). Plugging in the values, we get perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in the number of beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:

40 + 15 = 55 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so for 30 minutes, it cools down:

(30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Now, subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature after the oven is on:

55 - 6 = 49 degrees

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

The time it took Jon to complete the swim is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so we need to find 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So, James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

The time it took Jon to complete the bike ride is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes to complete the bike ride.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 10 minutes more than the total time it took Jon. 

The total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 

Since James took 10 minutes longer than Jon, the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We know that James took 36 minutes to complete the swim and 85 minutes to complete the bike ride. To find the time it took James to complete the run, we need to subtract the time it took him to complete the swim and bike ride from the total time it took him to complete the triathlon.

Time taken by James to complete the run = Total time taken by James - (Time taken by James to complete the swim + Time taken by James to complete the bike ride)
= 180 - (36 + 85)
= 180 - 121
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we first need to find out how many miles the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can find the distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay will be 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: 
Change = Total money - Cost of hay = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses Rozanne can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays Rozanne can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey has after his turn, we need to add the points he scored to his initial points. 

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

To find out how many points Marcy has after her turn, we need to add the points she scored to her initial points.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's total points and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

Since the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket alone is $20 - $1 = $19. 

However, we know that the regular price of the movie ticket is $12. So, the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $19 - $12 = $7.

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $7 - $3 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new cost. 

Total cost = New cost * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the sapphires remains the same, $6400.

The value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies together:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $8800

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $8800.

The final answer is: $8800"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the total number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means that 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the initial 50 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Total puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total puppies = 8 + 12
Total puppies = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 

Total puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total puppies with spots / Total puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight of feed / Truck's capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans are 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Grayson's total earnings from recycling in a four-week month are 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to first determine the number of plants Toni has, and then subtract 7 from that number.

Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the length of the shark is given in feet, we'll convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, each 0.5 feet long, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. We know that she spent $300 on the books and each book costs $15. 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of children
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15. However, since 3 kids are allergic to both, we have counted them twice. To correct this, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both: 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we have the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.

There are 3 groups of 200 employees, so the total number of employees is:
3 * 200 = 600

There are 7 tour guides for each group, and there are 3 groups, so the total number of tour guides is:
3 * 7 = 21

The total number of people going on the tour is the sum of the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides:
600 + 21 = 621

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to determine the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can set up the following equation:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny

Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now that we know the weight of the 2010 penny, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84

The final answer is: 84"

"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply the number of songs Gabriel has by 3. 

Gabriel has 20 songs, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. 
Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their player. 
The maximum capacity of the player is 100 songs. 
Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player.
Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. 

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, the total amount of money he gave up is 24 * 10 = $240.

"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

"To find the total number of hours James runs per week, we need to first find the total number of miles he runs per week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles per week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs per week by dividing the total miles per week by his speed. 

Total hours per week = Total miles per week / Speed = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs, we divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Number of Pomeranians = 18

Next, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Number of girl Pomeranians = 6

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 / $2 = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the 2 trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is:
24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 eggs can fit on the trays, so the number of eggs that won't fit is:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost of 2 packs will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since she buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1, she will get 8 razors (4 in each pack). The cost per individual razor will be $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Angela's current age be x.

In four years, Angela's age will be x + 4.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4 = 3 * 14

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get: x = 38

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $6/ride * 14 rides = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $2/ride * 14 rides = $28.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $84 + $28 = $112.

"To find out how many pies they can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by each of them is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now we can substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36, 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 364 / 2.

364 / 2 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

To find the total yards of yarn used, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends:
- 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so 2 x 5 = 10 gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so 3 x 2 = 6 gifts
- Total gifts for friends = 10 + 6 = 16 gifts

Now, let's add the 10 random gifts:
- Total gifts = 16 (for friends) + 10 (random gifts) = 26 gifts

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost of all 4 packs is $7.

We know that the total cost of the 3 non-strawberry packs is $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) = $3. 

Since the total cost of all 4 packs is $7, the cost of the 2 strawberry packs is $7 - $3 = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry packs by 2: $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since a 2 x 8 gives him the most sticks per dollar, we will use this type of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:
Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of sticks he can get from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood:
Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined: 40 + 80 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We are given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes.

We are also given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This can be represented as:

4x = 12 (for onions)
4y = 4 (for potatoes)

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 12 / 4 = 3 (onions)
y = 4 / 4 = 1 (potatoes)

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To find the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to subtract his birthday from the current date. 

December 31st to July 19th is approximately 6 months and 19 days. 

There are 30 days in a month, so 6 months is 6 * 30 = 180 days. 

Adding the remaining 19 days, we get 180 + 19 = 199 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 199 ≈ 527 calories.

The final answer is: 527"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works 7 days a week, his total earnings for the week would be 7 days * $30/day = $210.

Gerald spent a total of $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings: $210 - $100 = $110.

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

First, we need to find out the total distance of 8 laps. Since each lap is 0.25 km, we multiply the number of laps by the distance of each lap: 
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. To find out how many milliliters she needs to drink for 2 km, we multiply the distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. Assuming the problem is asking for the profit per bag, we can calculate it as follows:

Profit per bag = (Selling price - Cost per bag) per bag
= ($8 - $4) per bag
= $4 per bag
Since there are 40 bags in total (8 packs * 5 bags per pack), the total profit is:
Total profit = Profit per bag * Total number of bags
= $4 * 40
= $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he threw punches in and multiply it by the average number of punches per minute.

Since the fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, the total number of minutes is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes by the average number of punches per minute: 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
   3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

- 2 skeins for a hat
- 4 skeins for a scarf
- 12 skeins for a sweater
- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total skeins per child = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since there are 3 children, we multiply the total skeins per child by 3:
Total skeins for all children = 19 * 3 = 57

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool."
"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Chris on Monday and Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Monday and Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Chris on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to find the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, we add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the question asks how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, and each batch takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

Since she has 9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies, we need to find out how many 3/4 cups are in 9 cups. To do this, we can convert 3/4 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 3/4 = 0.75. 

Now, we can divide 9 by 0.75 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make: 9 / 0.75 = 12.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh. 

After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024. 

The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house as follows:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, if 5 people are painting a whole house, we can divide the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by 5 to find the total hours it would take 5 people to paint a whole house:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: 172"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Let's denote the number of CDs Tom bought as 'x' and the number of headphones as 'y'. We know that the total cost of the items is $48, and the cost of one CD is $4. 

The total cost of the items can be represented by the equation: 4x + y = 48.

We also know that Tom bought one CD, so x = 1. 

Substituting x = 1 into the equation, we get: 4(1) + y = 48
4 + y = 48
y = 44

This means the headphone set cost $44. 

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. 

Let's denote the number of CDs he could have bought as 'z'. The cost of one CD is $4, so the equation is: 4z = 44

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: z = 11

This means Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios where he spent more hours than usual.

- For 6 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours each week, so the total hours for these weeks are 6 * 4 = 24 hours.
- For 2 weeks, Josh spent 5 hours each week, so the total hours for these weeks are 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
- For 1 week, Josh spent 6 hours, so the total hours for this week are 6 hours.

Now, we add up the total hours from all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

However, we still need to account for the remaining 2 weeks where Josh spent 4 hours each week. So, we add 2 * 4 = 8 hours to the total.

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 + 8 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in.
Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 1/3 of the number of people who got off, we need to find 1/3 of 21:
1/3 * 21 = 7

So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J8 and his cousin's age in 8 years as C8. 
   We know that C8 = 2 * J8 - 5.
3. Since Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30, we can substitute J8 = 30 into the equation from step 2.
   C8 = 2 * 30 - 5 = 55.
4. Now we know Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 55. 
   To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47.
5. The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer costs $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:

Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and the printer:

Total cost of computer and printer = Computer cost + Printer cost
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,100 + $700
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and printer from the total cost:

Total cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Total cost of computer and printer
Total cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Total cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, the number of girls and boys is 20 / 2 = 10 each.

2. The boys brought back 60 shells each. Since there are 10 boys, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 (number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) seashells.

4. Calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls: 600 + 4 * 60 = 600 + 240 = 840.

5. Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 840 / 10 = 84.

2. George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5.
3. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 3.
4. Solving for x, we get: x = 3 + 5 = 8.
5. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George initially, Nick had 2x = 2(8) = 16 candies.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, Anne's age can be calculated as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10 to his share, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8 from his total, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Since the month of April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half of the month will be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as y. Then, the daily savings in the second half will be 2y.

The total savings in the first half will be xy, and the total savings in the second half will be (30 - x) * 2y.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which should be equal to the monthly target of $1125. We can write the equation as:

xy + (30 - x) * 2y = 1125

Simplifying the equation:

xy + 60y - 2x * y = 1125

Combine like terms:

y(x - 2x + 60) = 1125

y(-x + 60) = 1125

Divide both sides by (-x + 60):

y = 1125 / (-x + 60)

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we need to find the value of y. However, we don't know the value of x yet. We can express y in terms of x, but we need to find a specific value for x to calculate the daily savings in the second half.

However, we can use the fact that the total savings for the month is $1125. We can express the total savings as the sum of the savings in the first and second half:

xy + (30 - x) * 2y = 1125

We can also express the total savings as the sum of the savings in the first half and the savings in the second half. Since the savings in the second half is twice the savings in the first half, we can write:

xy + 2xy = 1125

Combine like terms:

3xy = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

xy = 375

Now we have an equation with two variables. We can express y in terms of x:

y = 375 / x

We know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. This means that the savings in the second half is 2y, and the savings in the first half is y. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is equal to $1125.

We can write the equation as:

xy + 2y = 1125

Substitute y = 375 / x:

x(375 / x) + 2(375 / x) = 1125

Simplify the equation:

375 + 750 / x = 1125

Subtract 375 from both sides:

750 / x = 750

Multiply both sides by x:

750 = 750x

Divide both sides by 750:

x = 1

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

y = 375 / x
y = 375 / 1
y = 375

Since the savings in the second half is twice the savings in the first half, the daily savings in the second half is 2y:

Daily savings in the second half = 2y
= 2 * 375
= 750

The final answer is: $750"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of three apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of five oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of six peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, we add the costs of all the fruits together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get for completing 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Jairus and Jenny will get. 

$16 (Jairus) - $10 (Jenny) = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount of money Jeff gets is 4x.

The total amount of money they are dividing is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount of money Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 52 + 13 = 65 letters

Now, she re-writes the 65 letters she has already written: 65 + 65 = 130 letters

The total number of letters Elise has written is 130."
"This problem can be solved using the concept of exponential growth. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families (from the second round) calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families (from the third round) calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set that Jonathan wants. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan wants a play set five times larger, we can multiply 80 by 5 to get the total number of toys in Jonathan's desired play set.

80 * 5 = 400

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 2 = 400

where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

Cost of 5 notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
Cost of 2 pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Cost of 1 calculator: $12
Cost of 1 geometry set: $10
Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost. 
Discount amount: 10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3
Total cost after discount: $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the remaining amount.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
Commission on the first $1000 = 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

For the remaining $1500 ($2500 - $1000), she earns an additional 10% commission:
Commission on the remaining $1500 = 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission earned by Antonella = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the remaining $1500
= $300 + $150
= $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill needs in total, we first need to calculate the number of bottles he already has. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, he has a total of 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Since Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, he needs a total of 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the time it takes for Ray to swim a mile in cold water as C and the time it takes for Ray to swim a mile in warm water as W.

We are given that C = 16 minutes.

We are also given that W = 2 minutes more than twice as long as C. This can be written as W = 2C + 2.

Substituting the value of C, we get W = 2(16) + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and on a hot day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3C = 3(16) = 48 minutes.

Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3W = 3(34) = 102 minutes.

The difference in time = Time on a hot day - Time on a cold day = 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. First, let's find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per interval = 70 intervals

Now, we can find out how many pages she read in 70 intervals. 

2 pages per interval * 70 intervals = 140 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

"To find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, we need to use the information given about Richie's goals.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: 
R = M + 20

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation:
R = A + 45

Since we know that Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute R = 80 into both equations:
80 = M + 20
80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for M and A:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = R + M + A

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he has 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

He has $70 initially and spent $20 on wooden action figures, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left. 

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $50 left and 3 days, he can spend a maximum of $50 / $2 = 25 action figures.

However, we need to consider that he has $50 left, so he can only buy 25 action figures with the money he has, not the money he would have if he spent the maximum. 

So, the total number of action figures he bought from Sunday to Wednesday is 4 * 1 = 4 wooden action figures. 

The total number of action figures he bought from Thursday to Saturday is 25.

The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

To find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and add it to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature Maggie should set her oven to is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

The final answer is: 540.8"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to that, we get:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time as follows:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to that, we get:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44. The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will buy and the total cost of the boxes.

Since each box lasts 45 days and Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of days the contacts will last is 2 * 45 = 90 days.

Since 90 single-use contacts will last 90 days, the number of pairs of contacts Pete will buy is 90 / 2 = 45 pairs.

The discount on each box is 10% of $100, which is 0.1 * $100 = $10. So, the discounted price of each box is $100 - $10 = $90.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90 = $180.

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180 / 45 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to find out how many sets of 200 calories are in 1600 calories.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. B + R + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting equations 1 and 2 into equation 3, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
The second increase is 5 WPM, so the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To find the average, we add the measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight change for the first option from the weight change for the second option.

For the first option (eating Cheerios), Martin loses 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

For the second option (eating donuts), Martin gains 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is the weight gain for the second option minus the weight loss for the first option: 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given:

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex then calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 couples will be attending, which is 8 * 2 = 16 people. So, the total number of people Alex's friends are bringing is 10 + 16 = 26.

3. To find the total number of people attending, we add the people invited via email and the people Alex's friends are bringing: 300 + 26 = 326.

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 326 + 1 = 327.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Amazon cost = $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so the shipping cost is 2 * $4 = $8.

eBay cost = $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21

To find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon, we subtract the Amazon cost from the eBay cost.

Difference = eBay cost - Amazon cost = $21 - $20 = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet. 

Since the beanstalk doubles in height every day and starts at 4 feet, we can calculate its height for each day as follows:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein content per gram of mushroom by dividing the protein content by the weight of the mushroom: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushroom.

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can find the protein content per day by multiplying the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein content per gram of mushroom: 200 grams * 0.03 grams/gram = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find the protein content per week, we multiply the daily protein content by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve for x, we can expand the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Subtract x from both sides:

0 = x - 10

Add 10 to both sides:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins to cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
Total money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many Colby can buy:
Number of gumballs = Total money / Cost per gumball = 345 / 5 = 69

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs, so the total number of dog legs is 5 x 4 = 20.

Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats, so the total number of cat legs is 2 x 4 = 8.

Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds, so the total number of bird legs is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve gets each year and then add them up over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

Now, we add up the total number of games Steve gets over the three years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional time = Total time - Initial time
Additional time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional time = 2 hours

"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa make 60 and 45 pounds of chocolates per hour respectively. To find the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours, we add their hourly production and multiply by 12.

Total chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Total chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours = 45 * 12 = 540 pounds

Total chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours = 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups of lemonade he sold and multiply it by the average price per cup.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour. So, in four hours, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups.

In the next two hours, he sold 10 cups per hour. So, in two hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

The total number of cups of lemonade he sold is 60 + 20 = 80 cups.

The average price per cup is (0.50 + 0.60) / 2 = 0.55 dollars.

The total amount of money Patrick earned is 80 * 0.55 = 44 dollars.

"To find the number of rotations per mile, we divide the total rotations by the number of miles. 

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations/month

The total number of rotations in a year is:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months = 1,740,000 rotations/year

To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year:

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. The final cost of the items is $42.

Now, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has. $50 - $42 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total number of pounds of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen croissants/day * 7 days/week = 28 dozen croissants/week

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we multiply the total number of dozen croissants by 12 to get the total number of croissants.

28 dozen croissants/week * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants/week

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter per dozen.

1/4 pound/dozen * 28 dozen = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * Total number of seats
Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * 72
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18

Now, we need to find the number of remaining seats after the administrators occupied their seats. 
Remaining seats = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats = 72 - 18
Remaining seats = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * Remaining seats
Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * 54
Number of seats occupied by parents = 18

Now, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the students. 
Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Number of seats occupied by parents
Number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18
Number of seats occupied by students = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to find the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 street lights are not working. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-working lights from the total number of lights: 96 - 20 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to the number of times each can be played before breaking, and then add those two totals together.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played before breaking to the number of times each has already been played: 356 + 644 + 135 + 865 = 2000.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended physical therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, the total number of hours he attended physical therapy is:

6 weeks * 2 sessions per week * 2 hours per session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125. Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is:

24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000

The final answer is: $3000"
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour intervals are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per interval = 4 intervals

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per 2-hour interval, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so in total, he chews 4 (during school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When his sister asks for gum, he gives her half of the remaining gum. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7.

So, Jim gives his sister 7 pieces of gum, leaving him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to first find her current age. 

Since Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is:
9 * $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is:
8 * $14 = $112

Now, let's find the difference between the amounts spent by the two coaches:
$112 - $27 = $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

Number of bloomed flowers = (4/5) * 200
= 4 * 200 / 5
= 800 / 5
= 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds

Ashley's internet connection speed in kb/s is 20 kb/s. To convert it to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour to get the speed in Mb/h:
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The number of cars towed on the remaining days is 7 - 3 = 4 days. Since 4 fewer cars were towed on each of these days, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

The total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Finally, let's divide the difference by Adam's growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them:
Profit = Selling price - Cost to acquire
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profit:
Commission = Profit * 0.1
Commission = $175,000 * 0.1
Commission = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. 

25% of 100 is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. 

60% of 25 is 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women, the remaining riders must be men.

Number of men = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women
= 25 - 15
= 10 men.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of truck and rose stamps he purchased.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom, and then use it to calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up.

Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

The distance between them is 75 miles. To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60. If each class costs $10, then the total cost of the classes he attends is 10(10 - x).

The total cost of the classes he attends should be equal to or less than $60. We can set up the inequality:

10(10 - x) ≤ 60

Expanding the inequality, we get:

100 - 10x ≤ 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get:

-10x ≤ -40

Dividing both sides by -10, we get:

x ≥ 4

Since x represents the number of classes Manny can miss, we round down to the nearest whole number because he can't miss a fraction of a class. Therefore, Manny can miss 3 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total weekly production for the two, we first need to determine how many customers each of them processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
Bonus = half a month's salary = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = new monthly salary + bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fishio received 2000 likes initially.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
   So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.
3. The total number of likes after 3 weeks is the sum of the initial likes and the likes received in the 3 weeks.
   However, we don't know the number of likes received in the 3 weeks. We only know the number of likes after 3 weeks.
   Since the number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000, and the initial number of likes is 2000, the number of likes received in the 3 weeks is 140000 - 2000 = 138000.
4. Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost is:
20 * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats are $400, and we can write the equation:

$400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = $800

So, in the first month, Ariadne's total sales were $800 (red) + $800 (green) = $1600.

2. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's denote the total sales of the first month as M1 = $1600. Then, the total sales of the second month (M2) are:

M2 = 3/4 * M1
M2 = 3/4 * $1600
M2 = $1200

3. To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months:

Total sales = M1 + M2
Total sales = $1600 + $1200
Total sales = $2800

"To find the cost of each mixture, we need to calculate the cost of almonds and walnuts separately and then combine them.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = $10 - $7
Difference = $3

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and goose has one head, we can set up the following equation:

S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G:

G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds. The cost of the more expensive brand is $6 per pound, so the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the $20.00 he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: 193"
"To find the total number of hours John spends in the class, we need to multiply the number of hours per class by the number of classes per week and then by the number of weeks.

Hours per class = 2
Classes per week = 4
Weeks = 6

Total hours per week = 2 * 4 = 8
Total hours for 6 weeks = 8 * 6 = 48

Since John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes he learns.

Total hours = 48
Recipes per hour = 1.5
Total recipes = 48 / 1.5 = 32

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know that Aurelia has $120. 

Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. 
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, we have the money of all three: Aurelia ($120), Kassidy ($90), and Rayna ($150). 

To find out how much they would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to add their money and divide by 3.
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

Now, we divide the total money by 3 to find out how much each would have:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the length of the regular game and then add the extra time played in the last quarter.

The regular game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total length of the regular game is:
4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since the game was extended for 5 minutes in the last quarter, we need to add this extra time to the total length of the regular game:
48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted for 53 minutes."
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to first find the number of management employees and then find 30% of that number.

First, we find the number of management employees: 
20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Then, we find 30% of the management employees:
30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount of candy by the number of people. 

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. Now, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. So, he needs 16 more toys. Now, he has 12 (previous toys) + 16 (additional toys) = 28 toys for 28 dogs.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Now, he has 28 - 3 = 25 toys for 25 dogs.

However, the question asks for the total number of toys James needs. Since James has 25 toys, but he needs one toy for each dog, and there are 25 dogs, he still needs 25 toys.

Total signatures currently = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. 

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal. 

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

The sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = average weight per adult * number of adults
Total weight = 80 kg * 9
Total weight = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. So, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and Max has 73 cookies. So, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress: the 50% extension and the 20cm addition.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

The 50% extension means the dress is now 150% of its original length, which can be expressed as 1.5x.

The 20cm addition is added to this extended length, making the final length 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for x:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm."

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age of all three is 2T + t = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can express the age of the older twin as t + 7.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2T + t = 44
2) T = t + 7

We can substitute the second equation into the first one:

2(t + 7) + t = 44

Expanding the equation:

2t + 14 + t = 44

Combine like terms:

3t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3t = 30

Divide both sides by 3:

t = 10

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin:

T = t + 7
T = 10 + 7
T = 17

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of 4 candies by 4: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30 per candy.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. To find the total number of coins Rong saves in 10 years, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 (months in a year) and then by 10 (years).

Rong's total savings = 20 * 12 * 10 = 2400 coins

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find Neil's monthly savings, we multiply Rong's monthly savings by 2/5 and then add it to Rong's monthly savings.

Neil's monthly savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins

Now, we find Neil's total savings over 10 years.

Neil's total savings = 28 * 12 * 10 = 3360 coins

To find the total number of coins they have after 10 years, we add Rong's total savings and Neil's total savings.

Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings
Total coins = 2400 + 3360
Total coins = 5760

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can express it as 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides: x - 0.6x = $40. This simplifies to 0.4x = $40.

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. Since John brought $125 with him, he will leave with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square (1 foot * 1 foot = 1 square foot).

The comforter has 14 red squares. 
The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
The comforter has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
The comforter has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Since babies also need chairs, we need to add the number of babies to the number of adults to get the total number of chairs needed.

Now, we subtract the number of chairs the restaurant already has from the total number of chairs needed to find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get.

Total chairs needed = 57
Total chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

Let's start by finding Betty's points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate her points as follows:

Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
= 50 + (0.3 * 50)
= 50 + 15
= 65

Now, we know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so we can calculate Tom's points as follows:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
= 65 - 30
= 35

We are also given that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so we can calculate Martha's points as follows:

Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
= 3 * 35
= 105

Now, we can find the total points collected by the class:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
= 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
= 255

To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:

Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
= 400 - 255

"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box, which is 20.

Total pencils in the box = 20 - 4 = 16

Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = Total pencils in the box / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find the total number of fireworks set off in the city and then calculate 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

40% of 300 is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, so the total number of fireworks she will set off is 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of fireworks Hannah will see is the sum of the fireworks set off in the city and the ones she will set off in her backyard, which is 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks bought will be 2 * 20 (for drinks) + 3 * 20 (for snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks.

The total number of items (drinks and snacks) bought is 40 + 60 = 100.

Each item (drink or snack) costs $2. Therefore, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 * $2 = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. Since the three trucks combined can carry 11,600 pounds, Gary's truck must be able to carry 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: 2800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 8 males and 6 females, so the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.
2. Each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.
3. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
4. The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.
5. The total number of dumplings eaten by all people is 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.
6. Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying his share by the total amount: (3/5) * 100 = 60.

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald is left with 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount they need to raise per hour is $2100 / 3 = $700.

To find the total number of hours they need to fundraise, we can divide the total amount they need to raise ($4200) by the amount they need to raise per hour ($700).

$4200 / $700 = 6

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 80% = 20% of the water used by the city.

To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we multiply the percentage of the river's water used by the city by the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by the city:

40% * 20% = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.08 * 100 = 8%

Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production rate per hour for both types of ice cream:

50 quarts per hour (chocolate) + 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts per hour

To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply the total production rate per hour by 48:

62.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

1. Cost of croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
2. Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
3. Cost of mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
4. Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops."
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then subtract the amount eaten by Ginger from the amount eaten by Amy.

There are 7 days in a week, so there are 14 days in two weeks.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to find the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"

"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price.

Total amount = Number of computers * New price of each computer

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation:

Length of Topher's shoe = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Substituting the value of the length of Topher's shoe (100 inches), we get:

100 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Now, we can solve for the length of Bobby's shoe by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

90 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to isolate the length of Bobby's shoe:

Length of Bobby's shoe = 90 / 9
Length of Bobby's shoe = 10

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

We know that the total number of students who like to play video games or music is the total number of students minus the students who like to bake and basketball. 

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - Students who like to bake - Students who like to play basketball
= 50 - 10 - 5
= 35

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is the total number of students who like to play video games or music minus the number of students who like to play music.

Students who like to play video games = Students who like to play video games or music - Students who like to play music
= 35 - 10
= 25

"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12. 

1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we subtract the number of birds that were scared away from the initial number of birds to find the number of fearless birds left. 

12 - 4 = 8

Then, we add the 20 birds that joined the fearless birds to find the total number of birds in the backyard.

8 + 20 = 28

"Let's denote the number of students in each class as x. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We are given that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Now that we know the total number of students in each class is 40, we can find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, the number of girls in each class is 40% of 40, which is 0.4 * 40 = 16. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

Number of boys in each class = Total number of students in each class - Number of girls in each class
= 40 - 16
= 24

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24.

The final answer is: 24"

"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400.

The total value of the cards Mark got is the sum of the values of the two high-value cards and the 30 cards: $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The profit is the total value of the cards minus the total cost of the packs: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost for each amusement park, we need to calculate the cost for the adults and the children separately and then add them together.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $26 = $52
- Cost for children: 2 children * $12 = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14 = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10 = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

The final answer is: $350"

"To find the number of students per group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

Number of students = 54
Number of groups = 6

Students per group = 54 / 6 = 9

Now, we are told that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of students per group by the total number of groups required.

Total students = 9 * 12 = 108

However, we already know that there are 54 students. Since the total number of students is less than the calculated total, we need to find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students.

Number of groups that can be formed = 54 / 9 = 6

Since the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find the difference between the required number of groups and the number of groups that can be formed.

Number of groups needed = 12 - 6 = 6

2. Gunther added 25 bananas: 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
3. Arnold stole 12 bananas: 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.
4. Gunther added 6 bananas: 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to first find out how much they will pay per month and then multiply it by 12.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, they will divide the bill equally among themselves. 

$100 (monthly bill) / 4 (number of roommates) = $25 per roommate per month.

To find the yearly amount, we multiply the monthly amount by 12.

$25 (monthly amount) * 12 (months in a year) = $300 per roommate per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons.

The total number of council members is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, we can calculate it as:

2x = 2 * 11
2x = 22

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, to find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply the number of girls by 3.

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3 = 18

We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's represent the total number of puppies as 'x'. Then, two thirds of 'x' is equal to 18.

(2/3)x = 18

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies."
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the allowance from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house is x/2.

The third house needs double the first house, so the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2) = x.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know x, we can find the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house:

The third house needs x = 100 cases of shingles.

"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges he needs to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 times 4 kilograms to make 4 liters of juice.

5 kilograms/liter * 4 liters = 20 kilograms

Now that we know Sam needs 20 kilograms of oranges, we can calculate the total cost. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so we multiply the number of kilograms by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total time available - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
= 12 - 3 - 3
= 6 hours

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph. To find the time it takes to drive to the museum, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total time spent driving is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time spent at the museum (6 hours), the total time Jack is gone from home is:

4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = 600 * (1/3) = 200

Since Mike can get these movies for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie, the cost of the movies in series is:

Cost of movies in series = 200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we need to find the number of remaining movies first. The number of remaining movies is:

Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200 = 400

Number of older movies = 400 * (40/100) = 160

The cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series or older movies. This is:

Number of remaining movies = 400 - 160 = 240

The cost of the remaining movies is:

Cost of remaining movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance driven. They drove for 4.5 hours (6 hours total - 1.5 hours hiking) at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance driven is 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Now, we add the distance hiked and the distance driven to find the total distance to the vacation spot. 30 miles (hiked) + 225 miles (driven) = 255 miles.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - (x + 4)) because the total time for the level is 60 seconds.

The score for Emma is x + (number of enemies Emma jumps on) + (number of berries Emma collects) + (time left on the timer for Emma).
The score for Ava is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (60 - (x + 4)).

Simplifying Ava's score: (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (60 - (x + 4)) = x + 8 + x + 3 + 60 - x - 4 = 2x + 7.

The score for Emma is x + (number of enemies Emma jumps on) + (number of berries Emma collects) + (time left on the timer for Emma).
Since we don't know the number of enemies Emma jumps on or the time left on the timer for Emma, we can represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on as x - 8 (since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma) and the time left on the timer for Emma as (x + 4) (since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma).
The score for Emma is x + (x - 8) + 3 + (x + 4).

Simplifying Emma's score: x + (x - 8) + 3 + (x + 4) = x + x - 8 + 3 + x + 4 = 3x - 1.

The difference between their scores is (2x + 7) - (3x - 1) = 2x + 7 - 3x + 1 = -x + 8.

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact difference between their scores. However, we can express the difference in terms of x.

However, we can express the difference in terms of x, but we can also express the difference in terms of the number of enemies Emma jumps on and the time left on the timer for Emma. 

Let's assume the number of enemies Emma jumps on is y. Then the number of enemies Ava jumps on is y + 8.
The time left on the timer for Emma is (60 - (y + 4)) because the total time for the level is 60 seconds.

The score for Emma is y + 3 + (60 - (y + 4)).
The score for Ava is (y + 8) + 3 + (60 - (y + 4)).

Simplifying Ava's score: (y + 8) + 3 + (60 - (y + 4)) = y + 8 + 3 + 60 - y - 4 = 8 + 59 = 67.

Simplifying Emma's score: y + 3 + (60 - (y + 4)) = y + 3 + 60 - y - 4 = 59 + 3 = 62.

The difference between their scores is 67 - 62 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, we can subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts. 

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times. 

On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. Since there are two such days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the two extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish Bob bought as 'o'. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 'w' white fish and 'o' orange fish, he had a total of 3 + o + 4 + w = 7 + w + o fish in the pond. 

Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: o = 2w.

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so w + o = 17.

Substituting o = 2w into the second equation, we get w + 2w = 17, which simplifies to 3w = 17.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get w = 17/3.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a fish, we need to re-examine the problem. The issue here is that the total number of fish in the pond after buying is not given, but we can use the information that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish to find the number of white fish Bob bought.

Let's denote the total number of fish in the pond after buying as 't'. We know that t = 7 + w + o, and o = 2w.

Substituting o = 2w into the equation t = 7 + w + o, we get t = 7 + w + 2w = 7 + 3w.

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so w + o = 17. Substituting o = 2w, we get w + 2w = 17, which simplifies to 3w = 17.

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total amount of gas consumed.

Since Andy travels to work and back home every day, the total distance traveled per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy works from Monday to Friday, the total number of working days in a week is 5.

The total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Given that Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas consumed per week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon. Therefore, the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, and then add them together.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. 

Value of quarters = 140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 

Number of twenties spent = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Value of twenties spent = 6 * $20 = $120

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 = 0.25 or 25% of the total. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 = 0.125 or 12.5% of the total.

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the percentage of smart and analog TVs from 100% to find the percentage of OLED TVs: 100% - 37.5% = 62.5%.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (62.5% or 0.625): 
40 * 0.625 = 25

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the temperature at which the pipes will freeze. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than the day, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

The temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the amount of heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4. 

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.
The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. 

Pierson's score is 278 and Nikita's score is 150. 

278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal together.

Number of stuffed puppies = 3
Number of stuffed koalas = 5
Number of stuffed zebras = 2
Number of stuffed frogs = 4

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up the equation:

Number of stuffed goats / Total number of stuffed animals = 0.30

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats as 'x'. We can rewrite the equation as:

x / 14 = 0.30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 14:

x = 0.30 * 14
x = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that the percentage of stuffed goats is at least 30%. 

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day. There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are 14 days. 

14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

In the additional week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. 

7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. 

Hours still needed to play = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost James paid, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900. 

30% of $900 is calculated as 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost of the ring before the premium is $900. Adding the premium, the total cost is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final numerical answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches of mosaic, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 38 / 4 = 9.5 gallons.

However, the question asks for the amount of tea at the beginning of the party. We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left, and we calculated that 38 quarts were consumed. To find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the remaining tea to the consumed tea: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (new candies) = 200 candies. 

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell 250 (100 initial + 150 sold), he still needs to sell 250 - 200 = 50 candies.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of May. 

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students. 

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial number of marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows used = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Initial number of marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can have is equal to the number of marshmallows left divided by 2 (since there are two kids).

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

The two friends who are worse than Jack can play for half as long, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. Since they can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, they each use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters. Since there are two of them, they use a total of 6 * 2 = 12 quarters.

The friend who is better than Jack can play for 1.5 times as long, so he plays for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 12 (worse friends) + 18 (better friend) = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tanya makes a salt scrub to fill a 10-ounce jar.
2. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
3. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
4. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
5. She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as Z, the amount of salt (and sugar) as S, and the amount of oil as O.

From point 5, we know that S = 2Z.

From point 4, we know that O = 2S.

Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

Now, we know that the total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of oil, salt, sugar, citrus zest, and fragrance. Since the amounts of salt and sugar are equal, and the amounts of citrus zest and fragrance are equal, we can write the equation as:

O + S + S + Z + Z = 10

Substituting O = 4Z and S = 2Z into the equation, we get:

4Z + 2Z + 2Z + Z + Z = 10

Combine like terms:

10Z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

Z = 1

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O:

O = 4Z
O = 4(1)
O = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already have = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already have
= 63 - 48

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from the total number of cars he had initially: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we know that 20 students raised this amount together. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students:

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars had left, which is (1/2) * 70 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break, which is the number of cars that were present in the parking lot during the lunch break, not the number of cars that left. Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to calculate the total amount he earns from one cycle and then multiply it by the number of cycles he does in a day.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns from one cycle is:
5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00 per cycle

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:
$6.00/cycle * 30 cycles = $180.00 per day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$180.00/day * 7 days = $1260.00

The final answer is: $1260.00"
"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has by substituting x = 47 into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price of the book.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping:

Cost per pound: $0.35
Weight of the book: 4 pounds
Cost per mile: $0.08
Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles

Cost of shipping = (Cost per pound * Weight of the book) + (Cost per mile * Distance to the distribution center)
Cost of shipping = (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
Cost of shipping = 1.40 + 1.60
Cost of shipping = 3.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
Refund amount = 75% of the purchase price
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Total loss = Cost of shipping - Refund amount
Total loss = 3.00 - 24
Total loss = -$21

However, since we cannot have a negative loss, we need to recalculate the total loss by considering the refund amount as a positive value and the shipping cost as a negative value (since it's a loss for Milly):
Total loss = Refund amount - Cost of shipping
Total loss = $24 - 3.00
Total loss = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. First, we add the initial amount of money Mulan had ($40) to the amount her father gave her ($100). 
   $40 + $100 = $140

2. Then, we subtract the cost of the two pairs of jeans ($30 x 2 = $60) from the total amount of money Mulan has.
   $140 - $60 = $80

3. Next, we subtract the cost of the bag ($20) from the remaining amount of money.
   $80 - $20 = $60

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

1. Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
2. Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
3. Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 1128"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors, 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier, and 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00, 1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00, and 10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00. 

The total cost is $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the lifting capacity of each person relative to Pompei. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since speed is inversely proportional to time, if the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance. 

Therefore, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo will take 54 hours multiplied by 2, which equals 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution: 
$150 (payment) + $80 (mom's contribution) = $230

Since the price of the new laptop is reduced by $200 when she trades in her old laptop, the new price of the laptop is:
$600 - $200 = $400

Now, we know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. So, the total amount of money she has is:
$400 (new price of the laptop) - $50 (amount she still needs) = $350

However, this is the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution. To find out how much money she had in her purse initially, we need to subtract her payment and her mom's contribution from this total amount:
$350 (total amount) - $230 (payment and mom's contribution) = $120

Therefore, Erika had $120 in her purse initially.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total number of apple slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the desired production by the production per cow: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used part is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used part is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used part is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used parts: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, we subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $4880.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $4880."
"To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount Thea gave the craftsman. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Thea gave the craftsman: 4 * $20 = $80.

The change Thea got is $10."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes

Total number of socks and dishes together = 90 + 90 = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

However, we are asked to find the number of students good at math. Since x represents the number of students good at both subjects, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) to x to get the total number of students good at math.

So, the number of students good at math is 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time available for performances, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert time - Intermission time = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time required for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can find the number of groups that can perform in the given time by dividing the time available for performances by the time required for each group.

Number of groups = Time available for performances / Time required for each group = 110 / 10 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount, which is 0.75 or 75% of the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period.

However, in this case, the interest rate is not a fixed percentage, but rather a fraction of the principal amount. So, we can calculate the interest for each year and add it to the principal amount.

Year 1: Interest = 0.75 * $300 = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = 0.75 * $525 = $393.75, Total = $525 + $393.75 = $918.75
Year 3: Interest = 0.75 * $918.75 = $688.0625, Total = $918.75 + $688.0625 = $1606.8125

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1606.8125."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars. This means that the remaining white shirts without collars would be 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. Since there are 50 floral shirts in total, the number of floral shirts without buttons would be 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars. This would be 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays:

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we first need to determine the number of goats sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats

"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's find the number of pairs of shoes James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24) to find the average cost per pair:

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 24

"To find the number of hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is one-half of 90. 

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to clean 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 = 87.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 5x = 77.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by 2.

Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 to find out how many packs are required.

Number of packs needed = Total glue sticks needed / 8 glue sticks/pack = 54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as (x + 30). We are given that the number of gold coins is 70. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 30 = 70.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: total_coins = 70 + 40

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S. 

We are given the following information:

1. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can use substitution to solve for F. 

From equation 2, we can express S in terms of A: S = A + 25.

Substituting this into equation 1, we get: (A + 25) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms: 2A + F + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides: 2A + F = 60

Now, we can express A in terms of F using equation 3: A = F - 12.

Substituting this into the equation above, we get: 2(F - 12) + F = 60

Distribute the 2: 2F - 24 + F = 60

"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone: 5 phones * $700/phone = $3500.

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays 40% of the total cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a four-week month, we can divide the amount Keenan spends per month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pizza pieces so far.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, then adding the results together.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3).

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3
Hourly rate = $11

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can multiply it by the number of hours she will work in the future (12) to find out her total earnings.

Total earnings = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Total earnings = $11 * 12
Total earnings = $132

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has:
52 + 28 = 80 marbles

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we need to calculate 1/4 of 80:
1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total:
80 - 20 = 60 marbles

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scored from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she scores 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she scores 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Selling price
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / Number of people selling glasses
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 32 / 2
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. To do this, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
Difference = 14 - 16
Difference = -2

The negative sign indicates that Micah sold more glasses than Julie. However, the question asks for the difference, which is a numerical value.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will get from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope:

Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * $2
Total amount of money = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = unknown (we don't know how long it is, but we can call it 'x')
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Cost of the new rope = x * $1.5

Since Sarah wants to buy the new rope with the profit from selling the old rope, we can set up an equation:

Total amount of money = Cost of the new rope
$40 = x * $1.5

To find the length of the new rope, we can divide both sides of the equation by $1.5:

x = $40 / $1.5
x = 26.67 meters

Now that we know the length of the new rope, we can calculate the cost of the new rope:

Cost of the new rope = x * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = 26.67 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $40

Since the cost of the new rope is equal to the total amount of money Sarah got from selling the old rope, she will have $0 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $0"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Melanie's current age be x.

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age plus 10 years is equal to 18. We can write this as an equation:

x + 10 = 18

To find Melanie's current age, we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number y. We can write this as an equation:

Melanie's age in y years = 3 * Melanie's current age
8 + y = 3 * 8

To find y, we can simplify the equation:

8 + y = 24

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

y = 24 - 8
y = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10 in total for 5 packs, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as 'x' minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. 

The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore, so the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes. We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Then, 2/3rd of 6 birds are flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
- In total, Ellen pays $11 for her goods.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the total cost of carrots is 2x.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since the total cost of all the goods is $11, we can set up the equation:

2x + 9 = 11

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 11 - 9
2x = 2

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x:

x = 2 / 2
x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week to find his weekly earnings: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 / 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), the total number of adult bowls that can be filled is 3. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl equals 2 child bowls. Therefore, 3 adult bowls equal 3 * 2 = 6 child bowls.

The total number of child bowls that can be filled is 8 (from the original statement) - 6 (filled by adults) = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 2 child bowls left, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 / 2 = 1 time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8 = 52

Now we can equate the two expressions:

52 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 to it.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Adding 100 acres to that gives us 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, to find the total number of acres of both farms, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can write this as:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10
Packages per hour = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday:

Total packages per day = Packages per hour * 8
Total packages per day = 40 * 8
Total packages per day = 320

Now, let's calculate Colby's daily earnings:

Daily earnings = Total packages per day * Package price
Daily earnings = 320 * $0.20
Daily earnings = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve a normal sudoku and an extreme sudoku, and then convert that to hours to match the rate at which he drinks water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

The total time spent on both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 225 / 60 = 3.75 hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to find out how many half hours are in 3.75 hours. We can do this by dividing 3.75 by 0.5 (since half hour is 0.5 hours): 3.75 / 0.5 = 7.5.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 + y.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

3y = 18

Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs in a 30-day month, we need to calculate the total miles driven in that time. 

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups are needed.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since the remaining money was used to buy these items, the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had is $31 + $31 (to cover the cost of the items they bought) = $62.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, each of them received half of the total amount, which is $62 / 2 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

Total fruits = 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits.

Fruits left = Total fruits - Fruits eaten by Lola
Fruits left = 14 - 2
Fruits left = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number are playing volleyball. So, the number of students playing volleyball is 2 * 6 = 12.

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball: 6 + 12 = 18.

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer: 18 + 16 + 22 = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so the total revenue per student is 10 * $0.8 = $8. 

Since there are 30 students, the total revenue is 30 * $8 = $240.

Next, let's find the total cost. The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, and each student sold 10 lollipops. So, the total number of lollipops bought is 30 * 10 = 300.

The total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day. 

Abby can eat 2 slices a day. 
Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they can eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the total number of months she has been collecting shells.

Total shells collected = 60 months

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. Therefore, she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as 9 - 4 = 5.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip. 

Let's break down the problem: 

- The sloth has 8 hours to collect 24 berries.
- Each trip down, up, and back takes 4 hours, so the sloth can make 8/4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.
- Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, let's call the number of berries picked per trip 'x'.
- The total number of berries picked in 2 trips is 2x.
- We want to find the minimum value of 'x' such that 2x = 24.

To find the minimum value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x = 24
x = 24/2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining budget Colby has for the month. 

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20

Since Colby wants to spend the remaining money on a movie, a popcorn, and a box of candy, the total cost for these items is $10 (movie) + $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $20.

This means Colby can see one more movie, buy one more popcorn, and one more box of candy with his remaining budget.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. Since a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories of a mini cinnamon roll would be 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, let's find the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. Since a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories and a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories of a mini blueberry muffin would be 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j. 

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old: P + p + j = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than John: p = j + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age: P = p + j

From equation 2, we can substitute p = j + 10 into equation 1: P + (j + 10) + j = 100
Combine like terms: P + 2j + 10 = 100
Subtract 10 from both sides: P + 2j = 90

From equation 3, we can substitute P = p + j into the equation above: (p + j) + 2j = 90
Substitute p = j + 10: (j + 10) + 2j = 90
Combine like terms: 3j + 10 = 90
Subtract 10 from both sides: 3j = 80
Divide both sides by 3: j = 80/3
j = 26.67

Now that we have John's age, we can find Paul's age using equation 2: p = j + 10
p = 26.67 + 10
p = 36.67

Now that we have Paul's age, we can find Peter's age using equation 3: P = p + j
P = 36.67 + 26.67
P = 63.34

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The total number of balloons is 24."

Option 1: 24-hour stay - 1600 pesos
Option 2: 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) + additional hours

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the 1000 pesos, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find the difference between the two options:

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we know each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 7 pounds. 

The total amount of hay needed for the goats is 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.
The total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is 75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James takes to swim 60% of the distance.
Distance = 20 miles
Speed = 2 miles per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours
60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 6 hours
Time taken to rest = 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance and time taken to swim the remaining distance.
Remaining distance = 20 - 12 = 8 miles
New speed = 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour
Time taken to swim the remaining distance = 8 / 1 = 8 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time taken to get across the lake.

- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 * $1.2 = $12

Total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We are given that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set these two equations equal to each other to find the relationship between A and D. 

A + 20 = D + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:
A + 10 = D

We are also given that the total points scored by the team is 45. So, A + B + D = 45. 

Substituting B = A + 20 and D = A + 10 into the equation A + B + D = 45, we get:
A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3A + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3A = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
A = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total time in minutes by the number of reports he staples per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

The time she went to sleep is still 10 p.m. 

The time she was sleepwalking is from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept, we need to find the time she went to sleep and the time she woke up. The time she went to sleep is 10 p.m. and the time she woke up is 5:55 a.m.

10 p.m. is 12:00 a.m. + 2 hours = 2:00 a.m. 
5:55 a.m. is 5:00 a.m. + 55 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

The time she was asleep is from 2:00 a.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 3 hours and 55 minutes. 

3 hours * 60 minutes = 180 minutes
3 hours and 55 minutes = 180 + 55 = 235 minutes

The total time she slept is 235 minutes. 

The time she was sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

The total time she slept on her bed is 235 - 23 = 212 minutes.

The final answer is: 212"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we need to convert the number of cups to a numerical value. Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3.

Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) * 24
= (2 * 24) / 3
= 48 / 3
= 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to subtract the number of spoons he gifted from the initial number of spoons.

Total number of utensils remaining = Initial number of spoons - Number of spoons gifted
= 16 - 6
= 10

However, we also need to consider the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has 24 cups and no cups were gifted, the total number of utensils remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the cups.

Total number of utensils remaining = 10 (spoons) + 24 (cups)
= 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds occupied.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is equal to 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we add the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted in 2 weeks to find the total occupied beds.

Total occupied beds = 100 beds + 700 beds = 800 beds

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 beds - 800 beds = 200 beds

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. This is 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 2, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

From point 1, we can find Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's denote the number of people reported by Courtney as C = 48.

20% of C is 0.20 * C = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Since Kelly said Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we subtract 9.6 from the number reported by Courtney to get the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Actual number of people = C - 9.6 = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

We know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. Therefore, the total number of balls is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
= 7 * 1
= 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as x.

At the end of the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
At the end of the second day, they dug 13 more holes, so the total number of holes is 10 + 13 = 23.
At the end of the third day, they dug 8 more holes, but filled in 2, so the total number of holes is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.
The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, which means it had 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the end of the fourth day.
Since we know that there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than the others)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each.

Now, let's find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got x + 15 corn chips, which is 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

"To find the cost of travel, we need to first determine the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400. 

Since the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, we add this to the cost of the supplies:
$400 + $200 = $600

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We are given the following information:
1. A + S + L = 339
2. L = S + 5
3. S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

We can substitute the third equation into the above equation to get:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles in the initial southerly direction, then 36 miles in the northerly direction, and finally 110 miles in the second southerly direction, we need to add the distances traveled in the southerly directions and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

Total southerly distance = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Total distance = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is the decimal equivalent of 75%).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years).

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has:

Let R = Robert's cherries
Let R = R + 10 (since Robert has 10 more than Richard)
30 = R + 10
R = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries. 

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can subtract the total number of cherries that Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries:

Total cherries = 60
Robert's cherries = 30
Richard's cherries = 20
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries = 30
Jerry's cherries = 10

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (Sunday's gingerbread * 6) + (Sunday's apple pie * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let E be Emil's current age, D be his dad's current age, and B be his brother's current age.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D.

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

We can solve for B by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us B = 12.

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages by adding D and B.

1 foot = 12 inches, so 111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Now, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet, which is 24 * 12 = 288 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed: 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we divide the total available space by the width of each plant: 1044 / 12 = 87.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we subtract 17 from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed: 87 - 17 = 70.

Now, we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant: 70 * 6 = 420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket * $2.50 per sweet potato vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers, each needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers. So, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

For the carnations, each needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations. So, the total soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, and 27 pounds are used for sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is 3 / 1 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply $500.00 by 12.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair costs $1,000.00, so we divide $6,000.00 by $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we need to find out how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp. 90 / 30 = 3. This means she needs to cook 3 batches of 30 shrimp each. Since each batch takes 10 minutes, the total cooking time is 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time for peeling and cooking together. So, the total time is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is turned off. Since it was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Then, the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years. So, the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time minus the age of his dad when he saw the comet is 75 years. 

Therefore, 3x - x = 75
2x = 75
x = 37.5

This is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, the time between the two events is 37.5 - 30 = 7.5 years.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. Since the time between the two events is 7.5 years, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can find the number of times the comet has orbited the sun in 7.5 years. 

75 years / 7.5 years = 10

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. 

Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the number of flights made by the first plane is 2 * 44 = 88.

Now, we can equate the total number of flights made by the first plane to 88 and solve for x:
x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:
Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4) * 88

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings:

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Since the total age of the children is 20, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20/4 = 5. 

So, A = 5. 

Helene's age is 2A = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old. Therefore, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate based on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

So, the amount that the lawyer will donate is 3 times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of guests at the wedding by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, we need to find 1/2 of the total cookies.

Cookies given to the church = 1500 cookies * 1/2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we need to divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of people is 6. 

Let's assume each kid gets 'k' slices of the watermelon. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets '2k' slices. 

The total number of slices given to the kids is 4k (4 kids * k slices each), and the total number of slices given to the adults is 2 * 2k = 4k (2 adults * 2k slices each).

The total number of slices given to all the people is 4k + 4k = 8k.

Since the total number of slices of the watermelon is 'x', we can set up the equation: 8k = x.

Now, each adult gets 4k slices, which is half of the total slices given to all the people (8k). 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the total number of slices they get, which is 4k/x. 

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (4k/x) * 100 = (4k/x) * (100/x) = 400k/x^2.

Since 8k = x, we can substitute x with 8k in the equation: 400k/(8k)^2 = 400k/64k^2 = 400/64 = 25/4 = 6.25.

So, each adult gets 6.25% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 6.25"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Each inpatient takes 20 minutes, and there are 9 inpatients.
- Total time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes
- Convert minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes, and there are 10 appointments.
- Total time spent on appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes
- Convert minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Total hours worked by Doctor Jones = 9 hours
Time left to update records = Total hours worked - Total time spent on rounds and appointments
= 9 hours - 8 hours
= 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

The total time required is the sum of the time to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter = 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake = 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake = 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time required = 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start making the cake, we need to subtract the total time required from the serving time.

Latest start time = 5:00 pm - 3 hours
Latest start time = 2:00 pm

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation 8x = 64.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: 
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/day * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total cost per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

However, these babies are not born at the same time, but over the course of a year. To find the total population after a year, we need to add the initial population to the total number of babies born.

Initial population = 50
Total babies born = 1440
Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Male students over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375
4. Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students:
Female students = 1125 + 750 = 1875

The final answer is: 1875"
"To find the number of laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of laps Bethany can run and the number of laps Quinn can run. 

Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 

The difference is 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 5 * 9)%.

After the first 5 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45)%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45 - 3 * 7)%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x - 45 - 3 * 7 = 28

Simplifying the equation:

x - 45 - 21 = 28

Combine like terms:

x - 66 = 28

Add 66 to both sides:

x = 94

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Janet to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far and subtract that from the $10 he has. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost so far: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we divide the number of packs by 10: 13 / 10 = 1.3 packs per friend.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack: 1.3 * 60 = 78.

However, since we cannot divide packs into fractions, we can round down to 1 pack per friend and give the remaining packs to the friends with more than 1 pack. 

So, 13 packs / 10 friends = 1 pack per 7 friends and 1 pack shared between 3 friends. 

1 pack has 60 pieces, so 7 friends received 1 pack each, which is 7 * 60 = 420 pieces. 

The remaining 3 friends received 1 pack shared between them, which is 60 / 3 = 20 pieces each.

Therefore, the friends who received 1 pack each got 420 pieces, and the friends who received a shared pack got 20 pieces each.

The final answer is: 420"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, since 2 albums were portraits only, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is: 
27

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we can multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set: 6 * 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the total number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so the number of average questions is (60 - 24) / 2 = 18, and the number of difficult questions is also 18.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 for each type of question.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: s = 2l.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120. The earnings from the small stuffed animals are $4s and the earnings from the large stuffed animals are $12l. We can write an equation based on the total earnings: 4s + 12l = 120.

Substituting s = 2l from the first equation into the second equation, we get: 4(2l) + 12l = 120. Simplifying this equation, we get 8l + 12l = 120, which is 20l = 120.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 20, we get l = 6. Since s = 2l, we can substitute l = 6 into this equation to get s = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's denote the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches as x.

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio of the number of sandwiches to their respective prices. 

The ratio for the first package is 2 sandwiches to $3, and for the second package is 4 sandwiches to $6. 

We can set up the proportion as follows:

2/3 = 4/6 = 8/x

We can simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying:

2x = 3 * 8
2x = 24

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

1. 40% of the red balloons burst: 
   Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:
   Number of yellow balloons released = 50% of 12 = 0.5 * 12 = 6
   Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

3. 75% of the blue balloons were added:
   Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
   Total number of balloons now = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability of the complement of the event that he won't have to turn it in. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the last scenario is dependent on the first two not happening. So, we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her, which is 60% (100% - 40% extension chance). Then, we multiply this by the chance of the normal teacher coming in (50%) and the chance of Marcus not convincing her (60%). 

The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her is 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3. 

Now, we add the probabilities of the three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 
0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.4 (normal teacher gives extension) + 0.3 (normal teacher doesn't give extension, but Marcus convinces her) = 1.2. However, this is more than 1, which is impossible. This is because we added the probabilities of mutually exclusive events. 

Let's recalculate the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her: 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3. 

Now, we add the probabilities of the three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework, but this time we'll subtract the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her from the total probability of the normal teacher coming in: 
0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.4 (normal teacher gives extension) + (0.5 * 0.6) (normal teacher doesn't give extension, but Marcus convinces her) = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2. However, this is still more than 1.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to first calculate the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Available seats for guests = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small, medium, and large beans. 

Let's start by using the information that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that 1 small bean is equivalent to 1/3 of a medium-sized bean.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 times the number of large beans. If it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, then he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find the number of small beans he can eat. Since 1 small bean is equivalent to 1/3 of a medium-sized bean, the number of small beans he can eat is 3 times the number of medium-sized beans. 

So, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is 3 * 150 = 450. 

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we need to subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings. 

Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = 45 - 9
Net earnings = $36

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, we need to find out the total number of hours she spends. 

Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate her hourly pay after expenses by dividing her net earnings by the total number of hours.

Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = 36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

The final answer is: $2"

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first find out how many soda bottles he can place along the driveway. 

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

Number of bottles = Total width / Spacing between bottles
Number of bottles = 24 / 3
Number of bottles = 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to go to 7 more bottles (8 total bottles - 1 = 7). It will take him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. 

Total time = Number of remaining bottles * Time per bottle
Total time = 7 * 5
Total time = 35

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so his new income is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. 

The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we can calculate the area of one fabric piece: 
Area = length * width
Area = 8 * 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two fabric pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2:
Total area = 2 * 80
Total area = 160 square feet

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

1. The first loss is $5.
2. The second win is $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so it's 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. The third loss is 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so it's 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- First loss: $5
- Second win: $11 (but since it's a win, we consider it as a negative loss, so - $11)
- Third loss: $16.50

Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $10.50

There were 3 races, so the average loss is:
Average loss = Total loss / Number of races = $10.50 / 3 = $3.50

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007, so we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

The initial price of the car is $20,000.

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.

To calculate the depreciation for each year, we can use the formula:

Price after depreciation = Initial price * (1 - depreciation rate)

For 2008:
Price after depreciation = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21) = $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800

For 2009:
Price after depreciation = $15,800 * (1 - 0.21) = $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,502

For 2010:
Price after depreciation = $12,502 * (1 - 0.21) = $12,502 * 0.79 = $9,900.18

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,900.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 * 0.5 = 25.

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of a single tile (1 SqFt).

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
= 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
= 200 tiles

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile.

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
= 200 tiles * $12
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Increased cost = Normal cost + Increased cost
= $120 + $72
= $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the annual cost.

Annual cost = Increased cost * 12
= $192 * 12
= $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since a twin set of sheets is washed at a time, and there are 4 twin beds, he needs to wash 4 sets of twin sheets. Additionally, he needs to wash 1 king set of sheets. So, in total, he needs to wash 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets every week.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, he needs to wash the 4 twin sets of sheets in 4/2 = 2 loads, and the 1 king set of sheets in 1 load. So, in total, he needs to do 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry every week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 * 52 = 156 loads of laundry in a year.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected this year and add it to the total number of stickers he already had.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which was 50. So, this year he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers he collected this year to the total number of stickers he had last year: 150 + 100 = 250.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day (60 grams * 2, since she feeds them twice a day).

First, we calculate the total amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (120 grams): 720 / 120 = 6.

The cat food will last for 6 days."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. There are 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 4 x 8 = 32.
2. Becky ate 10 slices.
3. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
4. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did, so Silvia ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 
10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as (x + 18).

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

John's scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80. 

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The average score is 95."
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 (total pizzas) - 46 (pizzas eaten) = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and there are 700 small coupons, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 0.05 = $3.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and there are 1400 big coupons, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 0.15 = $210.

Now, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons to find the total cost of postage. The total cost is $3.50 + $210 = $213.50.

The final answer is: $213.50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 
   So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, the number of sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3.

4. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. 
   So, the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 + 3 = 6.

5. The total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find the number of trucks that did not have mechanical failures. 

Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery. A quarter of the number of trucks had mechanical failures. 

A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures. 

The number of trucks that did not have mechanical failures is 20 - 5 = 15.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300.

"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to first calculate the total pounds of butter Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter as follows:

- For the first 3 pounds, Dennis will pay full price: 3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00
- For the next 3 pounds, Dennis will get one half off: 3 pounds * $2.00/pound (half of $4.00) = $6.00

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 and then multiply that by the cost per guest. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 people. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are already included in the rental fee, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

The cost per additional guest is $6, so the total cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

Adding the initial rental fee of $125, the total cost of the party is $125 + $126 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60 initially, she now has 3/4 * $60 = $45.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she had $60 initially, she now has 2/3 * $60 = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the amount Maggie has to the amount Riza has: $45 + $40 = $85.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day.

We know that the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315, and this is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas the monkeys eat in a week is 315.

We can set up the equation: 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x = 315

Combine like terms: 56 + 7x = 315

Subtract 56 from both sides: 7x = 259

Divide both sides by 7: x = 37

So, the third monkey eats 37 bananas each day.

"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract those from the total to find out how many pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas
Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30
Total revenue = $162

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul needs to wait for his train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is not given, we assume Paul arrives at the station at time 0. The fourth train arrives at 145 minutes, so Paul needs to wait for 145 minutes.

However, we need to consider the time Paul waits from the time he arrives at the station until the first train arrives. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, so Paul waits for 10 minutes for the first train. 

The total waiting time for Paul is the time he waits for the fourth train minus the time he waits for the first train, which is 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has already saved. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total and she already has 120, she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide 80 by 10, which is 8.

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price he paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount = ((Original Price - Price Paid) / Original Price) * 100
= ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100
= (200 / 2000) * 100
= 0.10 * 100
= 10%

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of jellyfish each spring creates per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we multiply the total seconds by the number of springs:

14400 seconds * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

However, we need to consider that each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, so we should multiply the total number of jellyfish by the number of seconds in a second, which is 1. 

72000 jellyfish * 1 = 72000 jellyfish

"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to twice Binkie's score to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip distance. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the total time taken. 

time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

However, this is the total time taken for the round trip. We need to find the time taken to reach the store initially. Since James walked halfway to the store and then back home, the time taken to reach the store initially is half of the total time taken for the round trip.

Time taken to reach the store initially = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour

"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we need to calculate the cost of 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas each. 

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry have from the total amount of fence. Since Sam has 20 feet and Harry has 20 + 60 = 80 feet, the total amount of fence they have is 20 + 80 = 100 feet. However, the question asks for the amount left over, which is not applicable in this case since they used the entire 100 feet."
"To find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we need to divide the total growth by the number of years. 

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Total years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's find the price of each type of bike:
- MTB: $500
- BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
- Trekking: $450

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB: 105 * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

"To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to determine the net change in the number of bales per hour. 

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. So, the net change per hour is 5 - 3 = 2 bales.

Since they work for 6 hours, the net change in the number of bales is 2 * 6 = 12 bales.

However, since the farmer produces 5 bales per hour and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour, the initial number of bales in the field is not relevant to the calculation. The net change in the number of bales is the key to solving the problem.

Therefore, the number of bales left in the field is the initial number of bales minus the net change, which is not provided. However, we can calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer in 6 hours, which is 5 * 6 = 30 bales. 

Since the truck picks up 3 bales per hour, the total number of bales picked up in 6 hours is 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The number of bales left in the field is the total number of bales produced minus the total number of bales picked up, which is 30 - 18 = 12 bales.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per day. Since he has 6 periods in a day and each class is 40 minutes long, we multiply the number of periods by the duration of each class:

6 periods/day * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes/day

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the daily minutes by the number of days:

240 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1200 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. Since he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days, we first need to find 1/16 of his total weekly minutes. To do this, we need to find his total weekly minutes, which is the sum of his in-class minutes and the extra minutes on Saturday and Sunday. However, since we don't know the extra minutes yet, we'll represent it as x. 

Let's denote the total weekly minutes as T. Then, T = 1200 + x. 

1/16 of T is (1/16) * (1200 + x).

However, we know that 1/16 of T is also equal to the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. Since he spends the same amount of time on both days, we can represent the extra minutes as 2y, where y is the extra minutes per day. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2y = (1/16) * (1200 + x).

Now, we need to find the total minutes he spends learning, which is the sum of his in-class minutes and the extra minutes on Saturday and Sunday. This is equal to 1200 + 2y.

We can substitute 2y from the previous equation into this expression: 1200 + 2y = 1200 + (1/8) * (1200 + x).

To simplify this expression, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. Since 8 is a multiple of 16, we can rewrite (1/16) as (1/8) * (1/2). 

Now, we can rewrite the expression as: 1200 + 2y = 1200 + (1/8) * (1200 + x) = 1200 + (1/2) * (600 + x/8).

To simplify this expression, we can rewrite (1/2) * (600 + x/8) as (1/2) * 600 + (1/2) * (x/8) = 300 + (1/16) * x.

Now, we can rewrite the expression as: 1200 + 2y = 1200 + 300 + (1/16) * x.

Combine like terms: 1200 + 2y = 1500 + (1/16) * x.

Now, we can solve for x. Since 2y = (1/16) * (1200 + x), we can rewrite this as 2y = (1/16) * (1200 + x) = (1/16) * 1200 + (1/16) * x = 75 + (1/16) * x.

Now, we can rewrite the expression 1200 + 2y = 1500 + (1/16) * x as 1200 + 75 + (1/16) * x = 1500 + (1/16) * x.

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, so the height after the first bounce is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each subsequent child.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

Let's start with the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate: 270 kilograms.

Since the Allosaurus ate the last of the meat, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate was twice the amount left after the Allosaurus ate, because the velociraptors ate half of what was left. 

So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate = 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was twice the amount left after the velociraptors ate.

So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate = 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops.

So, the original amount of meat on the triceratops = 2 * 1080 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their area is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their area is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost per gallon is $12, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2: 50 * 0.2 = 10.

So, Billy takes 10 days off. To find the number of days he works, we subtract 10 from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40.

Now, we know Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he helps, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the ceremony.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the remaining people who were not transported by the buses or cars were already inside the church. However, the question does not provide the total number of people who attended the ceremony. 

To find the total number of people who attended the ceremony, we need to know the total number of people who were inside the church and the number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars.

Since Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can find Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
Total time spent in 5 days = 1 hour/day x 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah's distance, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Total distance = 52 miles
Amber's distance = 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles
Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

"Let's break down the information given:

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
3. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
4. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color. This means 2/3 of the large jellyfish do not change color. Since they are all green, we can consider them as part of the small jellyfish group.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. The number of large jellyfish is x/5, and the number of small jellyfish is 4x/5 (since 4/5 of the jellyfish are small).

The number of large jellyfish that change color is 1/3 * (x/5) = x/15. The number of small jellyfish that change color is 6 (given).

Since the total number of jellyfish that change color is the sum of the large and small jellyfish that change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 + 6 = 6

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides:

x/15 = 0

Multiplying both sides by 15:

x = 0

However, this is not possible since there must be at least one jellyfish in the tank. Let's re-examine the equation:

x/15 + 6 = 6

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

x/15 = 0

Multiplying both sides by 15:

x = 0

However, this is not possible since there must be at least one jellyfish in the tank. Let's re-examine the equation again.

We know that the number of small jellyfish that change color is 6. Since the small jellyfish always stay blue, this 6 must be part of the 4/5 of the jellyfish that are small. Let's denote the number of small jellyfish as 4x/5. The number of small jellyfish that change color is 6, so we can set up the equation:

6 = (4/5)x

Multiplying both sides by 5/4:

6 * (5/4) = x

15/2 = x

x = 7.5

However, this is not possible since the number of jellyfish must be a whole number. Let's re-examine the equation again.

We know that the number of small jellyfish that change color is 6. Since the small jellyfish always stay blue, this 6 must be part of the 4/5 of the jellyfish that are small. Let's denote the number of small jellyfish as 4x/5. The number of small jellyfish that change color is 6, so we can set up the equation:

6 = (4/5)x

Multiplying both sides by 5/4:

6 * (5/4) = x

15/2 = x

However, this is not possible since the number of jellyfish must be a whole number. Let's re-examine the equation again.

Let's denote the number of small jellyfish as 4x/5. The number of small jellyfish that change color is 6, so we can set up the equation:

6 = (4/5)x

"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can find Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses during retirement. 40% of her current annual salary is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses during retirement will be 20 * $40,000 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate her annual savings. She saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save for her retirement, we need to divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings. 

Total amount needed = $800,000
Annual savings = $20,000

Number of years = Total amount needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has a retirement period of 20 years, we need to subtract this from the total number of years.

Number of years needed to work = Total number of years - Retirement period
= 40 - 20
= 20 years

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the discount.

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4 inch heels and 3 wearing 2 inch heels).

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height of all the heels divided by the total number of women, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has for hiking in June. June has 30 days. 

Since she will be hiking twice a day, the total number of hiking days is 30 * 2 = 60 days.

She wants to hike a total of 9,300 miles in 60 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the total number of days: 9,300 / 60 = 155 miles per day.

Since she is already hiking 125 miles twice a day, the total miles she is hiking per day is 125 * 2 = 250 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we subtract the miles she is already hiking from the miles she needs to hike: 155 - 250 = -95 miles per day.

However, since the result is negative, it means she is currently hiking more than the required amount per day. To find out how many fewer miles per day she needs to hike, we take the absolute value of the result: |-95| = 95 miles per day.

So, Soledad must hike 95 miles fewer per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, each costing $9, so the total revenue from red balls is 3 x $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, each costing $5, so the total revenue from blue balls is 11 x $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, each costing $3, so the total revenue from green balls is 25 x $3 = $75.

Now, we add the revenue from each color of ball together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since there are three people (Pierre, Paul, and Jacques), and we are assuming the question is referring to Jacques as James, we need to find out how much Jacques will take. However, the question does not mention Jacques wanting any apples. 

Given the information, we can assume Jacques is the remaining person and will take the rest of the apples. 

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg of apples left.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had initially, including the money he saved.

Initially, Raymond had $21. He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had: $32 - $24 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much money Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now that we know the rate per minute, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip and multiply it by 2. 

The distance of a one-way trip can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Given that the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, the distance of a one-way trip is:
distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since John makes a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
total distance = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

However, John visits his parents twice a month. To find the total distance driven in a month, we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
total monthly distance = 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to find out how far Brian will walk. Let's represent the distance Brian walks as 'x'. The equation will be:

2x = 70 miles

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 2.

x = 70 miles / 2
x = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers:

200 toys (from the first 4 workers) + 20 toys (from the fifth worker) = 220 toys (from the first 4 workers) + 160 toys (from the fifth worker) = 380 toys

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour as follows:

160 toys / 10 hours = 16 toys/hour

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris also kept 9 stickers, so Kris had a total of 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Before giving some to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers. Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth, so Luis must have had an even number of stickers. This means that Seth gave Luis an even number of stickers.

Let's call the number of stickers Seth gave to Luis ""x"". Since Luis used half of the stickers, he had x stickers left. We know that Luis had 16 stickers before giving some to Kris, so x + x/2 = 16.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get 2x + x = 32, which simplifies to 3x = 32. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 32/3. However, this is not possible since x must be an even number.

Let's try a different approach. If Luis used half of the stickers, then he must have had an even number of stickers. Let's call the number of stickers Seth gave to Luis ""x"". Luis used x/2 stickers, so he had x - x/2 = x/2 stickers left. We know that Luis had 16 stickers before giving some to Kris, so x/2 = 16.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 32. This means that Seth gave 32 stickers to Luis.

Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth must have had 2x = 2(32) = 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to first find the total weight of the M&M's. Since John buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

To find the number of small bags, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag. Since each small bag has 10 M&M's, the number of small bags is 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

"To find Vince's current age, we first need to find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since we want to find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 to his age two years ago: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the second equation as C = S + 12 and substitute it into the first equation: (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C: C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and A + M + C + S = 56, we can substitute the values of C and S: A + M + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: A + M + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: A + M = 26.

Since A = M, we can substitute A with M: M + M = 26.

Combine like terms: 2M = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: M = 13.

Now that we know M, we can find A: A = M = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the total number of boxes is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

The total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 ounce = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 ounces = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

Number of logs = 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks is:

Total planks = 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total amount he makes is:

Total amount = 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. We can use the formula time = distance/speed to find the time spent on the sidewalk.

Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 2/x minutes
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 mile / 2x miles/minute = 1/(2x) minutes

Since the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation 2/x = 40. Solving for x, we get x = 1/20 miles/minute.

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk. Time spent on the sidewalk = 1/(2x) = 1/(2 * 1/20) = 1/0.1 = 10 minutes.

The total time spent on the entire walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 by dividing 28 by 4. 

28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we add the number of blue birds in each group together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the initial number of marbles Bob has be x.

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have x + 2 * 12 = x + 24 marbles.

We are given that after receiving 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 24 = 60

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 36

This means Bob initially has 36 marbles.

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows (initial) + 420 cows (added) = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens (initial) + 210 chickens (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, we first need to calculate the original price of 4 packs of bagels. 

The original price of 1 pack of bagels is $10.00. 
The original price of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
The discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs. 
Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels. 
The cost of each single bagel is $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make this, so we can write this as:

Potatoes per scoop = 6 - 3
Potatoes per scoop = 3

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Total potatoes = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Total potatoes = 18 * 3
Total potatoes = 54

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We are given that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * Number of green jellybeans
Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17
Number of red jellybeans = 34

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans.

Total green and red jellybeans = Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans
Total green and red jellybeans = 17 + 34
Total green and red jellybeans = 51

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - Total green and red jellybeans
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10 (since a decade has 10 years).

First, let's find the total number of lemons Tim collects in one year:

Number of trees: 5
Lemons per tree per year: 6

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, let's find the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade:

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

"Let's break down the information given:

- The cost of a sunflower is $2.
- The cost of a bouquet is $8, which contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sells per day. Since he earns $26 from sunflowers per day and each sunflower costs $2, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day as follows:

Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers per day / Cost of a sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13 sunflowers per day

Next, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sells per day. Since he earns $56 from bouquets per day and each bouquet costs $8, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day as follows:

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets per day / Cost of a bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day is:

Total sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = Number of bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
= 7 * 12
= 84 sunflowers per day

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold per day, including both individual sunflowers and those in bouquets:

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold per day + Total sunflowers in bouquets sold per day
= 13 + 84
= 97 sunflowers per day

Finally, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days:

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * Number of days
= 97 * 3
= 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the inventory, the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the cost and revenue.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. 

Cost per rock = $5
Total money = $100
Number of rocks = Total money / Cost per rock
Number of rocks = 100 / 5
Number of rocks = 20

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the inventory.

Total cost = Number of rocks * Cost per rock
Total cost = 20 * 5
Total cost = $100

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks.

Number of rocks sold = 20 * 0.6
Number of rocks sold = 12

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

Revenue per rock = $7
Revenue = Number of rocks sold * Revenue per rock
Revenue = 12 * 7
Revenue = $84

Now, let's find the loss.

Loss = Total cost - Revenue
Loss = 100 - 84
Loss = $16

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The day count for each type of scene is not the same, so we need to find the maximum day count among them. The maximum day count is 9 days for large-sized picture scenes.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to create all of the picture scenes.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C. Then, Jim collected C + 5 seashells.

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Then, Carlos collected 2R seashells.

Since Jim collected C + 5 seashells and Carlos collected 2R seashells, and we know Jim collected 27 seashells, we can equate C + 5 to 27 and solve for C:
   C + 5 = 27
   C = 22

Now we know Carlos collected 22 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, we can equate 2R to 22 and solve for R:
   2R = 22
   R = 11

Now we know Carrey collected 11 seashells. We also know Jim collected 27 seashells, and Carlos collected 22 seashells. 

The total number of seashells collected is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.

They decided to divide the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3:
   60 / 3 = 20

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100/20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required:

11500 - 4200 = 7300

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So far, he has sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. This leaves him with 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

6. To find the total number of eggs found, we add the number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now we know the total number of apartments is 640. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 640 * 3 = 1920 apartments per week.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4: The tree is 8 years old, but the problem doesn't give us the amount of fruits it produces directly. However, it tells us that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Year 5: The tree is 9 years old, but the problem states that it doesn't produce any fruits in the ninth year.
- Year 6: The tree is 10 years old, and it produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 1350

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We can express R in terms of Y: R = 4(Y - 7).

We are also given that R + B + Y = 37. 

Substituting R = 4(Y - 7) and B = Y - 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get:
4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37

Combine like terms:
4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37

Combine like terms:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, we can isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Next, we can add 5y to both sides to get:

3x = 5y

Now, we can divide both sides by 5 to solve for y:

y = (3/5)x

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression for Ronnie's remaining money:

Ronnie's remaining money = x - y
= x - (3/5)x
= (2/5)x

We are given that Ronnie was given $5 initially, so we can substitute x = 5 into the expression:

Ronnie's remaining money = (2/5)(5)
= 2

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is a combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The other half of the mural is a combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can set up the equation:

6 (yellow) + 3x (red, white, and purple) = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 6

Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x = 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to get the total area of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The final answer is: 93"
"To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost of the box and then divide the result by the cost per cycle ($1).

Number of cycles per dollar = Number of pods / Cost of the box
= 120 / 12
= 10

Now, we need to divide the result by the cost per cycle ($1) to find the number of cycles we can run for $1.

Number of cycles for $1 = Number of cycles per dollar / Cost per cycle
= 10 / 1
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the total number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is $20, tripling his money means each bill is now worth $60. So, he now has 20 * 60 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount by 5: 1200 / 5 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. 

Now, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

So, in the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. 

So, the remaining chalk after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days the 2.75 inches of chalk will last at a rate of 20% usage per day.

Let's set up an equation to find the number of days (x) the chalk will last:

2.75 = 5 * (1 - 0.20)^x

We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 5:

0.55 = (0.80)^x

To solve for x, we can take the logarithm of both sides:

log(0.55) = x * log(0.80)

Now, we can divide both sides by log(0.80):

x = log(0.55) / log(0.80)

Using a calculator, we get:

x ≈ 4.32

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk, so we round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 24 students in total (12 boys and 12 girls), the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, and then calculate three times that amount and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Three times the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.

Johnny bought 2 more than three times as many as Mike, so Johnny bought 15 + 2 = 17 face masks.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11. 

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15. 

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total amount of milk sold. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons is (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500). 

Total number of books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Number of books per school = 54 / 3
Number of books per school = 18

2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples.
3. He picked up the 5 new apples and put all but 1 in his pocket. So, he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 1 new apple.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 6 new apples.

To find the total number of apples he brought home, we add the apples in his pocket and the new apples: 1 (in pocket) + 6 (new apples) = 7.

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas of each type Kate needs to buy to meet the demand.

For cheese pizza, Kate needs to buy 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

For pepperoni pizza, Kate needs to buy 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

The total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6."
"To find the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the total miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and add it to the total miles run on Tuesday and Thursday.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since there are 3 days, the total miles run on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. Since there are 2 days, the total miles run on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the total miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the total miles run on Tuesday and Thursday: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2/(15/60) = 4 snowballs per hour. 

The net rate at which Jay is building snowballs is 1/3 - 4 = -13/3 snowballs per hour. 

Since Jay is losing snowballs, we need to find the time it takes for him to have 60 snowballs. Let's assume it takes x hours to have 60 snowballs. 

The equation becomes: 20x - 4x = 60 

Combine like terms: 16x = 60 

Divide both sides by 16: x = 60/16

The equation becomes: 20x - 4x = 60 

Combine like terms: 16x = 60 

Divide both sides by 16: x = 60/16 

x = 3.75 hours 

Since Jay loses 4 snowballs every hour, we need to find the time it takes for him to lose 4 snowballs. 

The equation becomes: 4x = 4 

Divide both sides by 4: x = 1 

Since x is the time it takes for Jay to lose 4 snowballs, we need to add this time to x to find the total time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs. 

Total time = x + x = 3.75 + 1 = 4.75 hours 

However, this is the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs without considering the initial snowballs he had. 

Let's assume Jay starts with 0 snowballs. 

The equation becomes: 20x - 4x = 60 

Combine like terms: 16x = 60 

Divide both sides by 16: x = 60/16

"To find Jim's age, we need to first find John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, 20 years ago he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, Jim's age 20 years ago was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Doxa ate 1 slice of apple. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each of them ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices they ate is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages added. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

The initial number of bandages is 21."
"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length cut off is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total regular pay is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Since she has complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for each day she works. There are 6 days in a week, and she works 4 weeks, so she works a total of:
6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days

Her attendance bonus is:
24 days * $10/day = $240

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
$270 (regular pay) + $240 (attendance bonus) = $510

The final answer is: $510"

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them up.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 
Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 
Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens separately and then add them together.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, so the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of the red pens and the black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 90 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the amount of root beer available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is:
24 - 4 = 20 gallons

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is:
20 - 7 = 13 gallons

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is:
13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find the amount each person got, we divide the remaining amount by 3:
8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons

So, each person got approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be translated into the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.

This simplifies to: 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4.

x = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

Number of fish with red stripes = (1/3) * 66 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. 

Number of fish without red stripes = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22
= 44

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish. 

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * 44
= (5/11) * (4 * 11)
= 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 

Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes
= 22 + 20
= 42

"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had and then subtract the ones she lost or used up.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

In total, Amy lost 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we subtract the ones she lost from the total: 26 - 7 = 19.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison's height: 60 inches
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison: 7 * 60 = 420 inches
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison: 3 * 60 = 180 inches

Since the total height of the two-story house is 420 inches, and the first floor's height is 180 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is equal to the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches."
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)

"To find the total miles walked by the first three dogs, we need to add their individual miles. 

Dog 1 walks 1 mile, 
Dog 2 walks 4 miles, 
Dog 3 walks 3 miles.

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, we can find the total miles walked by all dogs by multiplying the average miles per dog by the total number of dogs.

Total miles walked by all dogs = Average miles per dog * Total number of dogs
Total miles walked by all dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles walked by all dogs = 12 miles.

Now, we can find the miles walked by the last dog by subtracting the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all dogs.

Miles walked by the last dog = Total miles walked by all dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles walked by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles walked by the last dog = 4

"To find out how much money John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means John paid off $60,000 of his debt. To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract this amount from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debt.

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = Cost price * (11/8)
Selling price = $72 * (11/8)
Selling price = $72 * 1.375
Selling price = $98.80

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = $98.80 - $72
Profit = $26.80

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to first calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount paid in the first 11 months: 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

However, this is not the total amount he will pay in the twelfth month. We also need to add the $25 he would have paid in the twelfth month if he had paid $25 per month for 12 months. 

So, the total amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 31 + 25 = $56.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height of the jar is 15 inches, so the volume is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume of the jar that can be occupied by jelly beans is 0.8 * 540 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 0.3 * 2880 = 864.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the difference between his estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number.

Since we don't have Tim's guess, we can't calculate the exact difference. However, we can calculate the percentage difference between the true number and the maximum possible number of red jelly beans (which is the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar).

The percentage difference is ((true number - maximum possible number) / maximum possible number) * 100
= ((900 - 864) / 864) * 100
= (36 / 864) * 100
= 4.17%

Since we don't have Tim's guess, we can't calculate the exact difference. However, we can say that his guess was at most 4.17% off from the true number of red jelly beans."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:
4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:
4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:
C = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted manicure and pedicure cost and the nail art cost, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final numerical answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines every year."
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, the number of paintings Shelley has is x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so the number of paintings Samantha has is (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 8 - 12 = 27
x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given steps:

1. The initial price of the toy in November is $40.
2. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).
   New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72.
3. In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).
   New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons at this rate, so the total amount from veteran lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the total amount from standard lessons and veteran lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum of the scores by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine what 1/4 of the original amount is. 

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. 

1/4 of 20 is calculated as: 20 * (1/4) = 20 * 0.25 = 5

This means Eve was left with 5 pieces of pomelos. 

Since Eve originally had 20 pieces, the number of pomelos she gave away is the difference between the original amount and the amount she was left with: 20 - 5 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and to find the whole, we multiply by 4/3).

Let's denote the total number of novels written this year as 'x'. We know that 3/4 of x is equal to 9 novels. 

We can set up the equation: (3/4)x = 9

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. 

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in that time. 

First, we need to find the total hours in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can multiply the average speed by the total hours to find the total distance traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance and multiplying by 100:
Percentage = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.
5. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.
6. The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother, which is 6 + 30 + 36 = 72 grapes.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of ingredients per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 (weekly cost) * 52 (weeks in a year) = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. To find the total number of minutes they have to clean, we multiply the number of days by the number of hours they work per day and then multiply that by 60 to convert hours to minutes. 

5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours
40 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 2400 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by the number of minutes it takes to clean one classroom to find the total number of classrooms they can clean in that time. 

2400 minutes / 15 minutes/classroom = 160 classrooms

Since they have to clean 80 classrooms, they will not be able to clean all of them in the given time. However, we can still find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the number of classrooms they can clean by the total number of classrooms and then multiplying by 100.

(160 classrooms / 80 classrooms) * 100 = 200%

However, this is not the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, but rather the percentage of classrooms they can clean. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to divide the number of classrooms they can clean by the total number of classrooms they can clean in a day.

The custodian works 8 hours a day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes. 

(160 classrooms / 480 minutes) * 100 = 33.33%

The custodian can clean 160 classrooms in 480 minutes, but they have to clean 80 classrooms. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to divide the number of classrooms they have to clean by the number of classrooms they can clean in a day.

(80 classrooms / 160 classrooms) * 100 = 50%

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelves can hold as x. Since there are two middle shelves, the total number of books they can hold is 2x.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2x books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

The total number of books that all three shelves can hold is 2x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 6x - 5.

We are given that Elly has 110 books, so we can set up the equation 6x - 5 = 110 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get:
6x - 5 = 110
6x = 115
x = 115 / 6
x = 19.17 (round down to 19 since we can't have a fraction of a book)

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of books that all three shelves can hold:
6x - 5 = 6(19) - 5 = 113

Since 113 is less than 110, we need to add another bookcase. The total number of books that two bookcases can hold is 113 + 113 = 226, which is still less than 110. We need to add another bookcase. The total number of books that three bookcases can hold is 113 + 113 + 113 = 339, which is greater than 110.

Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost price and the total selling price of the eggs.

First, let's find the total cost price. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and one dozen is 12 eggs, she bought a total of 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

The cost price per dozen is $2.40, so the total cost price for 5 dozens is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's find the total selling price. Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. To find the selling price per egg, we divide $1 by 3, which is $1/3 per egg. 

The total selling price for 60 eggs is 60 * ($1/3) = $20.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost price from the total selling price: $20 - $12 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original cost of the bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Cost after discount: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the cost after discount to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:
$15.00 = 1500 cents

Now, we need to find the cost of each stick of jerky. There are 30 sticks in a bag.
Cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to determine the total number of questions she needs to get right overall to pass. 

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions on both tests, we need to calculate the total number of questions first. The first test has 70 questions and the second test has 40 questions, so the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110.

Now, we can calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to get right to pass. 70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77.

Next, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass. 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Then, he found 3 more marbles, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, not a marble. So, he got rid of 1 marble, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn his bonus.
2. For every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of them have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together to get the total number of candles and flashlights.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40

The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade and 1 extra gallon, he will need to make a total of 5 gallons. 

Since 1 cup of lemon juice is required for 1 gallon of lemonade, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total amount of lemons needed for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

For 5 gallons, we need 5 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can find the total number of lemons needed by multiplying 5 cups by 6 lemons per cup.

Total lemons needed = 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons

However, we also need to consider the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. 

So, the total amount of lemons needed for the extra gallon is 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

To find the total number of lemons needed, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons of regular lemonade and the extra gallon of lemonade.

Total lemons needed = 30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, the total consumption of German Shepherds per day is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, the total consumption of Bulldogs per day is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption of both breeds is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

"To find the distance Elvis traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles. 

To find the distance Elvis traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. The difference is 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

We know that the total number of candies is 232. We can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

Force = 1% * Total weight
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means that the price of one T-shirt is 100% and the price of the other T-shirt is 50% of the original price. 

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, the price of the first T-shirt is $8 and the price of the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. 

The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40 and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 40% of $40 is 0.4 * $40 = $16.

The discounted price of the shoes is the original price minus the discount: $40 - $16 = $24.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa would run 1 mile in 2x minutes. 

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa, we can set up the equation: x * 2 = 16, where x is the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile. Solving for x, we get x = 8 minutes.

Now, we know that Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x minutes, which is 2 * 8 = 16 minutes. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, the total time she took to complete her part of the race is 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line required

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how many feet of line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

600 feet of line required - 6 feet of line already owned = 594 feet of line needed to buy

The final answer is: 594"
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Daily revenue = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily revenue = $10 + $5
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:
Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $15 * 2
Weekly revenue = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of watermelons. 

Cost of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of each watermelon. The profit is 25% of the cost price.

Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit = $0.40

Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price + Profit
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2.00

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years, we can find Dora's current age by subtracting 3 from 12. 

Dora's current age = 12 - 3 = 9

Since James is twice as old as Dora, we can find James' current age by multiplying Dora's current age by 2.

James' current age = 2 * 9 = 18

Now, we know that James is 9 years older than John, since John had James when he was 19. 

John's current age = James' current age - 9 = 18 - 9 = 9

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so we can find the current age of John's youngest son by subtracting John's age at the time of birth from John's current age.

John's youngest son's current age = John's current age - (John's age at birth of youngest son) = 9 - (32 - 19) = 9 - 13 = -4 

However, since age cannot be negative, this is an error in the problem.  We will assume that the problem meant to say that John was 32 when his youngest son was born, and that John was 19 when James was born.  Therefore, the age difference between John and James is 32 - 19 = 13 years.  The age difference between John and his youngest son is 32 - 19 = 13 years.  Since James is 9 years older than John, the age difference between James and John's youngest son is 9 - 13 = -4 years.  However, since age cannot be negative, this is an error in the problem.  We will assume that the problem meant to say that the age difference between James and John's youngest son is 9 years.  Therefore, John's youngest son is 13 - 9 = 4 years younger than James.

Since James is 18, John's youngest son is 18 - 4 = 14 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 14 + 3 = 17 years old.

The final answer is: 17"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference between the two.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference between the number of oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.2:

$400 * 0.2 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so we multiply $50 by 3:

$50 * 3 = $150

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost:

$80 + $150 = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Number of people = 4

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have.

Slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
