"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9. 

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts of white fiber, we need to calculate half of 2 bolts of blue fiber. 

Half of 2 bolts is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

So, the total number of bolts of white fiber is 1 bolt.

Now, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber: 
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we first need to find the total value of the house after repairs. 

The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh puts in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = 1.5x

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 1.5x

Divide both sides by 1.5: 
x = 86,667

So the total value of the house after repairs is $86,667. 

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost from the total value after repairs: 
Profit = Total value after repairs - Original cost
Profit = 86,667 - 80,000
Profit = 6,667

The final answer is: $6,667"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs in a week by the distance of each sprint.

First, we find the total number of sprints James runs in a week: 
3 sprints/week * 3 times/week = 9 sprints/week

Then, we multiply the total number of sprints by the distance of each sprint:
9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total cups of feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal, we first need to find the total cups of feed she has given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed. 
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. 

Total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 20 chickens, the total cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Since Wendi has already given 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, she needs to give the remaining cups of feed in the final meal. 

Total cups of feed needed per meal - Total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon = 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The remaining glasses are 16 - 1 = 15 glasses. 
Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, the cost of the remaining glasses is 15 * (5 * 0.6) = 45 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses: 5 + 45 = 50 dollars.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total download time, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the file in two parts: the first part before the restart and the second part after the restart.

First, let's find the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Then, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The remaining 60% of the file is 120 GB.
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it takes to restart Windows. 

Total time = 40 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

2. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Distance = Speed * Time
Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

3. Distance traveled in the next 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

4. Distance traveled in the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Initial distance from home = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 135 miles
Distance from home at the end of the 4 hours = 180 - 135
Distance from home at the end of the 4 hours = 45 miles

The final answer is: 45"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and overtime pay separately.

Regular pay: 
- Regular hours worked: 40 hours
- Regular rate per hour: $10
- Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Overtime pay:
- Overtime hours worked: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
- Overtime rate per hour: 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour
- Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Total earnings = $400 + $60
Total earnings = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

First month: 60 downloads
Second month: 3 times the downloads in the first month = 3 * 60 = 180 downloads
Third month: 30% reduction from the second month = 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - (0.3 * 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the break-even point, which is the point at which the total cost equals the total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

The total cost of planting the tree is $90, which is a one-time cost. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3 per year. So, the total cost for 'x' years is 90 + 3x.

The tree grows 7 lemons per year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. So, the total revenue for 'x' years is 7 * 1.5 * x = 10.5x.

To find the break-even point, we set the total cost equal to the total revenue and solve for 'x':

90 + 3x = 10.5x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

90 = 7.5x

Divide both sides by 7.5:

x = 90 / 7.5
x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

She had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners.

Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = 5

Combine like terms:

2x/3 - x/3 = 5 + 2 - 1
x/3 = 6

Multiply both sides by 3:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance and then subtract that from the total number of students to find the remaining students. 

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

Now, subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find the remaining students:
20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Now, subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the increase in value of each item. 

For the jewelry, the increase in value is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * 5000 = $125. 

For the electronic gadgets, the increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * 8000 = $96.

Since the merchant is looking to maximize profit, we need to choose the item with the higher increase in value. The jewelry has a higher increase in value of $125 compared to $96 for the electronic gadgets.

The profit would be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, the distance covered by each train is the same, which is 80 miles.

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, the distance covered by each train is the same, which is 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered on the first and second days:

Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the second day
Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
Earnings from teaching = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked per week * Number of weeks worked per year
Earnings from teaching = $20 * 35 * 50
Earnings from teaching = $20 * 1750
Earnings from teaching = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
Earnings from coaching = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked per week * Number of weeks worked per year
Earnings from coaching = $30 * 15 * 50
Earnings from coaching = $30 * 750
Earnings from coaching = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
Annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
Annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500
Annual salary = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Marissa has available to complete the hike and the total distance she has left to cover.

Marissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. 

The total time she has available to complete the hike is the total distance divided by the desired average speed. The total distance is 12 miles, and the desired average speed is 4 miles per hour. 

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters = (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters (approximately)

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is not water. So, the amount of non-water in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters = (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water left is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are mixing the drinks to get a total of 24 liters. Since the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters, and we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of the orange drink left is 10 - 1 = 9 liters, and the amount of the pineapple drink left is 15 - 9 = 6 liters.

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of the orange drink is 6.67 * (9/10) = 6.003 liters (approximately).

The amount of water in the remaining 6 liters of the pineapple drink is 9 * (6/15) = 3.6 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 6.003 + 3.6 = 9.603 liters.

The final answer is: 9.6"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find out how old Raymond is now and then subtract the age at which he had his son.

Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had his son at the age of 23, so we need to find out how many years have passed since then. To do this, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

First 3 customers: 1 DVD each = 3 DVDs
Next 2 customers: 2 DVDs each = 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs

Total DVDs sold to the first 5 customers = 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs

Since the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, we don't need to add anything to the total.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find the total time the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the total hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to use the formula:

Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)

Given:
Discounted Price = $19.50
Discount Percentage = 25% = 0.25

Plugging in the values, we get:

Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (60 days * 1 serving per day = 60 servings).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find the distance traveled between the first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

The first stop was after 20 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 from 60. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the first stop was at 20 miles, and the second stop was 45 miles from the end of the trip. To find the distance between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop from the total distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

However, we can also find the distance between the two stops by subtracting the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip from the total distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance between the two stops = 45 - 40 = 5 miles

Alternatively, we can also find the distance between the two stops by subtracting the distance from the first stop to the second stop from the total distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 20 - (20 + 15) = 20 - 35 = -15 miles (this is incorrect, as distance cannot be negative)
Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 20 - 15 = 5 miles

The correct way to find the distance between the two stops is to find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and subtract it from the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as B, the cost of the first pair of heels as H1, and the cost of the second pair of heels as H2. 

We are given that H1 = $33 and H2 = 2 * H1 = 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that H1 + H2 = B - 5. 

Substituting the values of H1 and H2 into the equation, we get:
33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine like terms:
99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
99 + 5 = B
B = 104

The boots cost $104."
"Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a constant. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time spent on each dog: 0.5 hours

Total time spent in a day = Number of dogs * Time spent on each dog
Total time spent in a day = 10 * 0.5
Total time spent in a day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time spent in a day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time spent in a week = Total time spent in a day * 7
Total time spent in a week = 5 * 7
Total time spent in a week = 35 hours

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110: S + G = 110
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins: G = S + 30

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for S:

S + (S + 30) = 110
Combine like terms:
2S + 30 = 110
Subtract 30 from both sides:
2S = 80
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 40

Now that we know S, we can find G:
G = S + 30
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
3. Raymond has 40 jewels.

From point 2, we can find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25

From point 1, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the points he scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25 (which is the decimal form of 25%): 
4 * 0.25 = 1

Now, we add the 25% more points to the original 4 points:
4 + 1 = 5

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 5 points.

Now, we add the points from both periods to find the total points:
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how much he spends per day. 

Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day and they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out the cost of 2 yogurts. 

To do this, we can divide the total cost of 4 yogurts ($5.00) by 4 to get the cost of 1 yogurt, and then multiply that by 2 to get the cost of 2 yogurts.

Cost of 1 yogurt = $5.00 / 4 = $1.25
Cost of 2 yogurts = $1.25 * 2 = $2.50

Now that we know Terry spends $2.50 per day on yogurt, we can multiply this by 30 to find out how much he spends over 30 days.

Total cost over 30 days = $2.50 * 30 = $75.00

"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money he has.

1. Calculate the total money John made from selling the Lego sets:
   Number of Lego sets = 13
   Price per Lego set = $15
   Total money made = Number of Lego sets * Price per Lego set
   Total money made = 13 * 15
   Total money made = $195

2. Calculate the total cost of the video games:
   Number of video games = 8
   Price per video game = $20
   Total cost of video games = Number of video games * Price per video game
   Total cost of video games = 8 * 20
   Total cost of video games = $160

3. Calculate the total money John spent on video games and the remaining money he has:
   Total money spent = Total cost of video games
   Total money spent = $160
   Remaining money = Total money made - Total money spent
   Remaining money = $195 - $160
   Remaining money = $35

4. Since John has $5 left after buying the video games, we need to subtract the remaining money from the total money made to find out how much he spent on video games and other things:
   Money spent on other things = Total money made - Remaining money
   Money spent on other things = $195 - $35
   Money spent on other things = $160

"To find John's speed, we first need to find the total time he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours the first day, and half of that (1.5 hours) on the other two days. So, the total time he runs in a week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since he runs 60 miles in a week, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. 

Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
- She can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run, so her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
- She can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk, so her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she has 6 hours, she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance = Speed * Time. 

Distance running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to subtract the dragon's reach from the total distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

1200 - 1000 = 200

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, we need to find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 
40 - 14 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of the chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since the 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still consume by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300g = 240g.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the cost per candle. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 and Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, the cost per candle is:

$10.00 / 10 candles = $1.00 per candle

Now, let's find the total cost of making 20 candles:

20 candles * $1.00 per candle = $20.00

Next, let's find the total revenue from selling 20 candles:

20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Now, let's find the net profit:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
So, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Candice started with 80 post-it notes.
2. She placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, so she used 220 post-it notes at work.
3. After using 220 post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.
4. To find out how many post-it notes she had after purchasing the package, we need to add the remaining post-it notes to the ones she used at work: 220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243 post-it notes.
5. Since she started with 80 post-it notes, the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased is the difference between the total post-it notes she had after purchasing the package and the ones she started with: 243 (total after purchasing) - 80 (initial) = 163 post-it notes.

The final answer is: 163"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. 
   Let's say the number of blue ties is x. Then the number of red ties is 2x.

2. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. 
   Since blue ties cost $40 each, red ties cost 40 + (50% of 40) = 40 + 20 = $60 each.

3. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.
   Number of blue ties = Total cost / Cost per tie = 200 / 40 = 5

4. Since the number of blue ties is 5, the number of red ties is 2x = 2 * 5 = 10.

5. Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie = 10 * 60 = $600

6. Total amount spent on ties = Cost of blue ties + Cost of red ties = 200 + 600 = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire (in inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to find 3/4 of the total number of units in the building. 

First, let's find the total number of units in the building. There are 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. 

Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Now, let's find 3/4 of the total number of units. 

3/4 of 120 = (3/4) * 120 = 0.75 * 120 = 90 units

So, the total number of occupied units is 90. 

To find the total number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
= 120 - 90
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd produces per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs per week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs * $2 per dozen = 147 * 2 = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom's ship takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey separately.

First, let's find the time taken for the first leg of the journey (from 1 to 4 PM). Since the time is given in a 12-hour format, we can assume that the time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours.

Now, let's find the distance traveled during this time. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the time taken for the return journey. 
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The total time taken for the round trip is the sum of the time taken for each leg of the journey. 
Total Time = 3 hours + 5 hours
Total Time = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removes. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

Thursday: 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Friday: 
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 * $60 = $0
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is: $520 - $480 = $40"

20% of 25 = (20/100) * 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
5 (unripe) + 1 (bad) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total oranges) - 6 (not good oranges) = 19 oranges are good.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler, then add the insurance cost.

Cost of material: $500
Cost of jeweler: $800
Total cost before insurance: $500 + $800 = $1300

Insurance cost is 10% of the total cost before insurance: 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130

Total amount Janet paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430

"To find the annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total value of the pension after 20 years and then add the 5% increase for the remaining 10 years.

The total value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

The 5% increase is 5% of the total value of the pension after 20 years, which is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.

The annual pension after 30 years will be the original $50,000/year plus the 5% increase, which is $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000.

The final answer is: $100,000."
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, so the amount she paid for the first half is:
$140 * 6 = $840

The second half of the year is also 6 months, but she gets a 10% discount, so the amount she paid for the second half is:
$140 * 0.9 = $126 (10% discount is 10% of $140, which is $14, so $140 - $14 = $126)
$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts for the first and second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) of her car. We can do this by dividing the distance she traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used to fill up (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gallons = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 mpg

Now that we know the mpg, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the mpg by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons).

Total distance = mpg * tank capacity = 25 mpg * 12 gallons = 300 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are twice as many boys as girls, so the number of boys is 2 times the number of girls.
   Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
   Number of boys = 2 * 60
   Number of boys = 120

2. The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls.
   Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
   Total number of students = 120 + 60
   Total number of students = 180

3. There are 5 students to every teacher, so to find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5.
   Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
   Number of teachers = 180 / 5
   Number of teachers = 36

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the amount of money Bailey starts with.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100, which is the sum of the money she started with (x) and the allowance she received ($40).

We can write the equation as: x + 40 = 100

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60. 

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the price per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes a day for 5 weekdays, so she teaches 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays.
She teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
Total classes in a week = 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week = 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week = 495 * 15 = $7455.

"To find the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total interest and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for one cell phone:
Interest per cell phone = 2% of $150 = 0.02 * $150 = $3

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total interest for all cell phones = $3 * 5 = $15

Now, let's calculate the total amount Shiela will pay for all 5 cell phones:
Total amount = Cost of 5 cell phones + Total interest
Total amount = $150 * 5 + $15
Total amount = $750 + $15
Total amount = $765

Since the installment is for 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3:
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $765 / 3
Monthly payment = $255

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can find the square footage of the other levels by dividing the previous level's square footage by 2.

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels to find the total square footage:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels in the sandcastle. To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

First, let's find the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days: 
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Since the puppy will eat 2 cups/day for the rest of its life, we need to find the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year. 
365 - 180 = 185 days left in the year

Now, let's find the number of cups the puppy will eat in the remaining days:
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, let's add the cups eaten in the first 180 days and the remaining days:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the total number of bags by dividing the total cups by the cups per bag:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

From point 2, we can find out how much laundry David does:
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

From point 1, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does:
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is:
$2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers * $0.50 per flower = $9

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive price:
Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we need to find the closest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 18, which is 18. 
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

Now, we need to find the remaining flowers:
18 flowers - 6 packages * 3 flowers per package = 0 flowers
Since there are no remaining flowers, we don't need to buy any additional packages.

The cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive price is $15.

To find the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we subtract the cost of the better price from the cost of the more expensive price:
$15 - $9 = $6

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for L:

L + 8 + L = 22
Combine like terms:
2L + 8 = 22
Subtract 8 from both sides:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but not before bed. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, let's add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we find the rate of the fog bank per minute: 3 miles / 10 minutes = 0.3 miles per minute.

Now, we divide the total distance of the city by the rate of the fog bank per minute: 42 miles / 0.3 miles per minute = 140 minutes.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many pieces Poppy placed, we need to calculate a quarter of 1000. 

A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250 pieces. 

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. 

A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250 pieces. 

750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. So, the inner dimensions of the box will be (5 - 2*1) by (6 - 2*1) by (4 - 2*1), which is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

So, the inner volume of one box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday and Tuesday: 2 episodes of 1-hour shows = 2 * 1 = 2 hours
- Wednesday: x episodes of 30-minute shows
- Thursday: 1 episode of 1-hour show + 1 episode of 30-minute show = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 episodes of 1-hour shows = 2 * 1 = 2 hours

Total time watched = 2 + x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours

Combine like terms: 5.5 + x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides: x = 1.5

Since x represents the number of 30-minute episodes, and there are 2 30-minute episodes in 1 hour, we need to convert x to hours: x = 1.5 hours

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing x by 0.5: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.
2. This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.
6. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

"To find the total cost of the gas before the cashback, we multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons: 
3.00 * 10 = 30.00

Then, we find the total cashback by multiplying the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons:
0.20 * 10 = 2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost of the gas to find the final cost:
30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both of them. 
Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people).
Average roll-ups = Total roll-ups / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet rowed, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. 

Rate = 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters/foot

Now, we need to find the total distance to the shore. We are given that the shore is 64 seconds away, but we also know that it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We can use this information to find the rate at which Julia is rowing.

Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now that we have the rate at which Julia is rowing, we can find the total distance to the shore.

Distance = Rate * Time = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now that we know the total distance to the shore, we can find the total amount of water taken on.

Total water taken on = Rate * Distance = 0.2 liters/foot * 80 feet = 16 liters

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. 
   Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B. Then, Jamal's phone can hold 6B photographs.

2. We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. 
   So, 6B = 1800

3. To find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, we need to solve for B.
   B = 1800 / 6
   B = 300

4. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
   Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as D. Then, 300 = 50D

5. To find the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, we need to solve for D.
   D = 300 / 50
   D = 6

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24.

The total selling price is 10 * $15 + 5 * $24 = $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. 

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially was 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Lylah's salary was 100% - 30% = 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

2. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his original salary and add it to his original salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

3. Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% and his original salary was $40000, while Lylah's original salary was $28000. The ratio of their original salaries is $40000 : $28000 = 10 : 7. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40%, Lylah's salary will increase by 40% of the ratio of her original salary to Adrien's original salary, which is (40/10) * 7 = 28%. 

4. To find Lylah's new salary, we need to calculate 28% of her original salary and add it to her original salary. 28% of $28000 is 0.28 * $28000 = $7840. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $7840 = $35840.

5. To find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $35840 = $91840.

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, and there are 60 letters needing stamps, we can calculate the number of letters she added as follows:

60 (letters needing stamps) * 1/3 = 20 letters added

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie added 20 letters. To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the number of letters she added from the current number of letters in the pile:

30 (current number of letters) - 20 (letters added) = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a watermelon and an orange. 

Let's denote the cost of a pepper as P, the cost of a watermelon as W, and the cost of an orange as O.

Given that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can write the equation:
W = 3P

Given that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, we can write the equation:
O = W - 5

We are given that each pepper costs $15, so we can substitute P = 15 into the first equation to find the cost of a watermelon:
W = 3 * 15
W = 45

Now that we know the cost of a watermelon, we can find the cost of an orange:
O = W - 5
O = 45 - 5
O = 40

Now that we know the cost of each item, we can find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
Total cost = (4 * W) + (20 * P) + (10 * O)

"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the total equation, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation above:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B:

B = 2Q
B = 2(100)
B = 200

Now that we know B, we can find W:

W = 2B
W = 2(200)
W = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add the tax to the non-food items.

Food items: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Cups: $3

Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 + $3 = $8

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items: $3 + $4 = $7

Tax on non-food items: 10% of $7 = 0.1 * $7 = $0.70

Total cost of non-food items with tax: $7 + $0.70 = $7.70

Total cost of all items: $8 (food items) + $7.70 (non-food items with tax) = $15.70

The final answer is: $15.70"
"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need. Since he has 8 clients (3 current + 5 potential), and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32, and the cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40. 

Total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Since his total income is $92, the profit will be $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of hectares, and then multiply that by the number of harvests in a year.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John has 10 hectares, so the total number of pineapples per year is 100 * 10 = 1000 pineapples per hectare.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is 1000 * 10 * 4 = 40000 pineapples.

The final answer is: 40000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces.
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each set together:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours and haven't returned yet is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours and haven't returned yet is still 15 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

The number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent the number of Dorothy's friends as x. This means Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the value of x.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of James' friends. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply the number of Dorothy's friends by 4:
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances to the same unit. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires.

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we will work backwards from the end.

1. There were 5 french fries left after the ants carried off a final french fry.
2. Before the ants took one, there were 6 french fries left.
3. Two thirds of the remaining fries were taken by the raccoon. Let's call the total number of fries remaining before the raccoon took some ""x"". Then, 2/3x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 9.
4. Before the raccoon took 2/3 of the fries, there were 9 fries left. Since the raccoon took 2/3 of the fries, the raccoon took 2/3 * 9 = 6 fries. So, the raccoon took 6 fries and there were 9 - 6 = 3 fries left.
5. Before the pigeons ate, there were 3 fries left. Each pigeon ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons. So, the pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were 3 + 9 = 12 fries.
6. The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. This means that before the seagull ate, there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries.
7. Before the seagull ate, there were 21 fries. Since the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 21 + 14 = 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is the sum of the hours for both sets of days, which is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length, we need to convert the length of the baguettes to inches and then add the lengths of all the baked goods together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Finally, let's convert the total length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the total length is 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for 1 month and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total bananas per month = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total number of bananas per month by 2.

Total bananas for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the distance she ran back and forth and the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances. Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance. So, 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards."

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given steps:

1. The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (2) and then divide by the denominator (3). 

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the depth of the water on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught.

Anakin caught 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.

Since Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by Locsin: 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish.

To find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin, we add the number of fish caught by each of them: 19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. 

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write the equation: S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Since S = 2B, we can substitute B = 8 into this equation to find Seth's age: S = 2(8) = 16.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. 

Average cost of pants = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform.

Total cost of each uniform = $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the spiders:
80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the insects:
90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

Now, let's calculate the number of legs for the mutant invertebrates:
3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Finally, let's add the number of legs for each group together:
640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs

The final answer is: 1210"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
   Let's denote Sally Two's age as S2 and Granny Red's age as GR. Then, S2 = GR + 3.

2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
   Let's denote Sally Four's age as S4. Then, GR = 2 * S4.

3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
   S4 = 8 (since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old).

4. We can now find Granny Red's age using the information from steps 2 and 3.
   GR = 2 * S4 = 2 * 8 = 16.

5. Now we can find Sally Two's age using the information from steps 1 and 4.
   S2 = GR + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

6. The total age of the four birds is the sum of their ages: S2 + S4 + GR + Sally Thirtytwo.
   Total age = 19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 51.

The final answer is: 51"
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to first calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt and then add them together. 

The minimum payments are: 
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

50% of each minimum payment is: 
- Student loans: 50% of $300 = 0.5 * $300 = $150
- Credit card: 50% of $200 = 0.5 * $200 = $100
- Mortgage: 50% of $500 = 0.5 * $500 = $250

The increased minimum payments are: 
- Student loans: $300 + $150 = $450
- Credit card: $200 + $100 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 + $250 = $750

Now, we add the increased minimum payments together: 
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to find the yearly amount: 
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and the time it takes to cut one potato, then multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1 minute and 30 seconds = 90 seconds
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Total time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Now, multiply the total time to peel and cut one potato by the total number of potatoes:
95 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60:
5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of making a gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

2. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

3. The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5.

4. Since they made a total profit of $25, and the profit per gallon is $5, the number of gallons they made is $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

5. The total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons, which is $3 * 5 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Since the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we need to subtract this from the total number of Chinese participants to find the number of girls on the Chinese team.

Girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Boys on the Chinese team
Girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To find the amount of money Zaid has left after all expenses and donations, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent: 
   Zaid's monthly salary = 6000$
   Rent = 1/4 of 6000 = (1/4) * 6000 = 1500$

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
   Car fuel = 1/3 of 6000 = (1/3) * 6000 = 2000$

3. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
   Remaining amount = 6000 - (1500 + 2000) = 6000 - 3500 = 2500$

4. Calculate the amount donated to charity:
   Donation = 1/2 of 2500 = (1/2) * 2500 = 1250$

5. Calculate the remaining amount after donation:
   Remaining amount = 2500 - 1250 = 1250$

6. Calculate the amount given to his daughter and wife:
   Total given to daughter and wife = 200 + 700 = 900$

7. Calculate the final remaining amount:
   Final remaining amount = 1250 - 900 = 350$

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
3. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs the three have together: 
40 (Bo's crabs) + 36 (Monic's crabs) + 46 (Rani's crabs) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first week, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he tutored: 
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

To find out how much he earned in the second week, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he tutored:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total:
$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted. 

3/4 * 80 = (3 * 80) / 4 = 240 / 4 = 60

Since the total number of students who voted is 80, and the winner got 60 votes, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x. 

The number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, which is 5x. However, we are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. So, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses, which is 4x. 

Number of red roses = 4 * 40
Number of red roses = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

From point 2, two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Half of 28 is 14, and 5 years older than that is 19. So, two years ago, Mark was 19 years old.

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago, and we can find his current age by adding 2 to that. Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, Jean is two years older than Mark. Since Mark is 21, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between the two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is:

P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll is:

P(even, even) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage:

Difference = P(>3) - P(even, even) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Difference (%) = 0.25 * 100 = 25%

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to find half of the number of apples her mom picked. 

Her mom picked 20 apples. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10. 

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. 

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as R, the number of hamsters as H, and the number of rabbits as B. 

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats is 3R. 

The total number of hamsters is given as 10. 

The total number of rabbits is not given, but we know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among them. Since each rabbit gets the same amount of straw, we can denote the number of rabbits as B = 20 / x, where x is the amount of straw each rabbit gets. However, since the problem does not mention anything about the amount of straw each rabbit gets, we can assume that the amount of straw given to the rabbits is the total amount of straw given to the rabbits, not the amount each rabbit gets. Therefore, we can directly use the number of rabbits as B = 1.

The total number of straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, we can set up the following equation:

6 * 3R + 5 * 10 = 160

Simplifying the equation:

18R + 50 = 160

Subtract 50 from both sides:

18R = 110

Divide both sides by 18:

R = 110 / 18
R = 110 / (2 * 9)
R = 55 / 9

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given values:
Principal (P) = $100
Rate (R) = 2% or 0.02 (as a decimal)
Time (T) = 3 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $100 * 0.02 * 3
= $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Mandy should pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $100 + $6
= $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The cost of buying the bags is $20x, and the cost of transporting them is $2x. The total cost is the sum of these two, which is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x, and the total profit is $400. Since profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up the equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides, then add them together.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25 for 3 tickets. 
Cost of tickets = 20.25 * 3 = 60.75

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. 
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - 4.50 = 60.75 - 4.50 = 56.25

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = 2 * 33 = 66

Now, we add the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides together to get the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides = 60.75 + 56.25 + 66 = 183

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each of them paid.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3 = 183 / 3 = 61

The final answer is: $61"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to first find out how many minutes he collects peaches for. Since he collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches a minute. So, in 180 minutes, he will collect 2 x 180 = 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks need per day, we first need to find out how many pounds they need per week. Since there are 10 ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week. 

Now, we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by the number of days in a week to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom plants and chops down each year: 
   Trees planted per year = 10
   Trees chopped down per year = 2
   Net change per year = 10 - 2 = 8

2. Calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years:
   Initial number of trees = 50
   Net change per year = 8
   Number of years = 10
   Total trees after 10 years = 50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130

3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years:
   Percentage of trees that die = 30%
   Total trees after 10 years = 130
   Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.3 = 39

4. Calculate the final number of trees Tom has:
   Total trees after 10 years = 130
   Number of trees that die = 39
   Final number of trees = 130 - 39 = 91

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.
2. On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. 
   So, the number of pink flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.
   The number of white flamingos is 6.
3. On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, making the total number of pink flamingos 12 + 18 = 30.
4. The total number of white flamingos remains 6.
5. To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Now, let's find out how much money she will spend. 
Total money spent = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total money spent = 10 * $2
Total money spent = $20

Since Violetta spent all her money, she will get no change."

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

First, let's calculate the new salary after the 5% raise:
New salary = Old salary + (Old salary * 0.05)
New salary = 2000 + (2000 * 0.05)
New salary = 2000 + 100
New salary = 2100

Since John works every week of the year, there are 52 weeks in a year. 
Total earnings = New salary * Number of weeks
Total earnings = 2100 * 52
Total earnings = 109200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total earnings:

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she had initially and the total number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 x 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 x 6 = 12.

The total number of pens she bought is 54 + 12 = 66.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to buy the jacket and shoes, and then subtract the amount she already has and the amount she earns from babysitting.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, and she earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount she has is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

The amount she still needs is $70 (total cost) - $30 (total amount she has) = $40.

She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns from mowing the lawn ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

1. The total number of eggs collected is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so W = R + 2.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of eggs collected:

3R + 5W = 42

Substitute W = R + 2 into the equation:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expand the equation:

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now that we have the perimeter, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time Gary spends walking. The distance is the perimeter of the park, which is 15 miles, and the speed is 3 miles/hour.

time = distance / speed
time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50) = 2x + 50.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. Since the number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days and the customers on the third day, we can set up the equation:

2x + 50 + x = 500

Combine like terms:
3x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides:
3x = 450

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 150

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 150), we can find the number of customers on the second day:
x + 50 = 150 + 50 = 200

The number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days:
200 + 150 = 350

"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

The rate at which water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. 

We can set up the differential equations for the amount of water in each pool over time 't' as follows:

d(x_small)/dt = -4 (since the small pool is leaking)
d(x_big)/dt = -4

We are given that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can write the equation:

x_big = 4x_small

We also know that the initial conditions are:
x_small(0) = x
x_big(0) = 2x

Since the differential equations are linear and homogeneous, we can solve them using the method of separation of variables.

However, in this case, we can also use the fact that the rate of change of the difference between the two pools is constant. Let's define a new variable 'y' as the difference between the amount of water in the big pool and the small pool:

y = x_big - x_small

Then, we have:
dy/dt = d(x_big)/dt - d(x_small)/dt = -4 - (-4) = 0

This means that y is constant over time. Since y is constant, we can write:

y = x_big - x_small = 2x - x = x

Now, we are given that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can write:

x_big = 4x_small

Substituting this into the equation y = x, we get:

x_big - x_small = x
4x_small - x_small = x
3x_small = x
x_small = x/3

Since the small pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago was x + 4*4 = x + 16 gallons. 

However, we know that the initial amount of water in the small pool is x. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 16 = x
This is a contradiction, which means that the initial condition x + 16 = x is not possible.

However, we can try another approach. We can use the fact that the rate of change of the difference between the two pools is constant. Let's define a new variable 'y' as the difference between the amount of water in the big pool and the small pool:

y = x_big - x_small

Then, we have:
dy/dt = d(x_big)/dt - d(x_small)/dt = -4 - (-4) = 0

This means that y is constant over time. Since y is constant, we can write:

y = x_big - x_small = 2x - x = x

Now, we are given that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can write:

x_big = 4x_small

Substituting this into the equation y = x, we get:

x_big - x_small = x
4x_small - x_small = x
3x_small = x
x_small = x/3

However, this is not the correct solution. Let's try another approach.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

The rate at which water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. 

We can set up the differential equations for the amount of water in each pool over time 't' as follows:

d(x_small)/dt = -4
d(x_big)/dt = -4

We can solve these differential equations using the method of separation of variables.

d(x_small)/dt = -4
dx_small = -4dt
∫dx_small = ∫-4dt
x_small = -4t + C1

d(x_big)/dt = -4
dx_big = -4dt
∫dx_big = ∫-4dt
x_big = -4t + C2

We are given that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can write:

x_big = 4x_small

Substituting this into the equations, we get:

-4t + C2 = 4(-4t + C1)
-4t + C2 = -16t + 4C1
C2 = -12t + 4C1

We are also given that the initial conditions are:
x_small(0) = x
x_big(0) = 2x

Substituting these initial conditions into the equations, we get:

x = -4(0) + C1
C1 = x

2x = -4(0) + C2
2x = -12(0) + 4C1
2x = 4C1
C1 = x/2

Now, we can substitute C1 into the equation C2 = -12t + 4C1:

C2 = -12t + 4(x/2)
C2 = -12t + 2x

Now, we can substitute C2 into the equation x_big = -4t + C2:

x_big = -4t + (-12t + 2x)
x_big = -16t + 2x

We are given that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can write:

x_big = 4x_small

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

-16t + 2x = 4(-4t + x)
-16t + 2x = -16t + 4x
2x = 4x
x = 0

However, this is not the correct solution. Let's try another approach.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

x_big = -4t + C2

We are given that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can write:

x_big = 4x_small

Substituting this into the equations, we get:

-4t + C2 = 4(-4t + C1)
-4t + C2 = -16t + 4C1
C2 = -12t + 4C1

We are also given that the initial conditions are:
x_small(0) = x
x_big(0) = 2x

Substituting these initial conditions into the equations, we get:

x = -4(0) + C1
C1 = x

2x = -4(0) + C2
2x = -12(0) + 4C1
2x = 4C1
C1 = x/2

Now, we can substitute C1 into the equation C2 = -12t + 4C1:

C2 = -12t + 4(x/2)
C2 = -12t + 2x

Now, we can substitute C2 into the equation x_big = -4t + C2:

x_big = -4t + (-12t + 2x)
x_big = -16t + 2x

We are given that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can write:

x_big = 4x_small

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

-16t + 2x = 4(-4t + x)
-16t + 2x = -16t + 4x
2x = 4x
x = 0

However, this is not the correct solution. Let's try another approach.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

The rate at which water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. 

We can set up the differential equations for the amount of water in each pool over time 't' as follows:

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Janeth will pay and then subtract it from the total amount she borrowed.

First, let's calculate the total interest Janeth will pay. The interest rate is 10% of the principal amount, which is $2000. 

Interest = Principal * Rate
Interest = $2000 * 0.10
Interest = $200

Since Janeth will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is:

Total Amount Paid = Monthly Payment * Number of Months
Total Amount Paid = $165 * 12
Total Amount Paid = $1980

However, this amount includes the principal and the interest. To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the interest from the total amount paid.

Remaining Balance = Total Amount Paid - Interest
Remaining Balance = $1980 - $200
Remaining Balance = $1780

However, this is not the correct answer because the interest is not paid over the 12 months, but rather the principal and interest are paid over the 12 months. So we need to calculate the interest paid over the 12 months.

Interest Paid Over 12 Months = Principal * Rate * Number of Months
Interest Paid Over 12 Months = $2000 * 0.10 * 12
Interest Paid Over 12 Months = $240

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance by subtracting the interest paid over 12 months from the total amount paid.

Remaining Balance = Total Amount Paid - Interest Paid Over 12 Months
Remaining Balance = $1980 - $240
Remaining Balance = $1740

The final answer is: $1740"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to find the number of dahlias first. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

= 4 + 7
= 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:

- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. Half of 68 is 68 / 2 = 34. 10 more than 34 is 34 + 10 = 44. So Yuri scored 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points. 17 more than 68 is 68 + 17 = 85. So Brianna scored 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, the points scored by Jojo is 251 - 197 = 54.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the given steps:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A: 
   30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
   Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700.

2. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
   3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
   Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280.

3. The rest of the students went out through exit C:
   So, the number of students who went out through exit C = 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, let's find out how many more candies John has than James:

John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies. The difference is 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of books read, we need to consider the books each person reads. 

Dolly has 2 books and reads her own 2 books, as well as Pandora's 1 book. So, Dolly reads a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has 1 book and reads her own 1 book, as well as Dolly's 2 books. So, Pandora reads a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

In total, they read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of letters Mike receives and responds to, we first need to find the number of letters he receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. 

Since he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, he has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he receives and sends is 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes used for the calls with his boss and the extra minutes. 

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for the calls with his boss: 
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Then, let's add the extra minutes: 
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end Griffin had 27 fries, so we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the value of 'x'.
7. Solving the equation, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 again to isolate x:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked, the total cost before the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

1. Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
2. Total hours worked for the entire movie: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
3. Total cost before the discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
4. Calculate the 10% discount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
5. Total amount paid after the discount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find the total cost of the party supplies, we need to add the cost of each item:

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) = $55
$55 + $15 (decorations) = $70
$70 + $4 (invitations) = $74
$74 + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Now, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each person paid:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

2. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

3. To find the total number of cookies Sue ate, we add the cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

4. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so the total number of cookies her sister ate is 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

5. To find the total number of calories Sue consumed, we multiply the total number of cookies she ate by the number of calories per cookie: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

6. To find the total number of calories her sister consumed, we multiply the total number of cookies she ate by the number of calories per cookie: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

7. To find the difference in calories consumed, we subtract the calories her sister consumed from the calories Sue consumed: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The school has 3 classes with 20 students in each class, so the total number of students in the school is 3 x 20 = 60.

2. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so the total number of boys and girls in the school is 60 x 1 = 60.

3. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls is equal. Therefore, the number of boys in the school is also 30.

4. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. The total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

5. Since the school has 30 girls in total, and 27 girls are in the first two classes, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

6. Since the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

Then, add the number of apps he downloaded: 52 + 18 = 70

The final number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars Rick killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars Rick killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves he killed today. 

Solving for x, we get x = 12 / 3 = 4. However, this is the number of cougars, not wolves. We already know that the number of wolves he killed today is 3x, so the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 4 = 12.

Now, let's find the total number of animals Rick killed. Last night, he killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals. Today, he killed 12 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 12 + 12 = 24 animals.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 + 24 = 49.

"To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 = 0.3 * 30 = 9
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

Robert went down the slide 21 * 4 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to find the total number of cows Mr. Sylas bought and then divide that by 20 to find the number of cows each stall gets. 

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so there are 10 * 20 = 200 cows. 

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows is 200 + 40 = 240.

Now, we divide the total number of cows by 20 to find the number of cows each stall gets: 240 / 20 = 12.

Since we want to find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows each stall gets by 8: 12 * 8 = 96.

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total amount of money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together:

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to find the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find 30% of the total weight. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (since 30% is the same as 30/100 or 0.3): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

The termites ate 2400 pounds of the redwood, so we subtract this from the total weight to find the remaining weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's denote the number of apples that Jamal has as 'A' and the number of bananas that Jamal has as 'B'. 

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can write the equation: 
A + 8 = 52 (Andrea's apples)
A = 52 - 8
A = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can write the equation: 
B = A + 4
B = 44 + 4
B = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can write the equation: 
Andrea's bananas = B / 2
Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2
Andrea's bananas = 24

The total number of fruits is the sum of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have. 
Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples) + (Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
Total fruits = (52 + 44) + (24 + 48)
Total fruits = 96 + 72
Total fruits = 168

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 36 cookies and 30 cookies separately.

Since 1 dozen cookies require 2 cups of flour, we can find out how many cups of flour are needed for 1 cookie by dividing 2 cups by 12 cookies. 

2 cups / 12 cookies = 1/6 cup per cookie

Now, we can multiply the number of cookies Carla is making each day by the amount of flour needed per cookie to find out how many cups of flour are needed each day.

36 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 6 cups (for today)
30 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 5 cups (for tomorrow)

Now, we add the cups of flour needed for both days to find the total amount of flour needed.

6 cups (for today) + 5 cups (for tomorrow) = 11 cups

"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to find two thirds of 9,300. 

Two thirds of a number is calculated by multiplying the number by 2/3. 

So, we multiply 9,300 by 2/3. 

9,300 * (2/3) = (9,300 * 2) / 3 
= 18,600 / 3 
= 6,200 

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has, we need to first calculate the total number of marbles in the boxes and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Total marbles in the boxes = 5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 5 * 50 = 250 marbles

Now, add the marbles she received from her friend: 
Total marbles = 250 + 20 = 270

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the number of trees in Harry's yard, we need to find the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard first. 

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Since Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have, we need to first find out how much money each of them has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money they have: 
$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $300.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

First, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 
Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee: 
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, let's add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house: 
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to subtract her budget from the total price: 
Difference = Total price - Budget = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

1. Calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
2. Calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
3. Calculate the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
4. Subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000
5. Subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (heating up to 300 degrees) + 28 (heating up to 400 degrees) + 23 (cooking) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is 71."

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in both houses is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows: 12 + 8 = 20.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.
4. The total number of stitches in the sweater is 1800.

We know that the total number of stitches is the sum of the stitches in the body, collar, rosette, and both sleeves. Let's represent the number of stitches in each sleeve as 'x'. 

The total number of stitches in the sweater can be represented as: 
Body + Collar + Rosette + 2 * Sleeves = 1800
900 + 90 + 180 + 2x = 1800

Combine the constants: 
1270 + 2x = 1800

Subtract 1270 from both sides: 
2x = 530

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 265

The number of stitches in each sleeve is 265."

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A:
2/5 of 80 cards had the letter A: (2/5) * 80 = (2 * 80) / 5 = 160 / 5 = 32

Now, we find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter A:
80 - 32 = 48

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B:
1/2 of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B: (1/2) * 48 = (1 * 48) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter B:
48 - 24 = 24

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter C:
5/8 of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C: (5/8) * 24 = (5 * 24) / 8 = 120 / 8 = 15

Now, we find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter C:

From the first statement, we have: R = 6S

From the second statement, we have: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute R from the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra. 

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, the number of spots on a mamba is half the number of spots on a cobra.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we need to multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

Now, we need to find the total number of spots on both cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras: 2800
Total spots on mambas: 2100
Total spots on both: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

To find half the number of spots, we need to divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450"
"To find the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 
Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 
The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"

"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 
The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40. 

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star is 40 / 5 = 8.

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, we multiply 8 packets by 5 chocolate bars per packet: 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars.

2. Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and there are 4 adults, we multiply 4 adults by 6 chocolate bars per adult: 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars.

3. Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get. Since there are 8 children and 16 chocolate bars left, we divide 16 by 8: 16 / 8 = 2.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to first find the total time she worked. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time. 

3 hours = 180 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
180 minutes - 30 minutes (pause) = 150 minutes

Now, we know Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 per interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate the points of each player after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he gets no extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he gets no extra point.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

So, after the extra points had been distributed, Mike has 21 + 0 = 21 points, Jim has 18 + 0 = 18 points, and Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players is 21 + 18 + 43 = 82."

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total rice consumed per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg/day = 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the number of days by 7.

14 days / 7 days/week = 2 weeks

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates sold on each day and the weekend. 

Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend. 
On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. 
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates. 
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, we need to add the crates he would have sold on those days to reach his target. 
A week has 7 days, and he was closed on 2 days, so he was open for 5 days. 
If he sells an average of 120/7 = 17.14 crates per day, then on Monday and Friday, he would have sold 2 * 17.14 = 34.28 crates.

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will round down to 34 crates.

Total crates he would have sold = 65 + 34 = 99

To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to subtract the total crates he sold from his target. 
Sam's target = 120 
Total crates sold = 99 

Crates off from target = 120 - 99 = 21

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent on bids. 

The initial bid is $200. 
The other 3 people each bid once, so the total number of bids after them is 3. 
Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 people, she makes 3 bids. 
The total number of bids is 3 (from the other people) + 3 (from Carmen) = 6 bids.

Each bid increases by $50. 
So, the total increase in the price of the desk is 6 bids * $50 = $300.

The total cost of the desk is the initial bid + the total increase in price. 
Total cost = $200 + $300 = $500.

The final answer is $500."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year, the total cost of driving per year, and add the monthly bonus.

1. Total miles driven per year:

   Total miles per week = 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
   Total miles per year = 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

2. Total cost of driving per year:
   Cost per mile = $2
   Total cost per year = 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

3. Monthly bonus:
   Bonus per month = $150
   Total bonus per year = $150 * 12 months = $1,800

4. Total cost per year:

"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the folded paper. 

When the paper is folded, the left and right sides are mirrored. 

- The left side will have pages 1, 2, 3, ..., 16.
- The right side will have pages 32, 31, 30, ..., 17.

Since the paper is folded, the left and right sides are mirrored, so the number of pages on each side is the same. 

Therefore, we have 16 pages on the left side and 16 pages on the right side. 

However, we also need to consider the middle page, which is page 17. This page is printed on the inside of the folded paper, so it is counted only once.

So, the total number of pages is 16 (left side) + 16 (right side) + 1 (middle page) = 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To find out how much Annika spent on food and snacks, we need to calculate half of $50. 

Half of $50 is $50 / 2 = $25.

Annika spent $25 on food and snacks and an additional $10 on rides, so the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

To find out how much is left, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought. 

$50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is $15."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as x. 
2. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.
3. The total number of books sold in the first two years is 2x + x = 3x.
4. The total number of books sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200 (since there are 50 unsold books).
5. Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money earned in three years is 200 * 20 = 4000.
6. The total amount of money earned in the first year is 2x * 20 = 40x.
7. The total amount of money earned in the current year is x * 20 = 20x.
8. The total amount of money earned in the second year is the difference between the total amount of money earned in the first two years and the current year, which is (40x + 20x) - 20x = 40x.
9. We know that the number of books sold in the current year is 45, so x = 45.
10. The total amount of money earned in the second year is 40x = 40 * 45 = 1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate his total hours worked in April: 
50 hours/week * 4 weeks = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage: 
200 hours * $10/hour = $2000

Next, we add the weekly bonus for 4 weeks: 
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, we add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus: 
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20, since 20% is the percentage of people he lost to. 

20% of 20 = (20/100) * 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people."
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales: 
   60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening: 
   Half of the remaining loaves is (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the problem states that the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we need to divide the 10 loaves by 2 to find out how many are sold in the afternoon:
   10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks Sandy needs:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, the answer is 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5, which is 15. This is because the serum affects the drinker every 3 days and every 5 days, so the LCM represents the time interval at which the drinker will grow both an extra arm and an extra leg.

Since the drinker will grow limbs every 15 days, and the total time is 15 days, the drinker will grow limbs only once. 

In 15 days, the drinker will grow 1 extra arm and 1 extra leg. 

The total number of new limbs is 1 (extra arm) + 1 (extra leg) = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the business suits:
   6 business suits at $100 each = 6 x $100 = $600

2. Calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
   3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 x $50 = $150

3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
   The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   Cost of a business suit = $100
   5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 x $100 = $500
   The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

4. Calculate the total amount spent so far:
   Total spent so far = $600 (business suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

5. Calculate the total amount available for the trip:
   Total amount available for the trip = $6000 (initial amount) - $2000 (amount to be saved) = $4000

6. Calculate the amount left after subtracting the total amount spent so far from the total amount available for the trip:
   Amount left = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

7. The amount left is the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a day, we need to calculate the number of eggs eaten by the three people who eat three eggs each and the number of eggs eaten by the rest of the family.

Three people eat 3 eggs each, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs in total.

The rest of the family consists of 5 - 3 = 2 people.

These 2 people eat 2 eggs each, so they eat 2 * 2 = 4 eggs in total.

The total number of eggs eaten in a day is 9 + 4 = 13.

Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days) is 13 * 7 = 91.

1. Trent is 5 years older than Jane: T = J + 5
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn: J = Q - 3
3. Quinn is 30 years old: Q = 30

We can substitute the value of Q into the second equation to find Jane's age:
J = 30 - 3
J = 27

Now, we can substitute the value of J into the first equation to find Trent's age:
T = 27 + 5
T = 32

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, the number of players on the offense as O, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We are given the following information:

1. The total number of players is 105: D + O + S = 105
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense: O = 2D
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense: S = D/2

We can substitute the expressions for O and S from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

4.5D = 105

Divide both sides by 4.5:

D = 105 / 4.5
D = 23.33

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a player.

D = 23

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying 20 from Johanna and adding them to the existing 50.
   Total marbles = 20 (bought from Johanna) + 50 (existing) = 70

2. Calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him.
   Since his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, we need to find 2/5 of 20.
   2/5 * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8

3. Add the marbles given by Solomon's father to the total marbles.
   Total marbles = 70 (from step 1) + 8 (from step 2) = 78

4. Calculate the total weight of marbles.
   Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble.
   Total weight = 78 * 2 = 156

"Let's break down the information given:

- The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. 
- The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.
- The classroom has 30 boys.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

To find the total number of children, we need to add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together: 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123.

The final answer is: 123"
"Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires is 3 times the number of electric poles. So, the number of electric wires can be represented as 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation 3x = 45.

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation 3x = 45. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people at the party was 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 people.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

The total number of people who left is 10, and 3 of them are men, so the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils per box
= 70 / 8
= 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of change of the coffee's strength with respect to temperature and the rate of change of the coffee's strength with respect to the amount of liquid added.

Let's denote the initial strength of the coffee as S, the initial temperature as T, and the initial volume as V. We are given that each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. This means that the rate of change of temperature with respect to the number of ice cubes is -13 degrees per ice cube, and the rate of change of strength with respect to the number of ice cubes is -12 milliliters per ice cube.

We can write the rate of change of temperature as:

dT/dn = -13

where n is the number of ice cubes.

We can also write the rate of change of strength as:

dS/dn = -12

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The rate of change of strength with respect to the amount of liquid added is -12 milliliters per milliliter of liquid added. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, the total change in strength due to the cream is:

ΔS = -12 * 15 = -180 milliliters

Now, let's find the total change in strength due to the cooling. We know that the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees is:

n = 65 / 13 = 5

The total change in strength due to the cooling is:

ΔS = -12 * 5 = -60 milliliters

The total change in strength is the sum of the changes due to the cooling and the addition of cream:

ΔS_total = ΔS_cooling + ΔS_cream = -60 - 180 = -240 milliliters

The final answer is: -240"
"Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as 'x'. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of new records received is half the total number of old records brought in.

x / 2 = 7

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. 
   Total employees = 100
   Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

2. Since the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, 
   Number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers
   Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

3. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. 
   Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

4. To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

   Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
   Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80000

   Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
   Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144000

5. Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
   Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80000 + $144000 = $208000

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20. 

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find the total time it takes to charge from 60% to 100%. 

Since the phone recharges at 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, it will take 1 percentage-point / 1 percentage-point = 3 minutes to charge 1 percentage-point. 

Since the phone is already at 60% charged, we need to charge the remaining 40% (100% - 60%). 

So, the time it takes to charge 40% is 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

The final answer is: 2"

"To determine which job has the higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A: 
- Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Gross income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Total tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is less than $24,000, Job A has a higher net pay rate.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job B from the net income of Job A:
$24,000 - $32,400 = -$8,400

However, since we are looking for the difference in the job with the higher net pay rate, we should subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price after the first increase and then the price after the decrease.

Initial price per share: $8
Increase percentage: 50%
New price after increase = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
New price after increase = $8 + ($8 * 0.5)
New price after increase = $8 + $4
New price after increase = $12

Now, let's calculate the price after the decrease:
Decrease percentage: 25%
New price after decrease = New price after increase - (New price after increase * Decrease percentage)
New price after decrease = $12 - ($12 * 0.25)
New price after decrease = $12 - $3
New price after decrease = $9

Since Maria has 8 shares, we multiply the new price after the decrease by the number of shares:
Final value of all shares = New price after decrease * Number of shares

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. We can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by substituting x = 70:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. We are given that H = 2C, and the total number of animals is 60, so C + H = 60. 

Substituting H = 2C into the second equation, we get C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20. 

Since H = 2C, H = 2 * 20 = 40.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. The total number of legs is 4C + 2H = 4 * 20 + 2 * 40 = 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh starts juggling with on stage, we need to calculate the number of balls he had before the incident and then subtract the balls that were lost.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he has before the incident is 3 + 4 = 7.

However, he drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught by the crowd. So, the total number of balls lost is 3 - 2 = 1.

Now, subtract the number of balls lost from the total number of balls Josh had before the incident: 7 - 1 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's denote the weights of the animals as follows:
- Pink frog: P
- Blue beetle: B
- Green toad: T
- Yellow snake: S
- Red bird: R

Given that:
1. P = B
2. P = T
3. P = S - 10
4. P = R + 20

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can substitute P with 50 in the equations:
1. 50 = B
2. 50 = T
3. 50 = S - 10
4. 50 = R + 20

From equation 3, we can find the weight of the yellow snake (S):
S = 50 + 10
S = 60

From equation 4, we can find the weight of the red bird (R):
R = 50 - 20
R = 30

Now we know the weights of all the animals:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is:
50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds), the total weight is:
240 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The original distance is 5000 meters. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 

1/5 of 5000 is 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find the price of Juice Box B, we need to add 5 dollars to the price of Juice Box A. 
Price of Juice Box A = 4 dollars
Price of Juice Box B = Price of Juice Box A + 5 dollars
Price of Juice Box B = 4 + 5 = 9 dollars

To find the price of Juice Box C, we need to add 7 dollars to the price of Juice Box A.
Price of Juice Box C = Price of Juice Box A + 7 dollars
Price of Juice Box C = 4 + 7 = 11 dollars

To find how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first calculate how many cookies are used by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies used by her son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats the rest of the cookies, which is 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, we need to find the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount percentage is 40%. 
To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$30 * 0.4 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt: 
$30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price by 2: 
$18 * 2 = $36

"To find the percentage increase, we need to first find the difference in daily revenue and then divide it by the original revenue, and multiply by 100.

Original daily revenue = 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
New daily revenue = 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Difference in daily revenue = New daily revenue - Original daily revenue = $1100 - $1000 = $100

Percentage increase = (Difference in daily revenue / Original daily revenue) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100
= 10%

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

First, let's find out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Now, let's add the number of plant pots she needs for the daisies and the roses: 30 + 60 = 90.

So, April needs a total of 90 plant pots. Since she already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"To find the total time spent, we need to calculate the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows = 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since this is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 
0.3x = 15
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

This is the total time spent on all activities. Now, we need to find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are multiple friends, we will represent the number of friends as 'x'. The total cost for her friends to play mini-golf is 1 round * $5 * x = $5x.

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20. 
The total cost for her friends to ride the go-karts is 2 rides * $10 * x = $20x.

The total cost for all activities is $5x + $5 + $20x. 

We know that Morgan's dad has a budget of $90. So, we can set up the equation: $5x + $5 + $20x = $90.

Combine like terms: $25x + $5 = $90.

Subtract $5 from both sides: $25x = $85.

Divide both sides by $25: x = $85 / $25.

x = 3.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy had after buying the candy. Since he spent $10 and the candy costs $1.5 per pound, let's call the number of pounds of candy he bought 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

2. The change Billy had after buying the candy is $10 - 1.5x.

3. He then takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * (1/2) * (10 - 1.5x) = 0.05 * (5 - 0.75x) = 0.25 - 0.0375x.

4. We know that Billy bought 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = $2.

5. Setting the total cost of the gumballs equal to $2, we get 0.25 - 0.0375x = 2.

6. Now, we can solve for x. Subtract 0.25 from both sides: -0.0375x = 1.75.

7. Divide both sides by -0.0375: x = -1.75 / -0.0375 = 46.67.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pound of candy, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will keep the answer as a decimal for accuracy.

The final answer is: 46.67"
"Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45. 

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation: C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get: 45 = 2S - 5.

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5.

This simplifies to: 50 = 2S.

To isolate S, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2.

This simplifies to: 25 = S.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles
Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total distance in a day = 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it travels in a day by the distance it needs to travel before service:
Days between services = 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

Since the train can't travel a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question does not specify whether to round up or down, so we will leave the answer as a decimal.

Time taken to drive to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Now, let's find the time taken to drive back home. 

Distance back home = 240 miles
Speed back home = 80 mph

Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given the following information:

1. M = 3
2. S = 4M - 5
3. V = 3S
4. M + S + V = 50

We can substitute the value of M into the equation for S:
S = 4(3) - 5
S = 12 - 5
S = 7

Now, we can substitute the value of S into the equation for V:
V = 3(7)
V = 21

Now we can substitute the values of M, S, and V into the equation M + S + V = 50:
3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Since 31 people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting 31 from 50:
50 - 31 = 19

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.

Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can write an equation based on this information:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points + 14
Erin's current points = 3 * 8 + 14
Erin's current points = 24 + 14
Erin's current points = 38

Since Erin's current points are the sum of her initial points and 14, we can write another equation:

Erin's current points = x + 14
38 = x + 14

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation:

x = 38 - 14
x = 24

So, Erin had 24 points before scoring 14 points.

The number of pupils who like yellow is the total number of pupils minus the number of pupils who like blue and green. So, the number of pupils who like yellow is 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she got $56 from selling the apples at $4 per piece, we can divide the total amount by the price per apple to find the number of apples sold on Monday.

Number of apples sold on Monday = Total amount / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

Now, we know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day.

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair has 2 socks, so she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 
She also washed 15 loose socks. 
So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 
50 - 35 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cookies Rachel has left, we need to add the cookies she initially bought to the cookies Janet gave her, and then subtract the cookies her brother ate.

First, let's add the cookies Rachel bought and the cookies Janet gave her:
23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65

Now, let's subtract the cookies her brother ate:
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest:
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, let's calculate the total amount to be paid:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we can find the monthly payment by dividing the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"

Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between Cho's distance and Chloe's distance to see how many kilometers farther Cho hiked.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
= 112 km - 45 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the profit per hour, we need to first find the total cost of making the lemonade and the total revenue from selling the lemonade.

The cost of making the lemonade is $18 for 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups is 3 * 12 = 36 cups. 

The cost per cup is $18 / 36 cups = $0.50 per cup.

The total revenue from selling the lemonade is 36 cups * $1 per cup = $36.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is $18, and the total revenue is $36. So, the profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find the profit per hour. The profit per hour is the profit divided by the number of cups sold per hour. The profit is $18, and the number of cups sold per hour is 4. So, the profit per hour is $18 / 4 = $4.50.

The final answer is: $4.50"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52. 
50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the number of girls. 
Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13.

The number of girls who can perform is 26 - 13 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. 
So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.

Now, we add the cost of erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides at $2 per ticket. Since each ride costs 2 tickets, the total number of tickets she needs to buy is 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. The cost of the tickets is 18 * $2 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

The total cost for Dasha is $36, and the total cost for David is $30. 

The amount of money David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5 + 6 = 11) and then multiply by the respective ratio parts.

Let's calculate the number of popsicles each person has:

Total popsicles = 165
Ratio sum = 5 + 6 = 11

Number of popsicles Betty has = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Number of popsicles Sam has = (6/11) * 165 = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

Difference = 90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"

Time spent writing a song: 4 hours
Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we need to find the percentage of time spent editing. 

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time spent) * 100
= (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
= 0.2 * 100

"To find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we first need to find the total number of books in the shelving system. 

Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can find the total number of books by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns: 

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. To find double the number of books, we multiply the total number of books by 2:

36 books * 2 = 72 books

Then, we add 20 to this number:

72 books + 20 = 92 books

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first calculate how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can find 1/3 of 12 by multiplying 12 by 1/3. 

12 * (1/3) = 12 * 1 / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, Jenny gave 4 slices to Bill. 

Next, Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can find 1/4 of 12 by multiplying 12 by 1/4.

12 * (1/4) = 12 * 1 / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3

So, Jenny gave 3 slices to Mark.

Now, we know that Jenny gave away a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she has eaten is 7 (given away) + 2 (eaten) = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices in the pizza.

12 (total slices) - 9 (slices eaten) = 3

The final answer is: 3"

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we need to find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:

Flour: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags
Milk: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:

6 bags (flour) - 2 bottles (milk) = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the original energy consumption in watt-hours (Wh) per day. 

Original energy consumption per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh/day

Reduced energy consumption per day = 900 watts * (8 - 5) hours = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh/day

Energy saved per day = Original energy consumption per day - Reduced energy consumption per day
= 7200 Wh/day - 2700 Wh/day
= 4500 Wh/day

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours (Wh), we need to convert the energy saved per day from Wh to kWh.

Energy saved per day in kWh = 4500 Wh/day / 1000
= 4.5 kWh/day

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30.

Total energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he completed before his jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left
4,000 (steps left) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps taken during jog

"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time taken to read the book = Total words / reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, we need to add the time it takes to get to the airport to the time taken to read the book.

Total time taken = Time taken to read the book + Time to get to the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we need to subtract the total time taken from the time he has to be at the airport to find out how many minutes early he will be.

Time early = Time to be at the airport - Total time taken = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. 

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the initial $10.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds of taffy, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off is $1.50). 

For 2 pounds, the cost is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. 4 magnets at $0.25 each will be 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally initially had $10. After buying the items, she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the probability of each event and multiply them together.

The probability of a candle exploding is 1% or 0.01 (since it's 99% guaranteed not to explode).
The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 5% or 0.05.

Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities together to get the probability of both events happening: 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005.

Now, we multiply this probability by the total number of candles to find the expected number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode: 0.0005 * 50000 = 25.

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and her sister gathered twice as many, her sister gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees as she did from the tallest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = 45 for Joanne and 60 + 45 = 105 for her sister.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 45 + 105 = 150 for both sisters.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350.

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is x = 350 / 2 = 175.

"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. 

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, so C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, so 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve this system of linear equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the trip and add them together.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker.
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker.

Now, let's calculate the size of Zack's locker:
Zack's locker = 4 * Peter's locker = 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches

Now, let's calculate the size of Timothy's locker:
Timothy's locker = 2 * Zack's locker = 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches

"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of Stanley's comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's position. 

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of Stanley's comb: 6,000 feet
Difference in elevation: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find out how much money Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from the two banks and add it to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. 
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money he received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we add this amount to his initial capital of $5000. 
$12000 + $5000 = $17000.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many cats were taken away by the boats. Since 4 boats came and each carried 5 cats, we multiply 4 by 5 to get the total number of cats taken away: 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

2. Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats on the rock: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

3. Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. Since 3/5 of the remaining cats ran, we multiply 30 by 3/5 to get the number of cats that ran: 30 * (3/5) = 18 cats.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) cost $14 per month, so the total cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
   Let's represent the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. 
   We can write the equation: J = T - 6

2. The total savings is $6. 
   Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 
   Let's represent the savings from the jogger jeans as Sj and the savings from the tattered jeans as St. 
   We can write the equation: Sj + St = 6
   Since Sj is 1/3 of the total savings, Sj = (1/3) * 6 = 2
   Since St is the rest of the savings, St = 6 - Sj = 6 - 2 = 4

3. The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4. 
   The cost of the jogger jeans is J, and the cost of the tattered jeans is T. 
   We can write the equation: 2 = J - (J - 6) and 4 = T - 28
   Simplifying the first equation, we get: 2 = 6, which is incorrect. However, we can rewrite the equation as 2 = J - T + 6, then 2 - 6 = J - T, -4 = J - T. 
   Simplifying the second equation, we get: 4 = T - 28, 4 + 28 = T, T = 32

4. Now we know the cost of the tattered jeans (T) is $32 and the jogger jeans (J) is $4 more than the tattered jeans. 
   We can write the equation: J = T + 4
   Substituting T = 32, we get: J = 32 + 4, J = 36

5. The jogger jeans originally cost $36 and the tattered jeans cost $32. 
   The difference in cost is: 36 - 32 = 4

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts and then add them up.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of them attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. So, the homemade feeders attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She bought 3 bird feeders, and each of them attracts 20 birds. So, the store-bought feeders attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we add the birds attracted by both types of feeders: 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 
So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kenny has $50 in spending cash and needs $100 to go to the amusement park, so he needs to make $50 from selling his cards.
2. He sells each card for $1.5, so the number of cards he needs to sell to make $50 is:
   $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 (round down to 33, since you can't sell a fraction of a card)
3. Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he sells is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with.
4. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, 2/3 of x is equal to 33:
   (2/3)x = 33
5. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
   x = 33 * (3/2)
   x = 49.5
6. Since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, we round up to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can keep the decimal because it is the exact answer.

The final answer is: 49.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were expected to have two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests expected to have two hotdogs

Since these 18 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, they would have a total of 36 hotdogs. The remaining guests were expected to have one hotdog each, so we can calculate the number of guests with one hotdog as follows:

36 guests - 18 guests = 18 guests with one hotdog

Now, we know that 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the 18 guests who were expected to have two hotdogs got their second hotdog, and the remaining guests got an extra hotdog. We can calculate the number of guests who got an extra hotdog as follows:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests got an extra hotdog

Since these 22 guests got an extra hotdog, they were originally expected to have one hotdog. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of guests who were originally expected to have one hotdog, which is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we know Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Since Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we can find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew by multiplying 100 by 3/4.

   100 * (3/4) = 75

2. Next, we know Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Since Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons, we can find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew by multiplying 75 by 2.

   75 * 2 = 150

3. Finally, we know Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Since Prince Walter slew 150 dragons, we can find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew by multiplying 150 by 1/5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of candy bars George bought. Since he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money. 

The cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20. The remaining money spent on candy bars is 5 - 1.20 = $3.80.

Since each candy bar costs 0.75 dollars, the number of candy bars he bought is 3.80 / 0.75 = 5.0667. Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number.

However, we need to check if this solution satisfies the given conditions. If George bought 5 candy bars, he would have spent 5 * 0.75 = $3.75. This leaves him with 5 - 3.75 = $1.25, which is 25% of his money, not 1%.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to find the weight of one piece of cake. 

The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces, and it's cut into 8 pieces. 

Weight of one piece = Total weight / Number of pieces
Weight of one piece = 20 / 8
Weight of one piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, they have 2 pieces in total. 

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight - Weight of the pieces eaten
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - (2 * 2.5)
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges they have together. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

2. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 4 - 5 = -1 minute before Wayne. However, since Bernadette can't arrive before Wayne, we need to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave.

3. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to find the difference in time it takes for both of them to get to the theater. Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes and Wayne takes 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to leave 16 - 4 = 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: width = area / length. 

Plugging in the values we know, we get width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we know the width and length of the room, we can find the perimeter using the formula perimeter = 2 * (length + width). 

Plugging in the values we know, we get perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to baking and the temperature decrease due to the window being open.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to baking:
Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
Time spent baking = 3 hours
Total temperature increase = 5 * 3 = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window being open:
Time the window is open = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
Temperature decrease per 10 minutes = 2 degrees
Temperature decrease per hour = 2 * 6 = 12 degrees
Total temperature decrease = 12 * 0.5 = 6 degrees

Now, let's find the final temperature:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease = 6 degrees
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (1 hour 20 minutes) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so James' bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. 
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time.
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours. To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60. 
1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so we add 5 to the length of Movie C.
75 + 5 = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so we divide the length of Movie B by 4.
80 / 4 = 20 minutes

"To find the distance traveled, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can find the distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total hay consumed is:
Hay consumed = Distance * (1/2) = 16 * (1/2) = 8 bails.

The cost of the hay is:
Cost of hay = Hay consumed * Cost per bail = 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total money:
Change = Total money - Cost of hay = $30 - $24 = $6.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of sneakers and subtract the cost of the sneakers.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and he sold them for $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the cost of the sneakers:
The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total Revenue - Cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular ticket costs $12.
3. The soda costs $3.
4. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as 'x'. 

The total cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes the price of the movie ticket ($12), the price of the popcorn (x), and the price of the soda ($3). However, since the super ticket already includes the soda, we only need to add the price of the popcorn and the extra $1 to the cost of the movie ticket to get the total cost of the super ticket.

So, the equation becomes: 12 + x + 1 + 3 = 20

Combine like terms: 16 + x = 20

Subtract 16 from both sides: x = 4

However, we are told that you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means that the cost of the regular ticket, the popcorn, and the soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket.

The cost of the regular ticket is $12, the soda is $3, and the popcorn is x. The total cost of these items is 12 + 3 + x.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and you saved $2, so the total cost of the regular ticket, the popcorn, and the soda is 20 - 2 = 18.

Set up the equation: 12 + 3 + x = 18

Combine like terms: 15 + x = 18

Subtract 15 from both sides: x = 3

However, this is a different equation than the one we solved earlier. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

The super ticket costs $20, which includes the price of the movie ticket ($12), the price of the popcorn (x), and the price of the soda ($3). The regular ticket costs $12, and you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means that the cost of the regular ticket, the popcorn, and the soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and you saved $2, so the total cost of the regular ticket, the popcorn, and the soda is 20 - 2 = 18.

The cost of the regular ticket is $12, and the soda is $3. The total cost of these items is 12 + 3 = 15.

The cost of the popcorn is the difference between the total cost of the regular ticket, the popcorn, and the soda, and the cost of the regular ticket and the soda: x = 18 - 15

x = 3

The price of the popcorn is $3."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new cost. 

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"

Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

The value of the 2 rubies she received is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

The total value of the 3 sapphires she traded is subtracted from the total value of the sapphires she started with:
$6400 - $2400 = $4000

Now, we add the value of the 5 sapphires she has left and the 2 rubies she received:
$4000 + $2400 = $6400

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $6400."
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

So, 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans.

For plastic bottles: 
Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Each bottle is worth 3 cents. 
So, 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles.

Total earnings per week = 6 cents (aluminum cans) + 15 cents (plastic bottles) = 21 cents per week.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of each remora from inches to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 
6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2 to get the combined length. 
0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras make up. To do this, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100. 
(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is equal to one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'x':

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by the number of days he walks per week. 

3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. 

We know that Sarah spent $300 on the books and each book costs $15. 

To find the total number of books, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book: 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got:

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of children
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts and subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we need to find the total number of kids in the class who are allergic to anything. Since there are 32 kids in the class, we subtract the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything from the total number of kids.

Number of kids allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids not allergic to anything
Let's denote the number of kids not allergic to anything as x.

Number of kids allergic to anything = 32 - x

We know that the number of kids allergic to anything is equal to the number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. So, we can set up the equation:

32 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x.

x = 32 - 12
x = 20

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is 20."
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.

"To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 

20% of $1500 = 0.20 * $1500 = $300
The hotel price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total hotel cost is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The total cost of the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to determine how many tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

Three-quarters of 48 grains is calculated as: 3/4 * 48 = 36 grains.

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny: 48 + 36 = 84 grains.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to subtract the total amount they have already earned from their goal.

First, let's add the amount Keegan and Tasha have already earned: 
$83 (Keegan) + $91 (Tasha) = $174

Now, let's subtract the total amount they have from their goal:
$200 (goal) - $174 (total earned) = $26

"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply the number of songs Gabriel has by 3. 

Gabriel has 20 songs, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. 
Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many more songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel. 
To do this, we need to find out how many songs Gabriel can add to his player. 
Since his player can store up to 100 songs and he already has 20 songs, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his. 
Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player. 
So, Luri can add 80 - 40 = 40 fewer songs than Gabriel can add to his player.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. 

Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can multiply 2/5 by 60 to find the number of oranges he ate.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. 

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply 24 by 10 to find the total amount of money he gave up.

24 * 10 = 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total miles James runs in a week, we need to multiply the miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

Miles per day: 12
Days per week: 5

Total miles per week = 12 * 5 = 60 miles

Since James runs 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs per week by dividing the total miles per week by the miles per hour.

Total miles per week: 60
Miles per hour: 10

Total hours per week = 60 / 10 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

First, let's find out how many pounds of oats each horse consumes in a day:
Each horse consumes 5 pounds per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is:
10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of oats are consumed in 5 days:
40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to find out how many bags are needed to feed the horses for 5 days:
200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags

The final answer is: 4"

1. Find two thirds of Jana's total puppies: 
   Two thirds of 27 is (2/3) * 27 = (2 * 27) / 3 = 54 / 3 = 18

2. Now, we need to find one third of the Pomeranians, which we already know is 18:
   One third of 18 is (1/3) * 18 = (1 * 18) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, let's add the temperatures:
-48 + 21 = -27
-27 + (-3) = -30

Now, let's divide the sum by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Since he promises to save $2 daily, we can find the number of days it will take to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to first find out how many eggs he can place on the 2 trays. 

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and he has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs he can place is 24 * 2 = 48.

Since Jaime has 64 eggs, we need to subtract the number of eggs he can place from the total number of eggs he has. 

64 - 48 = 16

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8

"To find the final cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors after the discount and then divide by the total number of razors.

The original price of 2 packs of razors is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will get 2 packs of razors for the price of 1 pack, which is $4.00.

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so the final cost of 2 packs of razors will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will contain 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the final cost of 2 packs of razors by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them together.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

The shortest girl is 60"" tall.

Now, we add the heights of all the levels together: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636 / 12 = 53 feet.

"To find out how many oranges Ashley brought, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box: 5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make: 120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies.

"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as L, D, and B respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. L + D + B = 43 (total number of insects collected)
2. L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. D = B/2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:
(D + 7) + D + B = 43
Combine like terms:
2D + 7 + B = 43

Now, we can substitute the third equation into the above equation to get:
2(D) + 7 + (2D) = 43
Combine like terms:
4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
4D = 36

Divide both sides by 4:
D = 9

Now that we know D, we can find L using the second equation:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

First, we need to find out how many yards Mariah used. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 364 by 1/4.

364 * 1/4 = 364 * 0.25 = 91 yards

Next, we need to find out how many yards her grandma used. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 364 by 1/2.

364 * 1/2 = 364 * 0.5 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

"Let's denote the cost of a pack of strawberry gum as S, the cost of a pack of grape gum as G, and the cost of a pack of green apple gum as A.

We know that Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum, and 1 pack of green apple gum. The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can write the equation:

2S + G + A = 7

We also know that the cost of a pack of grape gum is $2, so G = 2. We also know that the cost of a pack of green apple gum is half as much as the cost of a pack of grape gum, so A = 2/2 = 1.

Now we can substitute the values of G and A into the equation:

2S + 2 + 1 = 7

Combine like terms:

2S + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2S = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear programming model. Let's define the variables:

- x1: number of 2 x 4 pieces of wood to buy
- x2: number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood to buy

The objective function is to maximize the total number of popsicle sticks, which is given by:

200x1 + 400x2

The constraints are:

1) Budget constraint: 4x1 + 6x2 ≤ 24 (since each 2 x 4 costs $4 and each 2 x 8 costs $6, and he has $24 to spend)
2) Non-negativity constraint: x1 ≥ 0 and x2 ≥ 0 (since he can't buy a negative number of pieces of wood)

We can rewrite the budget constraint as:

4x1 + 6x2 = 24 (since he will spend all his money)

Now, we can solve for x2 in terms of x1:

6x2 = 24 - 4x1
x2 = (24 - 4x1) / 6
x2 = 4 - (2/3)x1

Now, substitute this expression for x2 into the objective function:

200x1 + 400(4 - (2/3)x1)
= 200x1 + 1600 - (800/3)x1
= (600 - (800/3))x1 + 1600
= (1800/3 - 800/3)x1 + 1600
= (1000/3)x1 + 1600

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we need to find the value of x1 that maximizes the expression (1000/3)x1 + 1600. Since x1 is an integer, we can try different values of x1 to find the maximum.

However, we can also use the fact that the budget constraint is an equality, which means that he will spend all his money. In this case, we can use the fact that the cost of a 2 x 4 is $4 and the cost of a 2 x 8 is $6 to find the optimal solution.

Let's try x1 = 4 (buy 4 2 x 4 pieces of wood):

Cost = 4x1 = 4(4) = $16
Remaining budget = 24 - 16 = $8
x2 = 8 / 6 = 1.33 (round down to 1, since he can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood)
Number of popsicle sticks = 200(4) + 400(1) = 800 + 400 = 1200

Now, let's try x1 = 5 (buy 5 2 x 4 pieces of wood):

Cost = 4x1 = 4(5) = $20
Remaining budget = 24 - 20 = $4
x2 = 4 / 6 = 0.67 (round down to 0, since he can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood)
Number of popsicle sticks = 200(5) + 400(0) = 1000

Now, let's try x1 = 6 (buy 6 2 x 4 pieces of wood):

Cost = 4x1 = 4(6) = $24
Remaining budget = 24 - 24 = $0
x2 = 0
Number of popsicle sticks = 200(6) + 400(0) = 1200

Since x1 = 6 gives the maximum number of popsicle sticks, the optimal solution is x1 = 6 and x2 = 0.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of legs and then multiply it by the cost of each pair of snowshoes.

Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. 
Total number of legs = 4 legs/dog * 6 dogs = 24 legs

Since each pair of snowshoes is for 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Total pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Now, we multiply the total number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost of each pair to find the total cost.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Total weekly cost = $2.20 * 5
Total weekly cost = $11

Now, we need to find out how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly savings = Total weekly cost - Weekly bus pass cost
Weekly savings = $11 - $20

However, since we cannot have a negative savings, it seems there is an error in the calculation. The weekly bus pass costs more than the total weekly cost of bus trips."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
3. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
4. To find the total number of animals on the farm, we add the number of cows and sheep: 30 + 10 = 40 animals on the farm.
5. To find the total number of animals on the zoo, we add the number of cows and sheep: 60 + 20 = 80 animals on the zoo.
6. To find the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo combined, we add the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, the number of onions Rose bought is 4x and the number of potatoes she bought is 4y.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This can be represented as:

4x = 12 (equation 1)
4y = 4 (equation 2)

Solving equation 1 for x, we get:
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

Solving equation 2 for y, we get:
y = 4 / 4
y = 1

Now that we know x = 3 and y = 1, we can find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by adding x and y:
Total = x + y
Total = 3 + 1
Total = 4

"To calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to find the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, and his birthday is on the 19th of July, which is the 7th month. So, we need to calculate the days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 days

Now, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 / 180 = 583.33 calories per day.

The final answer is: 583.33"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald works 7 days a week, and he earns $30 per day. 

Total earnings = 7 days * $30/day = $210

He spent a total of $100.

Amount left = Total earnings - Amount spent
= $210 - $100

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the total distance Hannah needs to run, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap. 

Distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the amount Julie spent on clothes, we need to calculate 20% of $500. 

20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: 
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, we need to find 25% of the remaining money ($400) spent on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money:
$400 - $100 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack has 5 bags, the total number of bags is 8 * 5 = 40 bags. The total cost is 40 * $4 = $160.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8. Since she sold 40 bags, the total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

Now, let's calculate the profit. Profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, the profit is $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and then multiply it by the average number of punches per minute.

There are 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total number of minutes is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

"To find out how many cookies Josh made, we need to find one-fourth of the number of cookies Suzanne made. 

Suzanne made 36 cookies. One-fourth of 36 is 36 / 4 = 9. 

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, Josh made 9 cookies.

Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Two times 9 is 2 * 9 = 18.

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is 18."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has:
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = (3 * $80) / 5 = $240 / 5 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the initial total.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. The remaining problems are 100 - 48 = 52. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to find the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6

Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8

Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the number of rows of red and blue tulips to determine the maximum number of complete rows that can be planted.

GCF of 6 and 3 = 3

Therefore, Jackson can plant 3 rows of flowers."
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total amount of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins Heather will use for each of the three items. Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each item will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide 9 by 3/4.

To divide a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the reciprocal of the fraction. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3. So, we multiply 9 by 4/3.

9 * (4/3) = (9 * 4) / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12

Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate the daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then find the difference in the total cost.

Daily consumption before adding the device: 12 kilowatts per hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the daily consumption in dollars is:
Daily consumption before: 12 * 24 * $1.50 = $360
Daily consumption after: 14 * 24 * $1.50 = $504

Weekly consumption before: $360 * 7 = $2520
Weekly consumption after: $504 * 7 = $3528

The difference in weekly consumption is: $3528 - $2520 = $1008

"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs.

We are given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2. 

We are also given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation x - 2 = 20 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get x = 22.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has: 3x = 3 * 22 = 66.

The number of sofas Ophelia has is 20, and the number of sofas Jenna has is 2 fewer than the number of chairs she has, which is 66 - 2 = 64.

The total number of sofas is 20 + 64 = 84.
The total number of chairs is 22 + 66 = 88.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of CDs Tom bought. Since he bought a CD for $4, the total cost of CDs is 4x.

The total amount Tom paid is $48, which includes the cost of the CD and the headphone set. Let's assume the cost of the headphone set is y. Then, we can write the equation:

4x + y = 48

We are also given that Tom bought a CD for $4, and a headphone set. This implies that the cost of the headphone set is the difference between the total amount paid and the cost of the CD. So, y = 48 - 4 = 44.

Now, we can substitute the value of y in the equation:

4x + 44 = 48

Subtract 44 from both sides:

4x = 4

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 1

This means Tom bought 1 CD.

If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 left. With this amount, he could buy 44/4 = 11 CDs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in.
Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 3 times the number of people who got off minus the number of people who got off, we need to find 3 times 21 first:
3 * 21 = 63

Now, subtract 63 from 21 to find the number of people who get on:
21 - 63 = -42 (this is incorrect, as you can't have a negative number of people getting on the bus, so we need to rephrase the problem statement to 3 times fewer as 3 times the number of people who got off minus 3, which is 21 - 3 = 18 people getting on the bus)

Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (left) + 18 (got in) = 77

"Let's denote Jame's current age as 'J' and his cousin's current age as 'C'. 

Since Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, his current age is 27 - 5 = 22.

In 8 years, Jame's age will be 22 + 8 = 30, and his cousin's age will be C + 8.

According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can write the equation: C + 8 = 2(30) - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get: C + 8 = 60 - 5, C + 8 = 55.

Now, we solve for C: C = 55 - 8, C = 47.

So, Jame's current age is 22 and his cousin's current age is 47.

The difference in their ages is 47 - 22 = 25.

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of the printer as P, and the cost of one monitor as M. 

We are given that C = $1,100 and P = C - 400. 

We also know that the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400. So, we can write the equation: C + 2M + P = 2400.

Substituting the value of C and P in the equation, we get:
1100 + 2M + (1100 - 400) = 2400
Combine like terms:
1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400
Combine the constants:
1800 + 2M = 2400
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
2M = 600
Divide both sides by 2:
M = 300

"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the boys and then calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls.

Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, each group has 20 / 2 = 10 kids.

The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 60) seashells.

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find the number of shells brought by each girl: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's assume the number of candies George had initially is x.
2. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had initially is 2x.
3. George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5.
4. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 3.
5. To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 3 + 5, x = 8.
6. Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had initially: 2x = 2(8) = 16.
7. Since the number of candies Nick had initially is 16, and it hasn't changed, Nick still has 16 candies.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. 

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x each day in the second half.

The total number of days in April is 30. 

In the first half of the month, Elvis saves x for 15 days (half of 30). In the second half, he saves 2x for 15 days.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half: 15x + 15(2x) = 15x + 30x = 45x.

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

45x = 1125

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 45:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

This is the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month.

To find the amount he saves each day in the second half, we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * 25
2x = 50

2. For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, Antonella earns an additional 10% commission:
   Commission on the sales above $1000 = 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

3. Total commission earned by Antonella = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the sales above $1000
   Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill already has, we need to multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case. 

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Since Bill wants 2 bottles per guest and he has 70 guests, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest.

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs, we need to subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs.

140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a hot day, we need to calculate twice the time it takes him to swim a mile on a cold day and add 2 minutes to it. 

Time to swim a mile on a cold day = 16 minutes
Twice the time = 2 * 16 = 32 minutes
Time to swim a mile on a hot day = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. 
   Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. 
   Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. 
   So, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

3. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.
   To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake.
   Reduction = 5x - 4

However, we don't know the value of x (the daily recommended cups of coffee). To find the reduction, we need to know the value of x. But, we can express the reduction in terms of x.

Since we don't have a specific value for x, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the reduction as an equation: 5x - 4.

But, if we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 8 (a common assumption for many health organizations), then we can calculate the reduction.

If x = 8, 
   Reduction = 5x - 4 = 5(8) - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36

So, if the daily recommended cups of coffee is 8, Juan must reduce his coffee intake by 36 cups.

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we need to determine the total number of candles he needs. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since each pack of candles contains 5 candles, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total amount James spends on candles is 4 packs * $3 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70. 

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so the total for these three teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. The total amount for the first four teeth is $5.00 + $3.00 = $8.00.
4. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the last two teeth are worth $0.50 each.
5. The total amount for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.
6. The total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $8.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We are given the following information:

1. R = M + 20
2. R = A + 45
3. R = 80

From equation 1, we can express M in terms of R:
M = R - 20

Substituting R = 80 into the equation above, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

From equation 2, we can express A in terms of R:
A = R - 45

Substituting R = 80 into the equation above, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the values of M, A, and R, we can find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers:
Total goals = M + A + R
Total goals = 60 + 35 + 80
Total goals = 175

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he bought.

First, let's find out how much money Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. 
He spent 5 days, and each wooden action figure costs $5. So, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 5 * 5 = $25.

Since Peter has $70 and spent $25 on wooden action figures, he has $70 - $25 = $45 left.

Now, let's find out how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money. 
He has $45 left and each plastic action figure costs $2. So, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is $45 / $2 = 22.5. However, since you can't buy a fraction of an action figure, we'll round down to 22 plastic action figures.

Now, let's find the total number of action figures he bought. 
He bought 5 wooden action figures and 22 plastic action figures. So, the total number of action figures is 5 + 22 = 27.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then subtract that from the total number of roses Ford grows per week. 

Ford grows 40 roses per week. 
The total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford lacks per week: 
40 (Ford's roses) - 65 (ordered roses) = -25 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses Ford lacks per week by 4 to find the total number of roses he lacks per month: 
-25 * 4 = -100 roses per month.

Since we can't have a negative number of roses, it means Ford has a surplus of 100 roses per month. However, the question asks how many roses Ford lacks, so we need to consider the negative value as the answer.

The final answer is: -100"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the number of cups Judy bought be x. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, the number of dishes she bought is 2x.

The total number of cups Judy brought is x (since she bought a dozen, which is 12 cups), and the total number of dishes she brought is 2x.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. So, the number of dishes her friend brought is 2x + 20.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is x + 40. The total number of dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is 2x + (2x + 20) = 4x + 20.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend is (x + 40) + (4x + 20) = 5x + 60.

Since Judy bought a dozen cups, x = 12. 

Substituting x = 12 into the equation 5x + 60, we get 5(12) + 60 = 60 + 60 = 120.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. R + B + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 4500 / 3.01
B = 1499.34 (round to two decimal places)

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the values of R and G:

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Amazon cost = $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so the shipping cost is $4 * 2 = $8.

eBay cost = $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the Amazon cost from the eBay cost.

Difference = eBay cost - Amazon cost = $21 - $20 = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles every day.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per day, we need to divide the total grams of mushrooms he eats per day by the weight of the cup of mushrooms. 

200 grams / 100 grams = 2 cups of mushrooms per day

Since each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we multiply the number of cups by the grams of protein per cup.

2 cups * 3 grams/cup = 6 grams of protein per day

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7.

6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find out how much he still needs to pay, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we need to find out how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. We can do this by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents.

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the new weight after the increase, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 
So, the new weight is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds. 
12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into three parts: the first year, the second year, and the third year.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 24 = 34 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 48 = 58 games at the end of the third year.

Now, we need to add up the total number of games Steve has at the end of the third year, which is the sum of the games he had at the end of the first year, the second year, and the third year. 

22 (games at the end of the first year) + 34 (games at the end of the second year) + 58 (games at the end of the third year) = 114

"To find the rate of the plane, we can use the formula: rate = distance / time. 

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the rate as follows:
rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate.

time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how much Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Since Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa work for 12 hours a day. To find the total amount of chocolates they make together in a day, we add their individual hourly production and multiply it by 12.

Ruiz's total production in 12 hours = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production in 12 hours = 45 * 12 = 540 pounds

Total production = 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned in each time period, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours:
15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups

The total amount earned in the first 4 hours is:
60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours:
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

The total amount earned in the next 2 hours is:
20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the total amount earned in both time periods:
$30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To find the number of rotations per mile, we divide the total rotations by the number of miles per rotation. 

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations/month

To find the total number of rotations per year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Next, we need to apply the 30% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). 

$60 * 0.3 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items.

$60 - $18 = $42

Since the sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost. 

Now, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has.

$50 - $42 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total pounds of butter needed, we first need to find out how many pounds of butter are needed to make 4 dozen croissants. 

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, it will take 4 times that amount to make 4 dozen croissants. 

4 * (1/4) = 4/4 = 1 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 croissants. 

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of butter are needed to make 48 croissants. 

Since it takes 1 pound of butter to make 12 croissants, it will take 48/12 = 4 pounds of butter to make 48 croissants.

Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we need to multiply the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants by 7 (the number of days in a week).

4 pounds * 7 = 28 pounds of butter.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

Now, to find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Monica's street: 150 meters

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the additional funding for the remaining 45 months.

Initial funding for the first 5 months: 
The initial funding is $100,000 per month for 5 months. 
Total initial funding = $100,000 * 5 = $500,000

Additional funding for the remaining 45 months:
The funding increases by 50% each month, which means it is 1.5 times the previous month's funding. 
We can calculate the funding for each month as follows:
Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate the height after each week.

After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so the height became 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so the height became 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat.

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

"To find the number of students, we need to first find the total number of seats in the auditorium, then find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, then the number of seats occupied by the parents, and finally subtract the sum of these two from the total number of seats to find the number of seats occupied by the students.

Total number of seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Number of seats occupied by the administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Number of seats remaining after administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Number of seats occupied by the parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Number of seats occupied by the students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

1. Calculate the total number of poles at all intersections: 
   Number of poles per intersection = 6
   Number of intersections = 4
   Total poles = Number of poles per intersection * Number of intersections
   Total poles = 6 * 4
   Total poles = 24

2. Since each pole has 4 street lights, we can find the total number of street lights:
   Total street lights = Total poles * 4
   Total street lights = 24 * 4
   Total street lights = 96

3. Subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of lights:
   Number of non-functioning lights = 20
   Total functioning lights = Total street lights - Number of non-functioning lights
   Total functioning lights = 96 - 20
   Total functioning lights = 76

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he will chew 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner, so he chews 2 more pieces.

3. So far, Jim has chewed 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

4. He started with 20 pieces of gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

6. To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we subtract the pieces he gave away from the remaining pieces: 14 - 7 = 7.

"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (4) and then divide by the denominator (5). 

So, 200 * 4/5 = (200 * 4) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160.

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to first convert his height from inches to feet. 

There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we can divide Adam's height by 12 to get his height in feet: 

40 inches / 12 = 3.33 feet

Since Adam needs to be 4 feet tall to ride the roller coaster, we can subtract his current height from the required height to find out how much more he needs to grow: 

4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 0.67 feet. We know he grows 2 inches per year, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so we can convert his growth rate to feet per year: 

2 inches/year / 12 inches/foot = 0.17 feet/year

Now, we can divide the amount Adam needs to grow (0.67 feet) by his growth rate (0.17 feet/year) to find out how many years it will take: 

0.67 feet / 0.17 feet/year = 3.94 years

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round up to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can also round down because 3.94 is closer to 4 than 5.

"To find James' total profit, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the selling price, and then the commission.

1. Cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000
2. The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the cost to James is 70% of the cost: $250,000 * 0.7 = $175,000
3. Selling price of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000
4. Profit: Selling price - Cost = $250,000 - $175,000 = $75,000
5. James' commission: 10% of the profit = $75,000 * 0.1 = $7,500

"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find the total number of riders who can stay upright on the wave. Since 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate 25% of 100:
   25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

2. Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we calculate 60% of 25:
   60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

3. Since the remaining riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
   Total riders who can stay upright - Women = Men
   25 - 15 = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. 
   Let's denote the price of a diamond Jewell as D. Then, the price of a gold Jewell is (4/5)D.

2. The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. 
   So, the price of a silver Jewell is (4/5)D - 400.

3. We are given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000. 
   D = 2000

4. Now, we can find the price of a gold Jewell:
   Price of gold Jewell = (4/5)D
   = (4/5) * 2000
   = 1600

5. Now, we can find the price of a silver Jewell:
   Price of silver Jewell = (4/5)D - 400
   = (4/5) * 2000 - 400
   = 1600 - 400
   = 1200

6. To find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver Jewells:
   Total price = D + (4/5)D + ((4/5)D - 400)
   = 2000 + 1600 + 1200

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends is $60, and the cost per class is $10. We can set up the equation:

10 - x * 10 = 60

Simplifying the equation:

10 * 10 - 10x = 60
100 - 10x = 60

Subtract 100 from both sides:

-10x = -40

Divide both sides by -10:

x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of one apple and one orange, and then multiply the cost of each by the number of items Clyde wants to buy.

Let's denote the cost of one apple as A and the cost of one orange as O.

We are given two equations based on the given information:

1) 4A = 5.20 (the cost of 4 apples is $5.20)
2) 3O = 3.30 (the cost of 3 oranges is $3.30)

To find the cost of one apple (A), we can divide both sides of equation 1 by 4:
A = 5.20 / 4
A = 1.30

To find the cost of one orange (O), we can divide both sides of equation 2 by 3:
O = 3.30 / 3
O = 1.10

Now that we know the cost of one apple and one orange, we can find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
Total cost = (5 * A) + (5 * O)
Total cost = (5 * 1.30) + (5 * 1.10)
Total cost = 6.50 + 5.50
Total cost = 12.00

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to first calculate his new monthly salary after the raise and then add the bonus for a month. 

First, let's calculate the raise: 
5% of $20000 is 0.05 * 20000 = $1000. 
So, his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus: 
The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $21000 / 2 = $10500.

Now, let's calculate his total monthly income: 
$21000 (new salary) + $10500 (bonus) = $31500.

Now, we add the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger for a year, and the cost of fuel for a year:
$150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $230,000

The final answer is: $230,000"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"To find the cost of each mixture, we need to calculate the weighted average of the cost of almonds and walnuts in each mixture.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
Cost of almonds = (1/2) * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
Cost of almonds = (1/5) * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write the equation for the total number of legs as:
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means the sum of the number of sheep and geese is 20:
S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G:
G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation:
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation:
4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:
2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:
S = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds for a week (1 pound * 7 days). 
The cost of the more expensive coffee is $6 * 7 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"

2. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = $90.
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = $150.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money they have: 120 + 90 + 150 = $360.

To find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to divide the total amount by 3 (since there are 3 people). 

360 / 3 = $120.

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches/foot to get the initial height in inches.

Initial height in inches = 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the initial height (240 inches).

Height difference = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the height difference by the growth rate to find the number of days it will take to reach the target height.

Number of days = Height difference / Growth rate
= 360 inches / 30 inches/day
= 12 days

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. 

1. First, he needs to buy toys for the additional 8 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, he needs 8 more toys. 
   Total toys needed so far: 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys

2. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. 
   Total dogs now: 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new additional dogs) = 28 dogs
   Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 16 more toys for the new dogs. 
   Total toys needed so far: 12 (previous toys) + 16 (new toys) = 28 toys

3. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. 
   Total dogs now: 28 - 3 = 25 dogs
   Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 3 more toys for the dogs that left. 
   Total toys needed so far: 28 (previous toys) + 3 (new toys) = 31 toys

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation: 
T = t + 7

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for t:
2(t + 7) + 3t = 44
2t + 14 + 3t = 44
5t + 14 = 44
5t = 30
t = 6

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the twins:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many coins Rong and Neil save in total over 10 years. 

Rong saves 20 coins per month. To find the total number of coins Rong saves in 10 years, we need to multiply the monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year) and then by 10 (the number of years).

Rong's monthly savings: 20 coins
Rong's yearly savings: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Rong's total savings in 10 years: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many coins Neil saves per month, we need to multiply Rong's monthly savings by 2/5 and then add Rong's monthly savings.

Neil's monthly savings: 20 + (20 * 2/5) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins
Neil's yearly savings: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can set up the equation: 0.6x = $40 + $20 (vaccine cost). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.6x = $60. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.6: x = $60 / 0.6 = $100. 

So, the total bill is $100. 

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought: $125 - $100 = $25.

Number of pencils in the box = Total capacity of the box - Missing pencils
= 20 - 4
= 16 pencils

Since we want to find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs of pencils = Number of pencils / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8 pairs

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fireworks set off by the city, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks in each box. 

15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300.

40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. 

3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to add the number of fireworks set off by the city and the number of fireworks set off in her backyard.

Total fireworks Hannah will see = 120 + 15 = 135

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total number of people, we need to add Aiden and his 12 friends and the 7 friends they meet at the cinema. 
Total people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20

Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks per seat is 2 + 3 = 5.

The total number of drinks and snacks for the group is the total number of people multiplied by the number of drinks and snacks per seat. 
Total drinks and snacks = 20 * 5 = 100

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost is the total number of drinks and snacks multiplied by the cost per item. 
Total cost = 100 * $2 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's denote the weight that Gissela's truck can carry as G, Gordy's truck as Gd, and Gary's truck as Gy. 

We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. 
Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gd = G + 800. 
The total weight that all three trucks can carry is 11,600 pounds, so G + Gd + Gy = 11,600.

Substituting Gd = G + 800 into the equation G + Gd + Gy = 11,600, we get G + (G + 800) + Gy = 11,600. 
Simplifying the equation, we get 2G + Gy = 11,600 - 800 = 10,800. 
Now we have two equations: G = 4,000 and 2G + Gy = 10,800. 

Substituting G = 4,000 into the equation 2G + Gy = 10,800, we get 2(4,000) + Gy = 10,800. 
Simplifying the equation, we get 8,000 + Gy = 10,800. 
Subtracting 8,000 from both sides, we get Gy = 2,800.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 8 males and 6 females, so the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.
2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings. So, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
3. Since there are 8 males, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.
4. Since there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.
5. The total number of dumplings eaten is 32 (by males) + 18 (by females) = 50.
6. Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to calculate the total parts in the ratio and find out how much each part represents. 

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Since Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2, we can find out how much each part represents by dividing $100 by the total parts (5). 

$100 / 5 = $20 per part.

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so he initially had 3 * $20 = $60.

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald had $60 - $10 = $50 left.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Since Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, the turtle's speed is 1/5 of the cat's speed. 

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. 

To find the turtle's speed, we divide the cat's speed by 5: 
Turtle's speed = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second.

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 3 * 40 = 120 feet.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total hours they need to fundraise, we need to first find out how much they need to raise per hour. 

The amount they need to raise per hour is the total goal minus the amount they have already raised, divided by the number of hours they have already worked. 

Amount raised per hour = Total goal - Amount already raised
Amount raised per hour = $6300 - $2100
Amount raised per hour = $4200

Now, we need to find the total hours they need to fundraise. 

Total hours = Total goal / Amount raised per hour
Total hours = $6300 / $4200
Total hours = 1.5 hours

However, they have already worked for 3 hours, so we need to add the hours they have already worked to the hours they need to work. 

Total hours = 3 + 1.5
Total hours = 4.5 hours

The final answer is: 4.5"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

1. The city uses 40% of the river's water.
2. 80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 80% = 20%.

Now, we need to find 20% of the 40% of the river's water used by the city. To do this, we multiply 40% by 20%:

40% * 20% = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.08 * 100 = 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first find the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks will have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

14 days * $12/day = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"Let's break down the problem into two separate rates of production: chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate of production per hour, we can divide the total quarts by the total hours:

Rate of chocolate production = 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts/hour

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate of production per hour, we can divide the total quarts by the total hours:

Rate of vanilla production = 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts/hour

Now, we need to find the total quarts produced in 48 hours. We can multiply the rate of production for each flavor by the total hours and then add the results:

Total chocolate quarts = 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Total vanilla quarts = 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts = Total chocolate quarts + Total vanilla quarts = 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together. 

5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x 3 = 15

3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x 4 = 12
13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x 1 = 13

Now, let's add the costs together: 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50

The total cost before the discount is $50.

To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 10% (or 0.10): 50 x 0.10 = 5

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: 50 - 5 = 45

The final answer is: $45"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, Erin can get a free scoop for every 2 scoops she buys. So, for every 3 scoops, she pays for 2 and gets 1 free. 

To find out how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can buy, we can divide 4 by 3. 

4 / 3 = 1 with a remainder of 1

This means Erin can buy 1 set of 3 scoops (2 paid scoops + 1 free scoop) and 1 additional scoop. 

So, Erin should buy 3 scoops (1 set of 3) and 1 additional scoop, for a total of 4 scoops.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks and then subtract the total number of candies eaten by each person.

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. 

Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left after two weeks.

Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left after two weeks.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract the number of candies Ginger has from the number of candies Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to find the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the bathroom is 36 sq ft. Two-thirds of 36 is calculated as (2/3) * 36. 

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the whole number (36) and keep the denominator (3) the same. 

(2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles needed to cover 24 sq ft. For every square foot, Mr Boarden needs 24 tiles. 

To find the total number of tiles, we multiply the area (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24). 

24 * 24 = 576

"To find the total cost of picking blueberries, we need to add the initial cost and the cost per pound multiplied by the number of pounds picked.

Initial cost = $20
Cost per pound = $1.5
Number of pounds picked = 30

Total cost of picking blueberries = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds picked)
= $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
= $20 + $45
= $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store.

Cost per pound at the store = $2.5
Number of pounds = 30

Total cost at the store = Cost per pound at the store * Number of pounds
= $2.5 * 30
= $75

To find the savings, we subtract the total cost of picking blueberries from the total cost at the store.

Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost of picking blueberries
= $75 - $65
= $10

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find the total number of slices they ate. Since there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so each friend ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * 8 = 16 slices in total.

Bryce also ate 2/3 of his pizza, which is 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.

So, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and 2 friends is 16 + 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, so each friend ate ¾ * 12 = 9 slices. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * 9 = 18 slices in total.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Since there were 5 friends and each had a 12-slice pizza, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, let's use the information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can write this as an equation:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

100 - 10 = 9x + 10 - 10
90 = 9x

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 9:

90 / 9 = 9x / 9
10 = x

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - Students who like to bake = 50 - 10 = 40
- Students who like to play music = 2 * Students who like to play basketball = 2 * 5 = 10

Since the students who like to play video games or music = 40, and students who like to play music = 10, the number of students who like to play video games = 40 - 10 = 30

"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12. 

1/3 of 12 = (1/3) * 12 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
12 - 4 = 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
8 + 20 = 28

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total number of students in both classes is 80.
2. Since each class has the same number of students, we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class: 80 / 2 = 40 students per class.
3. In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4): 40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class.
4. To find the number of boys in each class, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class: 40 - 16 = 24 boys per class.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
2. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.
3. Sean has 56 marbles.

From point 2, we can deduce that Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

From point 1, we can deduce that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 224 (Carl's marbles) + 112 (Cal's marbles) = 336.

"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups required for the activity. 

However, the question states that the activity requires 12 groups, but the students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. This seems to be a contradiction. 

Assuming the question is asking how many more groups are needed to separate the students into six groups of equal size, we can proceed as follows:

First, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups they are to be separated into: 54 / 6 = 9. 

This means each group will have 9 students. 

Since the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find out how many groups are needed to have 9 students in each group. 

We already know that 54 students can be separated into 6 groups of 9 students each. 

To find out how many groups are needed in total, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group: 54 / 9 = 6.

However, the question asks how many more groups are needed to form, not the total number of groups. 

Since we already know that 6 groups are needed to separate the students into groups of 9, and the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find the difference between the two: 12 - 6 = 6.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them. 
90% of 30 = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading small stickers.
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers.
Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them. 
50% of 40 = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, Lorraine gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Step 4: Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading the remaining large stickers.
Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, Lorraine gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 60 small buttons from trading 60 small stickers.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. 
Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up a proportion:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up another proportion:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, we can find the number of cases the third house needs, which is x = 100 cases.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. To find the distance they drove, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 6 hours = 300 miles.

2. They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so half of that is 25 miles per hour. 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour.

3. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. To find the distance they hiked, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time.

Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

4. The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as E, the number of berries she collects as B, and the time she finishes the level as T. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, the number of enemies Ava jumps on is E + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, the number of berries Ava collects is B + 3. 
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, the time Ava finishes the level is T + 4.

The score for Emma is 10E + 5B + 30T. 
The score for Ava is 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T + 4).

Simplifying the score for Ava, we get 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120.
This simplifies to 10E + 5B + 30T + 195.

The difference between their scores is (10E + 5B + 30T + 195) - (10E + 5B + 30T).

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

The two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. 
So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. 
So, the total number of times they ride on the two extra days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the two extra days to find the total number of times they ride in a week.
Total times = 15 + 12 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish.

Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish after adding the new fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + O = 2(4 + W)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + O = 8 + 2W

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

O = 5 + 2W

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we can set up another equation:

O + W = 17

Substituting the expression for O from the first equation into the second equation:

(5 + 2W) + W = 17

Combine like terms:

3W + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3W = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

W = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the fuel efficiency.

Total miles driven per week = 5 miles * 5 days = 25 miles/day * 5 days = 125 miles/week

Now, let's calculate the fuel consumption per week:

Fuel consumption per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumption per week = 125 miles/week / 10 MPG
Fuel consumption per week = 12.5 gallons/week

Now, let's calculate the weekly fuel cost:

Weekly fuel cost = Fuel consumption per week * Fuel price
Weekly fuel cost = 12.5 gallons/week * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $37.50/week

The final answer is: $37.50"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Carrie has 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. 

Value of quarters = 140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie has 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 

Number of twenties spent = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Value of twenties spent = 6 * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties spent to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch.

Total amount spent = $35 + $120 = $155

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and the total number of eggplants separately and then add them together.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total fraction of TVs that are not OLED. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 8. 
1/4 = 2/8 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2)
So, the total fraction of non-OLED TVs is 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the fraction of non-OLED TVs from 1 (which represents the total). 
1 - 3/8 = 5/8.

Now, we multiply the fraction of OLED TVs by the total number of TVs sold to find the number of OLED TVs sold.
5/8 * 40 = (5 * 40) / 8 = 200 / 8 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

$300 (trip cost) / 2 = $150 (school contribution)

Now, we know that John has $50 and the total cost of the trip is $300. To find out how much he is missing, we subtract the school's contribution and John's contribution from the total cost:

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school contribution) - $50 (John's contribution) = $100

John is missing $100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. 

Given that it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and it was 45 degrees during the day, we can calculate the temperature at night as follows:

Temperature at night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature at night = 45 - 33
Temperature at night = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to be raised to prevent freezing. 

Temperature needed to prevent freezing = 32 degrees (the freezing point)
Current temperature at night = 12 degrees
Degrees needed to be raised = Temperature needed to prevent freezing - Current temperature at night
Degrees needed to be raised = 32 - 12
Degrees needed to be raised = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs needed as follows:

Number of logs needed = Degrees needed to be raised / Degrees each log heats
Number of logs needed = 20 / 5
Number of logs needed = 4

The final answer is: 4"

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then sum them up.

Initial number of employees = 200
Number of new employees hired per month = 20
Number of months = 3

Total number of employees after 3 months = Initial number of employees + (Number of new employees per month * Number of months)
= 200 + (20 * 3)
= 200 + 60
= 260

Total salary per employee per month = $4000

Total salary for 260 employees per month = 260 * $4000
= $1040000

Since the company hires new employees every month, the total salary for each month will be the same. Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months = Total salary for 260 employees per month * Number of months
= $1040000 * 3

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial rate is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new rate $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final rate $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting rate is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = (10 * 2) + (10.50 * 18) + (11.50 * 18)
= 20 + 189 + 207
= 416

Sally's total earnings = (10.50 * 2) + (10.50 * 18) + (11.50 * 0)  (Sally does not get the second raise)
= 21 + 189 + 0

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students. 

First, let's find the pass rate for the fifth graders. Since it's twice the pass rate of the fourth graders, and 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed, the pass rate for the fourth graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. Therefore, the pass rate for the fifth graders is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.

The number of fifth graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700.

The total number of students is 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many glass chips he has in total. 

Each bag holds 72 chips, so 2 bags will hold 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch of the mosaic. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and it's a square mosaic, we can find the length of the mosaic by taking the square root of the total square inches. 

The square root of 12 square inches is approximately 3.46 inches.

However, since the question asks for the length of the mosaic, we need to find the length of the base of the square mosaic. Since the height is 3 inches, the base will be the square root of the total square inches. 

The square root of 12 square inches is approximately 3.46 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 
The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to convert the total amount of tea consumed from quarts to gallons. 
38 quarts / 4 quarts per gallon = 9.5 gallons.

Now, we need to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party. We know that 10 quarts of tea were left, and 38 quarts were consumed. 
So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

"To find the total money used, we need to calculate the time each person plays and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Since they play for 4 hours, we convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. 
Two friends play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.
One friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

Now, let's calculate the total minutes each person plays in 240 minutes:
- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
- Two friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters each

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x, the amount of salt (and sugar) as y, and the amount of oil as z.

Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we have:
x = fragrance = citrus zest

Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we have:
y = sugar = salt

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, we have:
z = 2y

Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, we have:
y = 2x

Now we can substitute y = 2x into z = 2y:
z = 2(2x)
z = 4x

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can write the equation:
x + x + y + y + z = 10
x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10
8x = 10

Now we can solve for x:
x = 10/8
x = 1.25

Now we can find the amount of oil (z):
z = 4x
z = 4(1.25)
z = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, let's convert the hours into minutes. 
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
And 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, let's add the time for both days: 
Total time = 480 + 240 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. 
   Initial number of cars = 50
   Number of cars added during the first break = 20
   Total number of cars after the first break = 50 + 20 = 70

2. Then, we need to find the number of cars that left the parking lot during the lunch break. 
   Number of cars that left = 1/2 of the total number of cars after the first break
   Number of cars that left = 1/2 * 70 = 35

3. Now, we need to find the total number of cars that remained in the parking lot during the lunch break. 
   Total number of cars during the lunch break = Total number of cars after the first break - Number of cars that left
   Total number of cars during the lunch break = 70 - 35 = 35

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to multiply the number of cycles he does in a day by the number of tasks in each cycle and the pay per task.

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Pay per task: $1.20

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = 180 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $216

To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week.

Number of days in a week: 7
Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in a week
Weekly earnings = $216 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1512

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. We can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can substitute x = 47 into the equation:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total shipping cost, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then add them together.

Cost per pound: $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $1.40
Cost per mile: $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99

Now, we need to find the refund amount. 
Refund amount: 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find the total amount Milly will lose, we need to subtract the refund amount from the total shipping cost and add the original book price.

1. First, Mulan's father gave her $100, so we add this to her initial $40: $40 + $100 = $140.
2. Then, Mulan buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so we multiply the cost of one pair by 2: $30 * 2 = $60.
3. We add the cost of the jeans to her total: $140 + $60 = $200.
4. Next, Mulan buys a bag for $20, so we subtract this from her total: $200 - $20 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes
- 2 hours = 120 minutes (converting hours to minutes)
- 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Now, let's add up the time she spends on TikTok in a week:
72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes * 4 = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the base price and the additional charges. 

The base price is $129.00. 

The additional items Angela needs installed are 6 mirrors (4 are included in the base price, so 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors), 2 chandeliers (1 is included in the base price, so 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier), and 20 pictures (10 are included in the base price, so 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures). 

The total number of additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13.

The cost of the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the base price plus the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.40 (which is 40% as a decimal). 
   40% of $30.00 = $30.00 * 0.40 = $12.00
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then multiply it by 4 to find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain, and then multiply that by 10 to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Distance covered in the next 6 hours = Speed x Time = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
= 32 miles + 48 miles
= 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroos. Since they travel a total distance in 18 hours, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. However, we don't know the distance. 

Let's assume the distance is 'd'. Then, the speed of the kangaroos is d / 18.

Since there are 3 kangaroos, the total speed of the kangaroos is 3 * (d / 18) = d / 6.

Now, we are told that the turtles travel at half the speed of the kangaroos. So, the speed of the turtles is (d / 6) / 2 = d / 12.

Since there are 4 turtles, the total speed of the turtles is 4 * (d / 12) = d / 3.

We know that the turtles will travel the same distance 'd' as the kangaroos. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

So, the time taken by the turtles to travel the distance 'd' is d / (d / 3) = 3.

The final answer is: 3"

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so she has a total of:
$150 + $80 = $230

Since she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation to find out how much money she has in her purse:
Let x be the amount of money Erika has in her purse.
x + $230 = $400 + $50

Combine like terms:
x + $230 = $450

Subtract $230 from both sides:
x = $220

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow, and he has 3 cows, the total milk produced per day is 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can do this by dividing 25 by 5 (the amount of milk one cow produces per day).

25 / 5 = 5

So, the farmer needs 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day. Since he already has 3 cows, he needs 5 - 3 = 2 more cows.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6:
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3:
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2:
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

"Let's denote my age as x, my brother's age as y, and my sister's age as z.

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can write the equation: x = y - 3.

I am 2 years older than my sister, so we can write the equation: x = z + 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so we can write the equation: mom's age = 3y - 1.

When you add all our ages, you get 87, so we can write the equation: x + y + z + (3y - 1) = 87.

Now, we can substitute x = y - 3 and x = z + 2 into the last equation:

(y - 3) + y + z + (3y - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5y + z - 4 = 87

Add 4 to both sides:

5y + z = 91

Now, substitute x = y - 3 into the equation x = z + 2:

y - 3 = z + 2

Subtract 2 from both sides:

y - 5 = z

Now, substitute y - 5 for z in the equation 5y + z = 91:

5y + (y - 5) = 91

Combine like terms:

6y - 5 = 91

Add 5 to both sides:

6y = 96

Divide both sides by 6:

y = 16

Now that we know y, we can find x and z:

x = y - 3
x = 16 - 3
x = 13

z = y - 5
z = 16 - 5
z = 11

So, I am 13 years old."

- N(t) is the number of people infected after t days
- N0 is the initial number of people infected (10 in this case)
- r is the growth rate (6 people per day per infected person)
- t is the number of days (3 in this case)

However, since each infected person infects 6 others, we need to consider the total number of new infections each day. This is a geometric series with a common ratio of 6. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:
- S is the total number of new infections
- a is the first term (6 in this case)
- r is the common ratio (6 in this case)
- n is the number of terms (number of days)

However, since we are calculating the total number of people infected after 3 days, we need to add the initial 10 people to the total number of new infections.

First, let's calculate the total number of new infections after 3 days:

S = 6 * (1 - 6^3) / (1 - 6)
S = 6 * (1 - 216) / (-5)
S = 6 * (-215) / (-5)
S = 2580

Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720.

To find the total amount they received altogether, we add the tips of Rafaela and Julieta: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges given to her children.

Jennifer gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.

She also gave her son 3 oranges.

In total, Jennifer gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges, so to find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:

12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices sold and then multiply it by the price per slice.

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins, we need to find the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30. We are given that the number of gold coins is 70. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first find out how many burritos were given to the students. 

Number of students: 50
Number of burritos per student: 10
Total burritos given to students: 50 * 10 = 500

Now, we add the burritos eaten by Mr. George to the total given to the students.
Total burritos given to students and eaten by Mr. George: 500 + 20 = 520

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos given to students and eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered by Mr. George.
Total leftover burritos: 600 - 520 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Number of red cars: 12
- Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
- Number of blue cars = 3 * Number of green cars = 3 * 10 = 30
- Total number of cars = 75

We can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
= 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
= 75 - 52
= 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Sofie has as S, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Fawn has as F.

We are given the following information:

1. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can use substitution to solve this system of equations.

From equation 2, we can substitute S in equation 1:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms:
2A + F + 25 = 85

From equation 3, we can substitute A in the above equation:
2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85
Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2.

Weight of potatoes: 5 pounds
Weight of sweet potatoes: 5 * 2 = 10 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 from the weight of the sweet potatoes.

Weight of carrots: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

"To find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs, we first need to find out how many jello cups he needs in total. Since each kid will get 4 jello cups, and there are 30 kids, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since each box of jello makes 10 jello cups, we need to divide the total number of jello cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs. 120 / 10 = 12.

Now that we know Greg needs 12 boxes of jello, we can find out how much he will spend on jello. Each box costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 100% - 60% = 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost. 

$160 / 4 = $40. 

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add the pieces eaten on each day to find the total:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of 1 bottle of soda and 1 bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00

The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to find out how many chickens he sold. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5
= 900 / 5
= 180

So, Isaias sold 180 chickens.

Now, we know that he sold these chickens at $50 each, so the total amount of money he made from selling the chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

Since he made a profit of $2000, we can find the total cost of the chickens by subtracting the profit from the total amount of money he made:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to first calculate how much money she will get from selling the rope. 

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. 

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. 

Let's assume she buys a new rope that is x meters long. 

The cost of the new rope will be $1.5x. 

Since she got $40 from selling the old rope, she will have $40 - $1.5x left over.

To find out how long the new rope is, we need to know that the cost of the new rope is equal to the profit she got from selling the old rope. 

$1.5x = $40

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for x:

x = $40 / $1.5
x = 26.67

Since you can't buy a fraction of a meter of rope, we'll round down to 26.67 to 26 meters.

Now, let's calculate how much money she will have left over after buying the new rope:

$40 - $1.5 * 26
= $40 - $39
= $1

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Melanie's present age be x.

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her age in 10 years will be x + 10 = 18.

To find Melanie's present age, we need to solve for x:
x + 10 = 18
x = 18 - 10
x = 8

So, Melanie's present age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this time y.

In y years, Melanie's age will be x + y = 3x (since her age will be thrice her present age).

We know that x = 8, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
8 + y = 3(8)
8 + y = 24

Now, we need to solve for y:
y = 24 - 8
y = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

Next, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

The cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

The cost of the apples is 7 * ($4 / 2) = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Kelly's budget is $65, so we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as 'x' minutes. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the runtime of the final concert without the encore is 2x minutes. 

The total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 65 - 15, which simplifies to 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: x = 50 / 2, which simplifies to x = 25.

"Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is x + 11.

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation: x + 11 = 121.

To solve for x, we subtract 11 from both sides of the equation: x = 121 - 11, x = 110.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so its speed is 5x.

Substituting the value of x, we get: 5 * 110 = 550.

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. 

The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is five times as many times as Joe's, which is 5x.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is $6x + 3x + 5x = 14x.

We know that the total amount Tasha made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6 = $74.

The amount she made from mowing lawns is $14x, and we know that $6x is the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn. So, $14x - $6x = $8x is the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns.

Since $8x is the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns, and we know that $6 is the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation $8x + $6 = $74 to find the value of x.

$8x + $6 = $74
$8x = $68
x = $68 / $8
x = 8.5

Now that we know x, we can find the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns, which is $8x = $8 * 8.5 = $68.

The amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3x = 3 * 8.5 = $25.5.

The amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5x = 5 * 8.5 = $42.5.

The amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 + $25.5 + $42.5 = $74.

Since the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $74 = $6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Martha initially had x notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has x + 5 notebooks.

We are given that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

x = 7 - 5
x = 2

So, Martha initially had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x = 3(2) = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks, so the difference is:

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup Calvin's family will eat for dinner and then divide that number by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating, that's a total of 3 adults and 2 children, which equals 5 people. Each person eats one bowl, so they will eat 5 bowls in total.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since the family will eat 5 bowls, we can assume that the 5 bowls are equivalent to 5/4 of the adult-sized bowls, because 4 adult bowls is the same as 8 child bowls. 

Now, we need to find out how many child-sized bowls are equivalent to 5 adult-sized bowls. Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, 5 adult bowls will equal 10 child bowls (5 * 2 = 10). 

Now we know that there are 10 child-sized bowls of soup left. Since there are 2 children, we can divide 10 by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 

10 / 2 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of material needed for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the amount of material needed for small masks. We know that 4 small masks require 2 yards of material. To find the amount of material needed for 1 small mask, we can divide 2 yards by 4 masks:

2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per small mask

Now, let's find the amount of material needed for large masks. We know that 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material. To find the amount of material needed for 1 large mask, we can divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per large mask

Now that we know the amount of material needed for 1 small mask and 1 large mask, we can find the total amount of material needed for 20 small and 8 large masks:

Material needed for small masks: 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards
Material needed for large masks: 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards

Total material needed: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the total number of tickets she bought.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day (24 hours).

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total time spent on activities = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours.

Free time left in a day = Total hours in a day - Total time spent on activities
= 24 - 19
= 5 hours

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave to Jamie. 

1/5 of 30 is calculated by multiplying 30 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing 30 by 5. 

30 / 5 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Now, we need to subtract the marbles given to Jamie and Donald from the total number of marbles Dean had. 

30 (initial marbles) - 6 (marbles given to Jamie) - 10 (marbles given to Donald) = 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Adam's age four years ago be x. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: 
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
(60 - 8) = 2x
52 = 2x

Now, we need to solve for x:
x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. 

To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to Adam's current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find the total number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 to it.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Adding 100 acres to that gives us 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, we need to add the number of acres of both farms together. Farmer Brown's farm has 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm has 500 acres. 

200 + 500 = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly rate.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can write this as:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10
Packages per hour = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday:

Total packages per day = Packages per hour * 8
Total packages per day = 40 * 8
Total packages per day = 320

Now, let's calculate Colby's earnings for the day:

Earnings per package = $0.20
Total earnings = Total packages per day * Earnings per package
Total earnings = 320 * $0.20
Total earnings = $64

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then convert that time to hours. 

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to convert 180 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 180 by 60 to get 3 hours.

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 0.5 hours. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 3 hours, we multiply 3 by 2 (since 3 * 2 = 6 half hours) and get 6.

"Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 + y.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

3y = 18

Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

y = 6

The number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much money they spent on the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons, and they were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, we need to find out how much 12 balloons cost. 

   12 balloons / 2 balloons = 6 sets of 2 balloons
   6 sets * $0.5 = $3

2. Now, let's find out how much money they spent on the ice cream. They bought 2 tubs for $7 each.

   2 tubs * $7 = $14

3. Now, let's add up the total amount they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

   $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

4. Since they had the same amount of allowance, let's call it x. They combined their allowance to spend $28. So, the total amount of their allowance is $28.

5. Since they both had the same amount of allowance, we can set up an equation to find the amount of allowance each one of them received.

Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row. 

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is half of the total cups in each row.

9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that Lana must have 4 full cups of mint tea in each row and 1 cup left over."

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old: P + Pp + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than John: Pp = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age: P = Pp + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying the equation, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get: P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Simplifying the equation, we get: P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P = 2J + 10 into the equation: 2J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age: Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age: P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 
300 + 50 = 350

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled. Since Craig's brother has 50 more letters than Craig, and Craig has 300 letters, we can find the number of letters Craig's brother has by adding 50 to 300. However, we already know that. We need to find the number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled. Since Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, and Craig's brother has 50 more letters, we can find the number of words Craig's brother spelled by dividing 50 by 15 (the number of letters in each word) and then adding the result to 20 (the number of words Craig spelled). 
50 / 15 = 3.33 (round down to 3 since you can't spell a fraction of a word)
3.33 + 20 = 23.33 (round down to 23 since you can't spell a fraction of a word)
23 words * 15 letters/word = 345 letters

"To find out how much James paid for the CDs, we need to calculate the discount amount first. 

Original price of each CD: $15
Discount percentage: 40%

Discount amount = Original price * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $15 * 0.4
Discount amount = $6

Price James paid for each CD = Original price - Discount amount
Price James paid for each CD = $15 - $6
Price James paid for each CD = $9

Total cost of 10 CDs = Price per CD * Number of CDs
Total cost of 10 CDs = $9 * 10
Total cost of 10 CDs = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. 
Total amount James got from selling 5 CDs = Number of CDs sold * Selling price per CD
Total amount James got from selling 5 CDs = 5 * $40
Total amount James got from selling 5 CDs = $200

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the total amount he got from selling 5 CDs from the total cost of 10 CDs.
Money James was out = Total cost of 10 CDs - Total amount James got from selling 5 CDs
Money James was out = $90 - $200
Money James was out = -$110

The final answer is: -$110"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims before resting. 
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time James takes to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
Time = Distance / Rate = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James rests on the island. 
Time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance to be swum.
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Step 5: Calculate the new rate at which James swims the remaining distance.
New rate = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

Step 6: Calculate the time James takes to swim the remaining distance.
Time = Distance / Rate = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Step 7: Calculate the total time James takes to get across the lake.
Total time = Time to swim 12 miles + Time to rest + Time to swim the remaining 8 miles
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"

"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times: 
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal: 
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We are given the following information:
1. B = A + 20
2. B = D + 10
3. A + B + D = 45

From equation 1, we can express B in terms of A: B = A + 20.

Substituting B = A + 20 into equation 3, we get:
A + (A + 20) + D = 45
Combine like terms:
2A + D + 20 = 45

From equation 2, we can express D in terms of B: D = B - 10.
Substituting D = B - 10 into the equation above, we get:
2A + (B - 10) + 20 = 45
Combine like terms:
2A + B + 10 = 45

Now we have two equations with two variables:
1. 2A + B + 10 = 45
2. B = A + 20

Substituting B = A + 20 into the first equation, we get:
2A + (A + 20) + 10 = 45
Combine like terms:
3A + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3A = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
A = 5

Now that we know A, we can find B:
B = A + 20
B = 5 + 20
B = 25

However, the question asks for Azibo's score, which is A."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches. 

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages per inch, we can multiply 100 pages per inch by 1.5 inches.

100 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 150 pages

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then multiply it by the rate at which he staples reports.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling in minutes. He stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of reports he stapled, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval.

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So, her usual sleep duration is 8 hours. 

First, let's convert 8 hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Now, let's find the time she went to sleep. Since she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., she must have gone to sleep before 2:15 a.m. We know she usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. So, the total time she was awake is 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours 55 minutes. 

Converting 7 hours 55 minutes to minutes: 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes + 55 minutes = 475 minutes.

Since she was awake for 475 minutes, her sleep time is 1440 minutes (24 hours * 60 minutes/hour) - 475 minutes = 965 minutes.

Now, let's find the time she was sleepwalking: 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

Now, subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 965 minutes - 23 minutes = 942 minutes.

The final answer is: 942"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to find out how many measuring spoons he has in relation to the measuring cups. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen (24) measuring cups, we can find the number of measuring spoons by multiplying 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:

16 - 6 = 10

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 10 measuring spoons and 24 measuring cups, which is 34 in total.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. 

4/5 of 1000 = 800

Now, we need to find the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. 

Initial occupied beds = 100
Additional occupied beds = 700
Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we need to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total capacity = 1000
Total occupied beds = 800
Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find out how many emails are not work emails. 
   Total emails = 16

   Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails = 16 - 7 = 9

2. Then, we find out how many of these non-work emails are to family. 
   Family emails = (2/3) * Non-work emails = (2/3) * 9 = 6

3. Now, we find out how many of the non-work emails are not to family. 
   Non-family non-work emails = Non-work emails - Family emails = 9 - 6 = 3

4. Finally, we find out how many of these non-family non-work emails are to her boyfriend. 
   Boyfriend emails = (1/3) * Non-family non-work emails = (1/3) * 3 = 1

"To find the original number of people, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original number of people is x. Since Courtney overstated the number by 20%, the number she reported (48) is 120% of the original number (100% + 20% increase).

We can set up the equation as follows:

120% of x = 48

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:

1.2x = 48

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 1.2:

x = 48 / 1.2
x = 40

So, the original number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey picked up as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason picked up 2x balls. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan picked up 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

The total number of balls picked up by the three boys is the sum of the balls each of them picked up, which is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are given that Jason picked up 2 balls, so 2x = 2. Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x = 1 into 7x, which gives us 7 * 1 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we know that the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40. This means the pirates dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation for the total number of corn chips as:

x + (x + 15) + x = total number of corn chips

We know that x = 70, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 + (70 + 15) + 70 = total number of corn chips

Combine like terms:

70 + 85 + 70 = total number of corn chips

225 = total number of corn chips

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we need to find 50% of the cost of supplies. 
50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and W, respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. A + S + W = 339 (Total number of Pokémon caught)
2. A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + 5 + W = 339
Subtract 5 from both sides:
2S + W = 334

Now, substitute the third equation into the result:
2S + (4W - 13) = 334
Distribute the 2:
2S + 4W - 13 = 334
Add 13 to both sides:
2S + 4W = 347

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. 2S + W = 334
2. 2S + 4W = 347

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate S:
(2S + 4W) - (2S + W) = 347 - 334
Combine like terms:
3W = 13
Divide both sides by 3:
W = 13/3
W = 4.33 (approximately)

Now that we have W, we can find S using the third equation:
S = 4W - 13
S = 4(4.33) - 13
S = 17.32 - 13
S = 4.32

However, since the number of Pokémon must be a whole number, we need to re-examine our previous steps. We made an error in our calculation of W. Let's go back to the equation 2S + 4W = 347 and solve for W in terms of S:
2S + 4W = 347
Subtract 2S from both sides:
4W = 347 - 2S
Divide both sides by 4:
W = (347 - 2S)/4

Now substitute W into the first equation 2S + W = 334:
2S + (347 - 2S)/4 = 334
Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
8S + 347 - 2S = 1336
Combine like terms:
6S + 347 = 1336
Subtract 347 from both sides:
6S = 989
Divide both sides by 6:
S = 989/6
S = 164.83 (approximately)

However, since the number of Pokémon must be a whole number, we need to re-examine our previous steps. We made an error in our calculation of S. Let's go back to the equation 2S + 4W = 347 and solve for S in terms of W:

2S = 347 - 4W
Divide both sides by 2:
S = (347 - 4W)/2

Now substitute S into the first equation 2S + W = 334:
2((347 - 4W)/2) + W = 334
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
347 - 4W + 2W = 668
Combine like terms:
347 - 2W = 668
Subtract 347 from both sides:
-2W = 321
Divide both sides by -2:
W = -321/2
W = -160.5

Since the number of Pokémon cannot be negative, we made an error in our previous steps. Let's re-examine the equation 2S + 4W = 347. We can solve for S in terms of W:

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we divide 20 by 2 to get the number of episodes. 

20 / 2 = 10 episodes

Now, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total minutes John will spend watching the show.

10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then add them up.

1. Distance traveled in the first segment (southerly direction): 
Speed = 30 miles/hour
Time = 10 hours
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

2. Distance traveled in the second segment (northerly direction):
Speed = 18 miles/hour
Time = 2 hours
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total distance traveled so far.

3. Distance traveled in the third segment (southerly direction):
Speed = 22 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first and third segments, and subtract the distance traveled in the second segment:
Total distance = 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made, the ones she took home from the office, and the ones her friends brought. 

First, let's convert the fractions into whole numbers for easier calculation:
- 1 dozen = 12
- 1/2 dozen = 6
- 1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18

Now, let's add the brownies:
- Greta made 12 brownies.
- She took home 6 brownies from the office.
- Her friends brought 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.
- Total brownies before eating: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Now, let's subtract the brownies eaten during the party:
- 18 brownies were eaten.

Total brownies left over: 66 - 18 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to calculate 75% of 8.

75% of 8 = (75/100) * 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years).

The total age of all three family members is: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the weighted average of the time it takes for each type of string.

First, let's calculate the total time for each type of string:

- Polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Next, we add up the total time for all racquets: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

Now, we need to find the total number of racquets: 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 racquets

To find the weighted average, we divide the total time by the total number of racquets: 227 minutes / 12 racquets = 18.92 minutes per racquet

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

So, the perimeter of the fence is 50 feet.

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

2. Since she gave away 4 boxes, we need to subtract these from the total number of boxes she bought. So, 12 - 4 = 8 boxes are left.

3. Since each box contains 20 oranges, we need to find out how many oranges are in 8 boxes. 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

4. Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many oranges that is. 1/4 of 160 is 160 * 1/4 = 40 oranges.

5. Since Mrs. Harrington kept 40 oranges, we need to subtract this from the total number of oranges she had. 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

6. Mrs. Harrington sold the rest of the oranges, which is 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the number of states in the USA be x.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, the number of states in India can be expressed as (x/2) + 4.

We know that the total number of states in the USA is 50.

So, the number of states in India is (50/2) + 4 = 25 + 4 = 29.

The total number of states in both countries together is 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25 (amount needed).

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount needed by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$25 (amount needed) / $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. 
   Let's represent the number of cherries Richard has as R. 
   Then, Robert has R + 10 cherries.

2. Since Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up the equation: R + 10 = 30
   To find the number of cherries Richard has, we need to solve for R:
   R = 30 - 10
   R = 20

3. Now we know Richard has 20 cherries and Robert has 30 cherries. 
   To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to subtract the total number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries (60):
   Total cherries = 60
   Cherries Richard and Robert have = 20 + 30 = 50
   Cherries Jerry has = 60 - 50 = 10

4. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:
   Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday:
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4
15 = Sunday's apple pie - 4
Sunday's apple pie = 15 + 4 = 19
A = 19

Now, let's find the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday and Sunday:
- Saturday's gingerbread: G = 10
- Saturday's apple pie: A = 19 - 4 = 15
- Sunday's gingerbread: 15
- Sunday's apple pie: 19

Now, let's find the total earnings for two days:
- Total gingerbread sold: 10 + 15 = 25
- Total apple pie sold: 15 + 19 = 34
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150
- Total earnings from apple pie: 34 * $15 = $510
- Total earnings for two days: $150 + $510 = $660

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of ounces she will use and divide that by the number of ounces in each bottle.

Pamela will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so she will be outside a total of 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total number of ounces she will use (32) by the number of ounces in each bottle (8):

32 ÷ 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of blue car = $100

Discount amount = 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount amount
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can write an equation:

24 = 2x, where x is the age of the brother when Emil turns 24.

Solving for x, we get:
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

This means the brother is 12 years old now.

From point 2, we can write another equation:

24 = (2 * age of dad) / 2
24 = age of dad

This means the dad is 24 years old now.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of the dad and the brother now:
Age of dad now = 24
Age of brother now = 12
Sum of their ages = 24 + 12 = 36

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the plants and the space between them to feet. 

Since Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide, we need to convert 12 inches to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 12 inches is equal to 1 foot.

The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

Now, let's calculate the total space taken up by each plant, including the space between them. The total space taken up by each plant is the width of the plant plus the space between the plants, which is 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the flower bed in feet. The flower bed is 111 feet long.

To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space taken up by each plant. 

111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4

Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she only needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store. To find out how much money Pat will spend at the store, we need to multiply the number of plants she needs to buy by the cost of each plant.

27 * 6 = 162

10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining amount of soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 / 1 = 3 roses.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook. So, the total time it will take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours: 
- The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour, so in 3 hours, it cools the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours: 
- The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour, so in 4 hours, it cools the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours: 
- The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour, so in 2 hours, it warms up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net change in temperature is the sum of the changes: 
- 6 (low) + 12 (high) - 4 (warmed up) = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."

From point 2, we know that when Bill's dad saw the Comet, he was 30 years old. 

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, it means that 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the Comet. 

Now, let's find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the Comet for the second time. We are given that Bill was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3x.

Since 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the Comet, and Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, we can set up the equation:

x + 75 = 30 + 75 (since 75 years have passed)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 75 = 105

Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get:

x = 30

So, Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet. 

Now, let's find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the second time. We are given that Bill was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.

Since 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the Comet, and Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, we can find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the Comet by subtracting 75 from 90:

90 - 75 = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when his dad saw the Comet.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type and add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months (quarterly), so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights and splits the remaining 1/4 between France and Germany.
- The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day.

Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips the first plane makes, the second plane also makes x/2 trips.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips, we can set up the equation x/2 = 44. Solving for x, we get x = 88.

Now that we know the first plane makes 88 trips in a day, we can find the number of trips it makes to Greece, France, and Germany. The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so it makes (3/4) * 88 = 66 trips to Greece.

The remaining 1/4 of the flights are split between France and Germany, so the first plane makes (1/4) * 88 = 22 trips to either France or Germany. Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is half of 22, which is 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.
So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we subtract the total amount received from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (total received from parents) = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. 

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Since the total age of the children is 20, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. 

Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all children, which is A + A + 2A + W = 20 (since there are 4 children in total).

Combine like terms: 4A + W = 20.

We also know that the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, so 2A + W = 13.

Now we have two equations:

1) 4A + W = 20
2) 2A + W = 13

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate W:

(4A + W) - (2A + W) = 20 - 13
2A = 7

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 7/2
A = 3.5

Now that we know the average age of the group, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2A = 2 * 3.5 = 7

Now that we know Helene's age, we can find Wilfred's age:

Combined age of Helene and Wilfred = 13
Helene's age = 7
Wilfred's age = 13 - 7 = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount collected by Walter from his neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that Walter's lawyer will base his donation on. 

Walter's lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund. 

Amount that Walter's lawyer will donate = 3 * $2000 = $6000

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find 1/2 of 1500.

1/2 * 1500 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 6 (since there are 6 people in the family).
2. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices each kid gets is x. Then, the number of slices each adult gets is 2x.
3. Since there are 2 adults, the total number of slices they get is 2 * 2x = 4x.
4. The total number of slices the kids get is 4x (since there are 4 kids).
5. The total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 4x + 4x = 6
6. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 6
7. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 6/8 = 3/4
8. Since each adult gets 2x slices, each adult gets 2 * 3/4 = 3/2 slices.
9. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100: (3/2) / 6 * 100 = 50%

"To find the total time spent by Doctor Jones at the clinic, we need to calculate the time spent on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent at the clinic: 
- Time spent on rounds: 180 minutes
- Time spent on appointments: 300 minutes
- Total time spent: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert the total time spent to hours:
- Total time spent: 480 minutes
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Total time spent in hours: 480 / 60 = 8 hours

Time left to update records: 
- Total time at the clinic: 9 hours
- Time spent: 8 hours
- Time left: 9 - 8 = 1 hour

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake and subtract it from the target time of 5:00 pm.

The total time required to make the cake is:
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes
Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours = 120 minutes. 

Now, we add the 120 minutes to the 60 minutes to get the total time in minutes: 120 + 60 = 180 minutes.

Now we add the 180 minutes to the 20 minutes to get the total time in minutes: 180 + 20 = 200 minutes.

Now we add the 30 minutes to the 200 minutes to get the total time in minutes: 200 + 30 = 230 minutes.

Now we add the 10 minutes to the 230 minutes to get the total time in minutes: 230 + 10 = 240 minutes.

Now we convert the total time from minutes to hours and minutes: 240 minutes = 4 hours.

Now we subtract the 4 hours from the target time of 5:00 pm to find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake:

"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 chocolate bars. 

Combine like terms: 8x = 64. 

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8. 

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost:

Cost per session = $25 (rent) + $1.50 (per student) * 10 students = $25 + $15 = $40 per session
Total sessions per week = 3 days/week
Total sessions per month = 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month
Total cost per month = $40 per session * 12 sessions/month = $480

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:
Revenue per session = $40 per session (assuming each student pays the same amount)
Total revenue per session = $40
Total revenue per month = $40 per session * 12 sessions/month = $480

Since the total cost and total revenue are the same, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be the total revenue minus the total cost.

Expected earnings = Total revenue - Total cost
Expected earnings = $480 - $480
Expected earnings = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x' and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'.

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 4x. Similarly, since Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is 7y.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7y = 56

To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can solve these equations.

For Peter's boxes: 
4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

For Martha's boxes: 
7y = 56
y = 56 / 7
y = 8

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. This is the difference between x and y:
x - y = 16 - 8
x - y = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

4 * 12 = 48

Now, we add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population of porcupines:

50 (initial population) + 48 (babies born in a year) = 98

The final number of porcupines in the park after a year is 98."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

"To find the total amount of water in the tank after two days, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped each day and add them together.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water in the tank after two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. The remaining charge after 5 hours can be calculated as:

x * (1 - 0.09)^5

This is because the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, so the remaining charge is 100% - 9% = 91% of the previous hour's charge. This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.91.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. The remaining charge after 3 hours can be calculated as:

(x * (1 - 0.09)^5) * (1 - 0.07)^3

This is because the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour, so the remaining charge is 100% - 7% = 93% of the previous hour's charge. This is also a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.93.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x * (1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28

To solve for x, we can plug in the values and calculate:

x * 0.5987 * 0.8573 = 0.28

x * 0.5125 = 0.28

x = 0.28 / 0.5125

x = 0.546

Janet earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1,000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

$2,000 / $1,000 = 2

So, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the other fruits.

- 4 pears at $.5 each: 4 * $.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $.75 each: 5 * $.75 = $3.75

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we need to divide the number of packs by 10: 13 / 10 = 1.3 packs per friend.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack: 1.3 * 60 = 78.

However, since you can't divide a pack into fractions, we can round down to 1 pack per friend and give the remaining packs to the friends with more than 1 pack. 

So, 13 packs / 10 friends = 1 pack per 7 friends and 6 packs / 3 friends (6 / 3 = 2). 

The 7 friends who received 1 pack each will get 60 pieces each. The 3 friends who received 2 packs each will get 2 * 60 = 120 pieces each.

So, the 7 friends who received 1 pack each will get 60 pieces each, and the 3 friends who received 2 packs each will get 120 pieces each.

"Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, which is the sum of the earnings from the small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the expression for s from the first equation into the second equation:

4(2l) + 12l = 120

Expanding the equation:

8l + 12l = 120

Combine like terms:

20l = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

"To find the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe, we first need to find the amount he can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we need to find the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month. Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply the amount one dwarf can mine in a day by 40 and 30. 

40 dwarves * 36 pounds/dwarf/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to first find the unit rate of the first two packages. 

The unit rate is the price per sandwich. 

For the first package, the unit rate is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

For the second package, the unit rate is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the unit rate for all packages is the same, which is $1.5 per sandwich. 

Now, we can multiply the unit rate by the number of sandwiches in the third package to find the price. 

Price = unit rate * number of sandwiches 
Price = $1.5 * 8 
Price = $12

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate how much he still owes after selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Amount still owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment, which is 10% of the remaining amount.

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
= 0.10 x $2000
= $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

1. 40% of the red balloons burst: 
   Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:
   Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
   Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

3. 75% of the blue balloons were added:
   Number of blue balloons = 8
   Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
   Total number of balloons now = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability of the complement of the event ""Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework."" 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:

1. The substitute teacher is present and gives everyone an extension (50% chance of substitute teacher * 40% chance of extension = 20%).
2. The normal teacher is present, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (40% chance of normal teacher * 20% chance of convincing = 8%).
3. The normal teacher is present, but the class doesn't get an extension, and Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (40% chance of normal teacher * 60% chance of no extension * 20% chance of convincing = 4.8%).

The total probability of these scenarios is 20% + 8% + 4.8% = 32.8%.

Since the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the complement of the event ""Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework,"" we subtract the probability of the complement from 100%:

100% - 32.8% = 67.2%

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find the total number of soda bottles he will place and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find the total number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. 

Number of bottles = Total width of the driveway / Distance between each bottle
Number of bottles = 24 / 3
Number of bottles = 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to go to 7 more bottles (8 total bottles - 1 = 7).

Now, let's find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains. It will take him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next.

Total time = Number of bottles - 1 (since he starts at the first bottle) * Time to go from one bottle to the next

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in college and the total amount of loans he took. 

The total amount of money Jim lost while in college is the difference between his potential income and his actual income during those 4 years. 

Potential income = $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000
Actual income = $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000 (he didn't earn any money while in college, but he still had to pay for living expenses, so we'll assume he earned the same amount)

However, since he earned the same amount, we can assume he didn't lose any money from not working. 

The total amount of loans he took is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to break even, which is the sum of the loans and the potential income he could have earned during those 4 years.

Total amount = $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (potential income) = $300,000

Since his college degree tripled his income, his new income is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

To calculate how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we can use the formula:

Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $300,000 / $75,000
Time = 4 years

"To find the area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of each fabric piece is length * width, so the area of each piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he needs to multiply the area of one piece by 2. 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

Xavier's height in inches = 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we add the growth in inches to Xavier's height:

Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's height is already given in inches, which is 50 inches. Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:

Difference in height = Xavier's new height - Cole's height
= 51 inches - 50 inches
= 1 inch

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The sum of their shares is equal to $1920, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's find the total hours in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to find the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20000 = 0.21 * $20000 = $4200
Price in 2008 = $20000 - $4200 = $15800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15800 = 0.21 * $15800 = $3322
Price in 2009 = $15800 - $3322 = $12478

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12478 = 0.21 * $12478 = $2623.18

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (2 * 50 = 100) board the train. 
So, the number of people who descended is subtracted from the current total, and then the number of people who boarded is added: 140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. 
So, the number of people who descended is subtracted from the current total: 190 - 80 = 110

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to find the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 * 1 = 1 SqFt.

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile:

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of each tile
= 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
= 200

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost:

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets (since each twin bed requires 2 sheets)
- 1 king size bed = 1 * 1 = 1 king sheet (since each king size bed requires 1 sheet)

Total sheets per week = 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week.

- 2 twin sets = 4 sheets
- 1 king set = 1 sheet

Total sheets that can be washed in a week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets

Now, we can divide the total sheets per week by the total sheets that can be washed in a week to find the number of loads.

Loads per week = Total sheets per week / Total sheets that can be washed in a week
Loads per week = 9 / 5
Loads per week = 1.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can do 5 loads of laundry with 1 load having 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet left over.  So, we can do 5 loads of laundry in a week.

To find the total number of loads in a year, we multiply the loads per week by the number of weeks in a year.

There are 52 weeks in a year.

Total loads per year = Loads per week * 52
Total loads per year = 5 * 52
Total loads per year = 260

4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. 
   2 hours * $6/hour = $12

Now, let's add the costs together:
$200 (cast) + $600 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $932

The final answer is: $932"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest. The rest of the emails are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. Since he responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95

The average score is 95."
"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, and there are 700 small coupons, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, and there are 1400 big coupons, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together. The total cost is 3500 + 21000 = 23500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, the total cost is 23500 / 100 = 235 dollars.

The final answer is: $235"
"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. 
   So, now Sidney has 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

4. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 
   So, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find the number of trucks that did not have mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we need to find a quarter of 20. 

A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures. 

The number of trucks that did not have mechanical failures is 20 - 5 = 15.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion applied.

Since Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means that for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays the full price of 1 pound. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 3 pounds at the full price and 3 pounds at half the price.

The cost of 3 pounds at the full price is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

The cost of 3 pounds at half the price is 3 * ($4.00 / 2) = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and the total cost.

Number of Kayla's classmates: 25
Number of girls in her dance class: 7
Number of family members: 13
Total number of guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45
Number of guests who could not come: 4
Total number of guests attending: 45 - 4 = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, the number of additional guests is: 41 - 20 = 21

Cost for additional guests: 21 * $6 = $126
Total cost: $125 (initial fee) + $126 (cost for additional guests) = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent 1/4 of $60. To find out how much she spent, we multiply 60 by 1/4:

60 * (1/4) = 60 / 4 = 15

So Maggie spent $15. To find out how much she has left, we subtract 15 from 60:

60 - 15 = 45

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent 1/3 of $60. To find out how much she spent, we multiply 60 by 1/3:

60 * (1/3) = 60 / 3 = 20

So Riza spent $20. To find out how much she has left, we subtract 20 from 60:

60 - 20 = 40

Now, we need to find out how much money they have left in total. We add Maggie's remaining money to Riza's remaining money:

45 + 40 = 85

The final answer is: 85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are 3 monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x (the number of bananas the third monkey eats). However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315. To find the total number of bananas eaten each day, we divide 315 by 7. 

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now we know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas and the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since the total number of bananas eaten each day is 45, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey is 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750. 

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. 

Since roses cost $2 each, the cost of 15 roses would be 15 * 2 = $30. However, since she bought a dozen roses for $15, we need to subtract the cost of the dozen from the total cost of 15 roses. 

The cost of 15 roses - cost of a dozen roses = 15 * 2 - 15 = 30 - 15 = $15. 

However, this is incorrect because we need to calculate the cost of 3 roses that were not part of the dozen. 3 roses would be 3 * 2 = $6. 

So the correct cost of 15 roses is 15 * 2 - 15 + 6 = 30 - 15 + 6 = $21.

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, which is 5 * 5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we need to subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with. 

Change = 25 - 21 = $4.

Since they only have quarters for change, we need to convert the change into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we need to divide the change by 4 to find out how many quarters she gets.

Number of quarters = 4 / 4 = 1.

However, this is incorrect because we need to convert the remaining $0.00 into quarters. Since there is no remaining amount, we can ignore it.

The correct number of quarters is 1."

"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time the third train stays in the station.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes. Since the first train arrives at 10 minutes, Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks she has saved them. 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to save to reach 200 toothpicks. 

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we need to divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect 200 toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

($2000 - $1800) / $2000 * 100 = 10%

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there is 1 jellyfish created per second, the total number of jellyfish created by 1 spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, we multiply this by the number of springs (5) to get the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours.

14400 jellyfish/spring * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to find the total minutes he spends in a day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes in a day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class in a week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is 240 * 7 = 1680 minutes.

Now, we can find the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday: 1/16 * 1680 = 105 minutes.

The total minutes he spends learning in a week is the sum of the minutes he spends in class and the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday: 1200 + 105 = 1305 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1305 / 60 = 21.75 hours.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since they ate the last part, the remaining meat before they ate was 270 kilograms. 

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the remaining meat before the velociraptors ate was twice the amount the Allosaurus ate, which is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat before the T-Rex ate was twice the amount the velociraptors ate. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the remaining meat before the velociraptors ate was twice the amount the T-Rex ate. 

Let's call the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate 'x'. The T-Rex ate half of it, so the remaining meat before the T-Rex ate is x - (x/2) = x/2. 

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the remaining meat before the velociraptors ate is x/2 - (x/4) = x/4. 

We know that the remaining meat before the velociraptors ate is 540 kilograms. So, x/4 = 540. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 540 * 4 = 2160.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of all four walls. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12/gallon = $144.

"To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas left.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 sodas. 

Now, there are 3 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left. Ellen's friend will choose a soda at random from the remaining 9 sodas.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas. 

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
Probability = 3 / 9
Probability = 1/3

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Probability percentage = (1/3) * 100
Probability percentage = 33.33%

"To find the distance traveled by each train, we need to multiply the speed of each train by the time they traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Total distance = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of days Billy works, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works.
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day.
2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day

12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the total number of people in the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the total number of people who attended the ceremony is equal to the total number of people outside the church (in the buses and cars). Therefore, the number of people inside the church is 0.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Now, we multiply the time spent per day by 5 to find the total time spent in 5 days.
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Subtract the cost of the returned item from the initial charge: 
   $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

2. Calculate the discount on the frying pan:
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. 
   20% of $20.00 is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   The sale price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

3. Calculate the discount on the set of towels:
   The set of towels was 10% off $30.00.
   10% of $30.00 is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   The sale price of the set of towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

4. Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance:
   $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is 1/5 of the total number of jellyfish. Let's call the total number of jellyfish ""x"". Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3) * (x/5) = x/15.

3. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. This means that x/15 = 6.

4. To find the total number of jellyfish (x), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15. This gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"

"To calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work, we need to determine how much she needs to save for retirement. 

First, let's calculate her desired retirement income: 
40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement:
$40,000 * 20 years = $800,000.

Next, let's calculate her annual savings:
20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year:
$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement. Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to subtract this from the total number of years:
40 years - 20 years = 20 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years to save for her desired retirement."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into, and then divide that result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into.

First, divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

"To find the total population of the school, we need to use the information that 40% of the population is 240 boys. 

Let's set up the equation: 40% of x = 240, where x is the total population of the school.

To find x, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40/100 = 0.4.

Now, we can rewrite the equation as 0.4x = 240.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4: x = 240 / 0.4.

x = 600.

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population: 600 - 240 = 360.

The number of girls in the school is 360."

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches."
"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target as follows:

Total miles / Total days = Daily target
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of:

125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily hike from her daily target:

Daily target - Planned daily hike = Additional miles per day
310 miles - 250 miles = 60 miles

Let's use the given information: the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can set up a proportion with the number of blinks and the time:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 459 blinks / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

255x = 459 * 5

Now, we can multiply 459 by 5:

255x = 2295

Next, we can divide both sides by 255 to solve for x:

"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of one way and multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per month = 560 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys an hour.
2. Another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys an hour.
3. The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in an hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys.
4. Since all 5 workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.
5. The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, so the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.
6. Since the 4 workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the 5th worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.
7. To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker (180) by the number of hours worked (10): 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to find the weight of each of his dogs and add them together.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. 
One-fourth of 60 is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. 
Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs together: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add Elijah's dogs' weight to Kory's dog's weight: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

2. Since Kris had 16 stickers, and Luis gave them to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers. 
3. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So, Luis had 16 stickers initially, and half of that is 16 / 2 = 8 stickers were used, and the other half (also 8 stickers) were given to Kris. 
4. Luis had 8 stickers initially, and he got them from Seth. So, Seth gave 8 stickers to Luis.
5. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and he had 8 stickers initially. So, Seth had 8 * 2 = 16 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the number of ounces in each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's in each ounce.

Number of large bags: 3
Number of ounces in each bag: 10
Number of M&M's in each ounce: 30

Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30 = 900

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can find the total number of small bags by dividing the total M&M's by 10.

Total small bags = 900 / 10 = 90

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Liam's current age as L and Vince's current age as V.

We know that Liam is 16 years old now, so L = 16.

Two years ago, Liam's age was L - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14.

We are also given that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, we can write the equation:

L - 2 = 2(V - 2)

Substituting L = 16 into the equation, we get:

16 - 2 = 2(V - 2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

14 = 2V - 4

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

18 = 2V

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

V = 9

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that A = M (since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
We know that C + S = 30 (since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
We know that C = S + 12 (since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from the third equation into the second equation:
S + 12 + S = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:
A + M = 2A
We know that A + M + C + S = 56 (since they painted 56 eggs in total)
Substitute the values of C and S:
2A + 21 + 9 = 56
Combine like terms:
2A + 30 = 56
Subtract 30 from both sides:
2A = 26
Divide both sides by 2:
A = 13

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to first find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, we can divide 200 by 8 to find the total number of boxes: 

200 / 8 = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

25 * 8 = 200 ounces

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

200 * 1 = 200 ounces

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16:

400 / 16 = 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we need to divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks is:

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, for a total of 3 miles.
2. Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute, since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk.
3. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, so the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. So, 2 = x * 40. Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
4. Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.
5. The time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes.
6. The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we first need to find out how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we multiply 4 by 8 to find the total amount she has saved so far: 
4 * 8 = 32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. We subtract the amount she has saved so far from the total amount she wants to save: 
60 - 32 = 28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28. We divide 28 by 4 to find the number of weeks:

"Let's denote the number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. 

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. So, the equation becomes x + 24 = 60.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x + 24 - 24 = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now that we know Bob has 36 marbles, if he loses 10 marbles, we can find the number of marbles he will have left by subtracting 10 from 36:

36 - 10 = 26

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the temperatures of the two mugs. 

Since the average temperature is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x ≥ 80

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x ≥ 47

So, the second bottle must be at least 47 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Initial number of cows = 50
Cows brought per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days
Total cows brought = 20 * 21 = 420
Total number of cows = 50 + 420 = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Initial number of chickens = 20
Chickens brought per day = 10
Total chickens brought = 10 * 21 = 210
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210 = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens

"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we need to multiply the cost of one pack by 4. 
Cost of one pack = $10.00
Total cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost.
Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00
Total cost after discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to divide the total cost after discount by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00"

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of green and red jellybeans. 

There are 17 green jellybeans. 
There are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, so there are 2 * 17 = 34 red jellybeans.

The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10 (since a decade has 10 years).

First, let's find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a year:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. We can represent the total number of passengers as 5x + 9x = 14x, where x is a common multiplier. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 14x = 84 and solve for x.

14x = 84
x = 84 / 14
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of women on the bus initially. The number of women is 9x, so 9 * 6 = 54 women.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold as 'x' and the number of bouquets sold as 'y'. 

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold is 12y. 

The total amount earned from sunflowers is $26 per day, and the total amount earned from bouquets is $56 per day. 

We can set up the following system of linear equations:

1) 2x + 8y = 26 (since each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8)
2) 12y = x (since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers)

We can solve the second equation for x: x = 12y.

Now, substitute x in the first equation: 2(12y) + 8y = 26
24y + 8y = 26
32y = 26

Now, divide both sides by 32: y = 26/32
y = 13/16

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x: x = 12y
x = 12 * (13/16)
x = 156/16
x = 9.75

However, since we cannot sell a fraction of a sunflower, we will round down to the nearest whole number. 

The number of sunflowers sold per day is 9.75, so in 3 days, the total number of sunflowers sold is 9.75 * 3 = 29.25. 

Since we cannot sell a fraction of a sunflower, we will round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the inventory and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. 

Cost per rock = $5
Total money = $100
Number of rocks = Total money / Cost per rock
Number of rocks = $100 / $5
Number of rocks = 20

Now, let's find out the total cost of the inventory.

Total cost = Number of rocks * Cost per rock
Total cost = 20 * $5
Total cost = $100

Next, let's find out the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

Number of rocks sold = 60% of 20
Number of rocks sold = 0.6 * 20
Number of rocks sold = 12

Revenue per rock = $7
Total revenue = Number of rocks sold * Revenue per rock
Total revenue = 12 * $7
Total revenue = $84

Now, let's find out the loss.

Loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To find the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

1. For large-sized picture scenes: 
   Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day. 
   To find the number of days it will take her to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, we divide the total number of large-sized picture scenes by the number of large-sized picture scenes she can draw per day: 
   45 / 5 = 9 days.

2. For medium-sized picture scenes: 
   Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day. 
   To find the number of days it will take her to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, we divide the total number of medium-sized picture scenes by the number of medium-sized picture scenes she can draw per day: 
   36 / 6 = 6 days.

3. For small-sized picture scenes: 
   Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. 
   To find the number of days it will take her to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, we divide the total number of small-sized picture scenes by the number of small-sized picture scenes she can draw per day: 
   49 / 7 = 7 days.

The maximum of these values is 9 days, so it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. 

Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x.

Since Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, the number of seashells Jim collected is 2x + 5.

The total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so the total number of seashells is also equal to 3 times the number of seashells each person got: 3 * (number of seashells each person got) = 5x + 5.

We can set up the equation: 3 * (number of seashells each person got) = 5x + 5.

Since there are 3 people, the number of seashells each person got is (5x + 5) / 3.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 2x + 5. We can set up the equation: 2x + 5 = 27.

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 22, x = 11.

Now we can find the number of seashells each person got: (5x + 5) / 3 = (5 * 11 + 5) / 3 = (55 + 5) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find the profit, we first need to find the total revenue and the total cost.

The selling price of each device is twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total revenue is the selling price of each device multiplied by the total number of devices, which is 6 * $40 = $240.

The total cost is the original price of each device multiplied by the total number of devices, which is 6 * $20 = $120.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person. 

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100% / 20% = 5 times the number of bottles.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. Since one person needs 5 times the number of bottles, 2300 people would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the number of bottles needed: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to find the probability of a baby wearing a bow given that they are wearing purple.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Carla dresses 3/4 of the babies in purple, and 1/4 in blue. This means 3/4 of the babies are wearing purple.

2. All the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are blue, 1/4 of the babies are not wearing bows. This means 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the babies are wearing bows.

3. Since 3/4 of the babies are wearing bows, and 1/3 of the purple wearers are wearing bows, we can set up the following equation to find the number of purple babies wearing bows:

   Let P be the total number of purple babies. Then, 1/3 * P is the number of purple babies wearing bows.

4. Since 3/4 of the babies are purple, the number of purple babies is 3/4 of the total number of babies. Let T be the total number of babies. Then, P = 3/4 * T.

5. We know that the total number of babies wearing bows is 3/4 * T, and this is equal to the sum of the number of purple babies wearing bows and the number of blue babies wearing bows. The number of blue babies wearing bows is 1/4 * T (since all blue babies wear bows). So, we can set up the following equation:

   3/4 * T = 1/3 * P + 1/4 * T

6. Substitute P = 3/4 * T into the equation:

   3/4 * T = 1/3 * (3/4 * T) + 1/4 * T

7. Simplify the equation:

   3/4 * T = 1/4 * T + 1/4 * T
   3/4 * T = 1/2 * T

8. Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fractions:

   3T = 2T

9. Subtract 2T from both sides:

   T = 0

However, this is not possible since Carla gave birth to 8 babies. The error occurred because we assumed that the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 of the purple babies, but this is not necessarily true. We should find the number of purple babies wearing bows as a fraction of the total number of babies wearing bows.

10. Let P be the number of purple babies. Then, 1/3 * P is the number of purple babies wearing bows. The total number of babies wearing bows is 3/4 * T, and the number of blue babies wearing bows is 1/4 * T. So, we can set up the following equation:

    1/3 * P + 1/4 * T = 3/4 * T

11. Substitute P = 3/4 * T into the equation:

    1/3 * (3/4 * T) + 1/4 * T = 3/4 * T

12. Simplify the equation:

    1/4 * T + 1/4 * T = 3/4 * T
    1/2 * T = 3/4 * T

13. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fractions:

    T = 3/2 * T

14. Multiply both sides by 2/3 to eliminate the fractions:

    2/3 * T = T

15. Subtract 2/3 * T from both sides:

    1/3 * T = 0

However, this is not possible since Carla gave birth to 8 babies. The error occurred because we assumed that the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 of the purple babies, but this is not necessarily true. We should find the number of purple babies wearing bows as a fraction of the total number of babies wearing bows.

16. Let P be the number of purple babies. Then, 1/3 * P is the number of purple babies wearing bows. The total number of babies wearing bows is 3/4 * T, and the number of blue babies wearing bows is 1/4 * T. So, we can set up the following equation:

    1/3 * P / (1/3 * P + 1/4 * T) = 3/4 / (3/4 * T)

17. Simplify the equation:

    1/3 / (1/3 + 1/4 * T / P) = 3/4 / (3/4)

18. Simplify the equation:

    1/3 / (1/3 + 1/4 * T / (3/4 * T)) = 1

19. Simplify the equation:

    1/3 / (1/3 + 1/3 * T / T) = 1

20. Simplify the equation:

    1/3 / (1/3 + 1/3) = 1

21. Simplify the equation:

    1/3 / (2/3) = 1

22. Simplify the equation:

    1/2 = 1

However, this is not possible. The error occurred because we assumed that the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 of the purple babies, but this is not necessarily true. We should find the number of purple babies wearing bows as a fraction of the total number of babies wearing bows.

23. Let P be the number of purple babies. Then, 1/3 * P is the number of purple babies wearing bows. The total number of babies wearing bows is 3/4 * T, and the number of blue babies wearing bows is 1/4 * T. So, we can set up the following equation:

    (1/3 * P) / (1/3 * P + 1/4 * T) = x

24. Simplify the equation:

    (1/3 * P) / (1/3 * P + 1/4 * T) = x

25. Simplify the equation:

    (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/4 * T / P) = x

26. Simplify the equation:

    (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3 * T / (3/4 * T)) = x

27. Simplify the equation:

    (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/4) = x

28. Simplify the equation:

    (1/3) / (7/12) = x

29. Simplify the equation:

    4/7 = x

30. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to multiply x by 100:

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, let's find out how much land he sold in the first two sales. 

He sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of it is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Then, he sold 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of it is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The total land sold in the first two sales is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's find out how much money he earned from the first two sales. He sold 40 square meters for $50, so the price per square meter is 50 / 40 = $1.25. He sold 20 square meters for $30, so the price per square meter is 30 / 20 = $1.5. The average price per square meter for the first two sales is (1.25 + 1.5) / 2 = $1.375.

The total amount of money he earned from the first two sales is 60 * 1.375 = $82.50.

Now, let's add the money he earned from all three sales: $82.50 + $60 + $50 = $192.50.

The final answer is: $192.50"

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert the dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

The total number of apartments in the last complex is 400 + 240 = 640.

The total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): Let's denote the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as x. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (since the tree doesn't produce any fruit in its 9th year)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. This is also equal to the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree, so we can set up the equation x = 1000.

Now we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as x. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4x.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of the red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the amount of money Ronnie was given is x. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x.

Initially, Ronnie had x dollars and Rissa had 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they each gave y. So, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, let's isolate y:

5y = 15x - 12x
5y = 3x
y = (3/5)x

Now that we know the amount they each gave to their little sister, we can find the amount of money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's money left = x - y
= x - (3/5)x
= (2/5)x

We are not given the value of x, but we can express the answer in terms of x. However, we can also express the answer in terms of the amount Rissa was given, which is 3x. Since Rissa was given 3x and she gave (3/5)x to her little sister, she is left with 4/5 of 3x, which is (4/5)(3x) = (12/5)x. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to his little sister, he is left with (2/5)x.

However, we can also express the answer in terms of the amount Rissa was given, which is 3x. Since Rissa gave (3/5)x to her little sister, she is left with (12/5)x. The ratio of the money left with Ronnie to the money left with Rissa is (2/5)x : (12/5)x, which simplifies to 1 : 6. This means that Ronnie has 1/7 of the total money left, and Rissa has 6/7 of the total money left.

Since Rissa has 6/7 of the total money left, and she has (12/5)x dollars, we can set up the equation:

where T is the total amount of money.

To solve for T, we can multiply both sides by 35/6:

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's represent the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (since 12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of each, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

1. Calculate the area of one bedroom:
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

2. Calculate the area of all 4 bedrooms:
Area of 4 bedrooms = 4 * area of one bedroom = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

3. Calculate the area of the living room:
The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * area of one bedroom = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

4. Calculate the total area of the bedrooms and the living room:
Total area of bedrooms and living room = area of 4 bedrooms + area of living room = 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet

5. Add the area of the rest of the house to the total area of the bedrooms and living room:
Total area of the house = total area of bedrooms and living room + area of the rest of the house = 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the first half.
Team A scores 4 goals in the first half. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

Step 2: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half.

Step 3: Calculate the number of goals scored by team A in the second half.
Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match.
Team A scores 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals.
Team B scores 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount of chalk used each day.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

The teacher now goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. 

To find out how many days the chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day.

20% of 5 inches = 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch

Now, divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day: 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days

The teacher has 2.75 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the rate at which snowballs melt is 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay is building snowballs is the difference between the rate at which he builds them and the rate at which they melt. 

Net rate = (1/3) - (2/15) 
To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. 
Net rate = (5/15) - (2/15) 
Net rate = 3/15 snowballs per minute

Now, we need to find the time it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs at this net rate. 

Time = Total number of snowballs / Net rate 
Time = 60 / (3/15) 
Time = 60 * (15/3) 
Time = 300 minutes

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's assume Jim's age at the time Digimon came out is x. Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, John's age at that time would be 2x.

We know that the time Digimon came out is 20 years ago. So, if John is 28 now, his age 20 years ago would be 28 - 20 = 8.

Since John's age 20 years ago was 8, we can set up the equation 2x = 8 to find Jim's age at that time.

Solving for x, we get x = 8 / 2 = 4.

So, Jim's age at the time Digimon came out was 4. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to 4, which is 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to determine how many slices each person ate and then add them up.

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left at the end of the first day.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They had 12 bandages left from the first day, so they had 12 + 50 (from the new pack) - 28 = 34 bandages left at the end of the second day.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. They had 34 bandages left from the second day, so they had 34 + 100 - 25 = 109 bandages left at the end of the third day.

However, we are told that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, not 109. This means that our initial assumption about the number of bandages they had at the start of the first day must be incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Let's say they started with x bandages. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left at the end of the first day.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They had x + 12 bandages left from the first day, so they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left at the end of the second day.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. They had x - 16 bandages left from the second day, so they had x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left at the end of the third day.

We are told that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, then add them together.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total attendance bonus.

Total hours worked per week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Total earnings without bonus = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen had complete attendance for the month, she will receive an additional $10 for each day. 
Total days in April = 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days
Total attendance bonus = 24 days * $10/day = $240

Total earnings = Total earnings without bonus + Total attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

"To find the total amount Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned in a week and then multiply it by 2 (since it's a two-week period).

In a week, Jason earns:
- $3.00 for doing his laundry
- $1.50 for cleaning his room
- $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb (twice) = $1.50
- $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher (6 times) = $3.00

Total amount in a week = $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00

Since it's a two-week period, we multiply the weekly amount by 2:
$8.00 * 2 = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to find the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, we need to multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks. 

120 gallons (one shark) * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons.

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. 
   Total people so far = 50 + 40 = 90
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch.
   Number of people who entered at 10:00 = 40
   Twice that number = 2 * 40 = 80
   Total people so far = 90 + 80 = 170
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   Number of people who came in first = 50
   Three times that number = 3 * 50 = 150
   Total people so far = 170 + 150 = 320

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:
5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, so the number of black pens is:
2 * 25 = 50 black pens

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of the red and black pens:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we first need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600. 

To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: 
$600 / 10 = $60 per bottle of scotch.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac is 50% more than the cost of scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Day 1:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Day 2:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, so he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Total number of White Oak trees planted in two days: 20 + 30 = 50
Total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted in two days: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140"
"To find the amount of root beer available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents. 

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find the amount each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by 3 (Fred and the 2 other people).

8 gallons / 3 people = 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"

"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had and then subtract the ones she lost or used up.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

In total, Amy lost 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we subtract the ones she lost from the total: 26 - 7 = 19.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we find the height of the two-story house. Since it's 7 times as high as Mattison, we multiply his height by 7:
   60 * 7 = 420 inches

2. The total height of the house is the height of the two-story house plus the height of the first floor. The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so we multiply his height by 3:
   60 * 3 = 180 inches

3. Now, we add the height of the two-story house and the height of the first floor to get the total height of the house:
   420 + 180 = 600 inches

4. Since the two-story house is 420 inches high, the height of the second floor is 420 inches. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house:

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
To multiply a fraction by a number, we multiply the numerator (11) by the number (72) and keep the denominator (8) the same:
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. 
The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 3 * 1 = 3 liters.
He ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 3 * 2 = 6 liters.
He ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 5 * 4 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. 

We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as B = 3C - 2.

We also know that each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which can be written as C + B = 10.

Now we have two equations:

1) B = 3C - 2
2) C + B = 10

We can substitute the value of B from the first equation into the second equation:

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of the nail art is 10 x $3 = $30.

The total cost is the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from the first 3 magazines and the last magazine.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year each, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year."
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, the number of paintings Shelley has is x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so the number of paintings Samantha has is (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 8 - 12 = 27
x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the decrease in January.

Initial price in November: $40
Price increase in December: 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
Price in December: $40 + $32 = $72
Price decrease in January: 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
Price in January: $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons separately, and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%, so his new rate is:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60

He has 2 lessons at this rate, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the amounts earned from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum of the scores by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first find out how many pomelos she had left. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Let x be the number of pomelos Eve gave away.
20 - x = (1/4) * 20

To solve for x, we can multiply 20 by 1/4:
20 - x = 5

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 20 from both sides:
-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1:
x = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"To find the number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. 

Let x be the number of novels Regina wrote this year. 

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year, we can write the equation as:

9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate x:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he travels in 3 days. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael travels for 3 * 24 = 72 hours. 

Now, we multiply his average speed by the total hours traveled: 
50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that he has covered. 

To do this, we divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100: 
(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes initially, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of teachers at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 boxes in a year (52 weeks). 
52 * $1.00 = $52.00

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00. 
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of the cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is the sum of the cost of the pasta and the cheese.
$52.00 + $9.00 = $61.00

The final answer is: $61.00"
"To find the total number of minutes the custodian works in a day, we multiply the number of hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

The total number of minutes the custodian needs to clean all classrooms is the number of classrooms multiplied by the minutes per classroom. 

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we divide the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes worked in a day, and then multiply by 100.

(1200 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms, which is equivalent to 2.5 times their workday."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the total number of books each bookcase can hold and then divide the total number of books by that amount.

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books each bookcase can hold: 
2 middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books
Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total number of books each bookcase can hold is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold to find out how many bookcases she needs:
110 / 55 = 2

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"To find the total cost of the eggs, we need to multiply the cost per dozen by the number of dozens Rose bought. 

Cost per dozen = $2.40
Number of dozens = 5
Total cost = Cost per dozen * Number of dozens
Total cost = $2.40 * 5
Total cost = $12

To find the total number of eggs, we multiply the number of dozens by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).

Number of dozens = 5
Total number of eggs = Number of dozens * 12
Total number of eggs = 5 * 12
Total number of eggs = 60

Now, we need to find the total revenue from selling the eggs. We know that Rose sells 3 eggs for $1. 

Revenue per 3 eggs = $1
Total number of eggs = 60
Number of sets of 3 eggs = Total number of eggs / 3
Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 / 3
Number of sets of 3 eggs = 20

Total revenue = Number of sets of 3 eggs * Revenue per 3 eggs
Total revenue = 20 * $1
Total revenue = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original cost per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Cost after discount: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we multiply the cost by 100.

Cost after discount in cents: $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

Now, we need to find the cost of each stick of jerky. There are 30 sticks in a bag.

Cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. 

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests, we need to find the total number of questions first. The first test has 70 questions and the second test has 40 questions, so the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110.

Now, we can find the total number of questions Audrey needs to get right to pass. 70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77.

Next, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions right, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42.

Now, we can find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test. We subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass: 77 - 42 = 35.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. 

We are given that B = 5S - 4. 

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 15 customers, and then multiply that by 25 to find the total number of calls.

First, we need to find the number of customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car, we can set up a proportion:

1 customer / 2 customers = 15 customers / x customers

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1x = 15 * 2
x = 30

So Jason needs to get 30 customers to sell 15 cars.

Next, we need to find the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers. Since for every 25 telephone calls he makes, he gets one person to come into the car dealership, we can set up a proportion:

1 customer / 25 calls = 30 customers / x calls

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1x = 30 * 25
x = 750

So Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's find the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to find the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

So, the cost of each additional phone is $10.

Since there are 4 additional phones, the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = cost of main phone + cost of additional phones
Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining four days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining four days, the total number of people he saw on those days is 60 * 4 = 240.

"To find the total number of pieces of popcorn, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and then add them together.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 
Total lemonade = 4 gallons (for the party) + 1 gallon (for Allen) = 5 gallons

Step 2: Since the recipe calls for 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, we need to find out how many cups of lemon juice are needed for 5 gallons of lemonade.
Total lemon juice needed = 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Step 3: Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice 1 lemon yields.
1 lemon = 1 cup / 6 lemons = 1/6 cup per lemon

Step 4: Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice.
Total lemons needed = 5 cups / (1/6 cup/lemon) = 5 * 6 = 30 lemons

However, we also need to make an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice.
Extra lemon juice needed = 2 cups (since 1 cup is needed for the other gallons)

Step 5: We need to add the extra lemon juice to the total amount of lemon juice needed.
Total lemon juice needed = 5 cups + 2 cups = 7 cups

Step 6: Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for 7 cups of juice.
Total lemons needed = 7 cups / (1/6 cup/lemon) = 7 * 6 = 42 lemons

"To find the total number of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs for 2-legged animals and 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs
For 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs of legs

"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

"To find the distance traveled in the first part of the journey, we multiply the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

To find the distance traveled in the second part of the journey, we multiply the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. The eastward distance cancels out the westward distance, so we subtract the westward distance from the eastward distance: 
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

The bag has 54 red candies. It has twice that amount of orange candies, so the number of orange candies is 54 * 2 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find out how much feed is left, we need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed they eat per day is 5 * 8 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the pigs eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

First, we calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the guests: 
20 guests * 2 hot dogs per guest = 40 hot dogs

Since John already has 4 hot dogs left over, we need to add those to the total: 
40 hot dogs + 4 hot dogs = 44 hot dogs

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. 
Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6: 
44 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 7.33 packs

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, John will need to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how much John needs to spend on hot dogs.

We are given the following information:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: T = 16 / 2 = 8
2. Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: P = 14 + 2 = 16
3. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29: T + B + P = 29

Substituting the values of T and P into the third equation, we get:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

From point 1, if Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, then if Vanessa runs x miles in y minutes, Aaron runs 2x miles in y/2 minutes.

From point 2, since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron must have run 4/2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can set up the equation 2x / (y/2) = 2 / 16, where 2x is the distance Aaron runs and y/2 is the time it takes him to run that distance.

However, we know that 2x = 2 miles (from point 2), so we can simplify the equation to 2 / (y/2) = 2 / 16.

To solve for y, we can cross-multiply: 2 * 16 = 2 * (y/2), which simplifies to 32 = y.

So, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Now, we subtract the amount of line he already has:
600 feet (required) - 6 feet (already has) = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue calculation:
- Number of reservations: 6
- Meals per reservation: 2
- Cost per meal: $5
- Total meal cost per reservation: 2 * $5 = $10
- Bottle of wine per reservation: $5
- Total cost per reservation: $10 + $5 = $15
- Daily revenue: 6 reservations * $15 = $90

Weekly revenue calculation:
- Number of days open: 2
- Daily revenue: $90
- Weekly revenue: 2 * $90 = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of watermelons. 

Total cost = $80
Number of watermelons = 50

Cost per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost per watermelon = $1.60

Since the vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit, we need to find the selling price. 

Profit percentage = 25%
Profit = Cost price * Profit percentage
Profit = $1.60 * 0.25
Profit = $0.40

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
Selling price = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. John had a son James when he was 19. This means James is currently 19 + x years old, where x is the number of years that have passed since John had James.
2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is currently 2 * (12 + 3) = 30 years old.
3. Since James is 30 years old now, and he was born when John was 19, John is currently 30 + 19 = 49 years old.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means the youngest son is currently 49 - 32 = 17 years old.
5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 17 + 3 = 20 years old.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to find out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour and then subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the cost of the radiator, we need to calculate 80% off the original price. 

80% off of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320.

The cost of the radiator at the junk shop is $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic's labor cost is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of linear equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of C the same in both equations:

2C + 2W = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Now we can solve for W:

W = 30 / 2
W = 15

Now that we know W, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for C:

C + 15 = 20
C = 20 - 15
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices: 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is: 14"
