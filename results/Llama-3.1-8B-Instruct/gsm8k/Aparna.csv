"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we have:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to get the total:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's find the value of the repairs in terms of the original value of the house. If the original value is 100%, then the increase is 150%. So, the total value after repairs is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original value.

Now, we can find the total value after repairs: 
Total value after repairs = 2.5 * original value = 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000

The cost of the house was $80,000 and the cost of repairs was $50,000. So, the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The profit is the difference between the total value after repairs and the total cost:
Profit = Total value after repairs - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of times he does it in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to find out the total number of cups of feed she gives to her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, we subtract the total number of cups of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. 

60 - 40 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * 3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

So, the cost of the glasses can be calculated as follows:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $1.8.
- The fourth glass costs $1.8 * 0.6 = $1.08.
- The fifth glass costs $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.648.
- The sixth glass costs $0.648 * 0.6 = $0.3888.
- The seventh glass costs $0.3888 * 0.6 = $0.23328.
- The eighth glass costs $0.23328 * 0.6 = $0.139968.
- The ninth glass costs $0.139968 * 0.6 = $0.083981.
- The tenth glass costs $0.083981 * 0.6 = $0.0503886.
- The eleventh glass costs $0.0503886 * 0.6 = $0.03023316.
- The twelfth glass costs $0.03023316 * 0.6 = $0.018139896.
- The thirteenth glass costs $0.018139896 * 0.6 = $0.0108839376.
- The fourteenth glass costs $0.0108839376 * 0.6 = $0.00653036256.
- The fifteenth glass costs $0.00653036256 * 0.6 = $0.00391821736.
- The sixteenth glass costs $0.00391821736 * 0.6 = $0.002360930416.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the glasses:
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.083981 + $0.0503886 + $0.03023316 + $0.018139896 + $0.0108839376 + $0.00653036256 + $0.00391821736 + $0.002360930416 = $17.016

The total cost of the glasses is $17.016."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download.

First, let's find the time taken for the first part of the download. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. The file is 200 GB, so the time taken for the first part of the download is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

40% of the way through the download is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. So, Carla has downloaded 80 GB in 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

The time taken for the restart is given as 20 minutes.

Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the entire 200 GB again. The time taken for the second part of the download is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download. 

Total time = 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in those 4 hours.

First, let's break down the time into segments:

1. 3 hours at 60 mph: distance = speed * time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles
2. 2 hours in standstill traffic: distance = 0 miles (since he didn't move)
3. 0.5 hours at 30 mph: distance = speed * time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles
4. 1.5 hours at 80 mph: distance = speed * time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, let's add up the distances:
180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

However, this is the total distance John traveled in the 4 hours. Since he started at home and ended up back at home, we need to subtract the initial distance he traveled from home to find the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

The initial distance he traveled from home is 180 miles. 

So, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
315 - 180 = 135 miles

The final answer is: 135"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, and then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

Her earnings for this week are $460."
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them up.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add up the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We set up the equation:

7.5x = 90

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 7.5:

x = 90 / 7.5
x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for the tree to start earning money on itself, but since the question asks for when it starts earning money, we need to consider the year it starts generating a profit after the initial investment. Therefore, the answer is 13 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. 
   Let's assume she started with 'x' vacuum cleaners. 
   So, she sold x/3 at the green house.

2. She sold 2 more at the red house. 
   Now, she has x - x/3 = 2/3x vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. 
   Half of 2/3x is (1/2) * (2/3)x = 1/3x. 
   So, she sold 1/3x at the orange house.

4. Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. 
   This means, 2/3x - 1/3x = 5. 
   Simplifying this, we get 1/3x = 5. 
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Students enrolled in jazz dance = 4
Remaining students (enrolled in hip-hop dance) = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100
= 0.6 * 100
= 60%

"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item that will increase in value the most. 

First, let's calculate the increase in value for each item:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the trains are traveling in two different directions, so we can't simply add the distances. We need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train.

Let's break it down:

Day 1: Both trains travel 80 miles westward. 

Day 2: Both trains travel 150 miles northward.

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's denote the distance covered by each train as 'd'. We can form a right-angled triangle with the westward distance (80 miles) and the northward distance (150 miles) as the two sides, and the total distance covered by each train as the hypotenuse.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:

d^2 = 80^2 + 150^2
d^2 = 6400 + 22500
d^2 = 28100
d = sqrt(28100)
d = 167.3 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is approximately 167.3 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a teacher in a year is 35 * 50 = 1750 hours.
Her hourly wage as a teacher is $20, so her total earnings from teaching in a year is 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a coach in a year is 15 * 50 = 750 hours.
Her hourly wage as a coach is $30, so her total earnings from coaching in a year is 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and then multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 3 x 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa wants to take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Since Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 2 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

Speed = 2 miles / 1 hour = 2 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the non-water content in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the remaining two-fifths is non-water. So, the non-water content in the pineapple drink is 15 - 9 = 6 liters.

Now, we have 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink. But we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. So, the remaining amount of orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the orange drink after spilling 1 liter is 6.67 - (1 * (3.33/10)) = 6.67 - 0.33 = 6.34 liters.

The total amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 6.34 + 9 = 15.34 liters.

The final answer is: 15.34"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Samantha is now 31 years old.
3. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.
4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so the son is 25 - 23 = 2 years younger than Raymond.
5. Since the son is 2 years younger than Raymond, and Raymond is 25 years old now, the son is 25 - 2 = 23 years old now.
6. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we need to subtract his current age from the current year. However, we don't know the current year, but we can find the difference in their ages which will remain constant. 
7. Since Samantha is 31 years old, and she is 6 years younger than Raymond, the current year is 31 + 6 = 37.
8. The son is 23 years old now, so he was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 5 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

Since the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, we don't need to add anything to the total.

So, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a total of 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting: 
4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's assume the original price of the book is x.

Since there's a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of x, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the items excluding pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Now, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza cost $17. Each box costs $8.50, so the number of boxes is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide the total number of days by the number of servings per carton:

60 days / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the total number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 from 60. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

20 miles (first stop) - 45 miles (distance from second stop to the end) is not correct, as that would be the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. We need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. 

To do this, we can subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance of the first stop, but we need to add the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip to the distance of the first stop to get the total distance of the trip, then subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the total distance of the trip. 

60 miles (total trip) - 45 miles (distance from second stop to the end) = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. To find the distance from the first stop to the second stop, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop from the distance of the first stop. 

The distance from the first stop to the second stop is 20 miles (first stop) - x miles (distance from the first stop to the second stop) = 60 miles (total trip) - 45 miles (distance from second stop to the end of the trip).

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the cost of the cheaper pair of heels be x dollars. 
The cost of the more expensive pair of heels is 2x dollars. 
The total cost of the two pairs of heels is x + 2x = 3x dollars. 
The total cost of the two pairs of heels is five dollars less than the boots, so the cost of the boots is 3x + 5 dollars. 
We also know that one pair of heels costs $33, which is the cheaper pair. 
So, x = 33 dollars. 
Now, we can find the cost of the boots by substituting the value of x into the equation for the cost of the boots: 
Cost of boots = 3x + 5 
Cost of boots = 3(33) + 5 
Cost of boots = 99 + 5 
Cost of boots = 104 dollars.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age now is 162, we can set up the equation:
7x + 11x = 162
Combine like terms:
18x = 162
Divide both sides by 18:
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.
There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

He has 10 dogs and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. 

Total hours per day = 10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week.

Total hours per week = 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. G = 40 + 30 = 70.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how many yogurts he eats in 30 days. 

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, Terry spends 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent on video games is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. So, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. However, we already know he made $195 from selling the Lego sets, and we know he had $165 before buying the video games. This means he must have spent $195 - $165 = $30 on something else before buying the video games.

However, we know he had $5 left after buying the video games, and he spent $160 on video games. This means he must have had $5 + $160 = $165 before buying the video games. This is consistent with our previous calculation.

Since he spent $30 on something else before buying the video games, and we know he sold 13 Lego sets for $195, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold for $30 by dividing $30 by $15. This is $30 / $15 = 2.

So, John sold 2 Lego sets for $30, and he sold the remaining 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets for $195 - $30 = $165.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time in hours and then divide the total distance by that time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total hours run per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Since John runs 60 miles a week and runs for 6 hours a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's walking speed first. Since she can skip at half the speed of running and skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. 

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the time she spends walking and running. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. However, we need to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames. 

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, let's subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests.

"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can have by the total weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 300g = 240g

"To find the net profit, we first need to find the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of supplies for 20 candles is the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks, since 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. 
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks = $10.00 * 2 = $20.00

The total revenue from selling 20 candles is the selling price of each candle multiplied by the number of candles sold.
Total revenue = $2.00 * 20 = $40.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

Now, let's find the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the remaining lollipops are 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags she can fill.

28 / 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags."

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total cost after the delivery vendor's fee and the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

First, let's calculate the delivery vendor's fee, which is 25% of the final bill of $40.00. 
25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Now, let's add the delivery vendor's fee to the final bill.
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Next, let's add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the total.
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, let's add the $4.00 tip to the total.
$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters of 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10). For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

The value of the pension for 10 years is 10 * $50,000 = $500,000.

For the remaining 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000.

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Amount paid for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126

The amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year is $126.

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year to find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon

- At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100.

To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount she has:

$100 (total amount) - $40 (total allowance) = $60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes a day for 5 weekdays, which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes. 
She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost per flower of each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better deal.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages of 2 flowers * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive price.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first calculate her salary after 5 years of service and then calculate the increase in salary for the next 3 years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase in salary after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase in salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

Increase in salary after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726

Increase in salary after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Increase in salary after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests who don't show up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to find the number of doorbell rings made by each friend and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings made by each friend: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average in one day, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, let's add the glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26 glasses of water.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city. 

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many pieces Poppy placed, we need to calculate a quarter of 1000. 

A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250 pieces. 

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. 

A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250 pieces. 

750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box and then multiply the resulting dimensions.

The length of the inner box is 5 - 2*1 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side)
The width of the inner box is 6 - 2*1 = 4 inches
The height of the inner box is 4 - 2*1 = 2 inches

Now, we multiply these dimensions to find the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:
Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights * 1 hour/night = 2 hours
- Wednesday: Let's assume x 30-minute episodes were watched. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time spent watching on Wednesday is 30x minutes.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours

Total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:
30x + 5.5 = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
30x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 30:
x = 0.05

Since x represents the number of 30-minute episodes, we need to convert it to a whole number. However, the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes, and 0.05 is equivalent to 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 * 10 = 1/10 * 10 = 1/10 * 10 = 1 * 1 = 1 * 0.1 * 10 = 1 * 10/10 = 1 * 10/10 = 1 * 1 = 1 *

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the number of cookies Henry baked last year is x.
2. This year, he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.
6. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback rewards are $.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback rewards = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback rewards = $.20 * 10
Total cashback rewards = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback rewards
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-up: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-up: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both of them. 
Total roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people).
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how many seconds it takes her to row 10 feet by dividing 16 by 2. This is 16 / 2 = 8 seconds. 

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet she rows in 64 seconds by dividing 64 by 8. This is 64 / 8 = 8 sets of 10 feet.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rows 8 sets of 10 feet, the boat takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each having 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue from selling all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. 

Let x be the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. Then, the number of cups of water used is 120 - x.

We know that the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so we can set up the following proportion:

7/13 = x / (120 - x)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

7(120 - x) = 13x

Expanding the equation, we get:

840 - 7x = 13x

Adding 7x to both sides, we get:

840 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 = $120. 

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

So, John paid $360."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The next day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary was 1.3x.

We are also given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% over four years, we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000 / 1.4 (to find the original salary, we divide by 1.4 because 100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4)

1.3x = 40000 / 1.4
1.3x = 28571.43
x = 28571.43 / 1.3
x = 22000

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $22000.

Now, we need to find their salaries four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
40000 * 1.4 = 56000

Lylah's salary increased by 40% as well, so her new salary is:
22000 * 1.4 = 30800

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
56000 + 30800 = 86800

The final answer is: $86800"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first find out how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sheets Miguel uses in a month is:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we add the total number of fruits each person brought: 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27. 

The final answer is: 27"

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs in the first 3 hours and the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles

Total distance covered in 7 hours = Distance in first 3 hours + Distance in remaining 4 hours
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Initially, Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. 

One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. 

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. 

Now, there are 60 - 20 = 40 letters left that need stamps. 

We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. 

This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters. 

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie started stamping is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, she had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, let's add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to find out how many friends Amy has. 

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have. 
Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to find the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, let's find the cost of an orange. Since an orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to multiply the number of patients by the average time each patient is seen. 

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150/hour, so the total cost is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

The hospital charges the patients $200/hour, so the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost:

$40000 - $30000 = $10000

The hospital makes $10000 in profit from these visits."
"To find out how many elves are left, we first need to calculate how many elves quit after the children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we divide 60 by 3.

60 / 3 = 20 elves quit after the children vomit on them.

Now, we subtract the elves who quit from the total number of elves to find out how many are left.

60 - 20 = 40 elves left

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these 10 elves from the remaining 40.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the first test = Total questions / Rate = 75 / 5 = 15 hours. 
Since Mark only had 8 hours, he completed 8/15 of the first test. 
Questions completed in the first test = (8/15) * 75 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the second test = Total questions / Rate = 100 / 5 = 20 hours. 
Since Mark only had 6 hours, he completed 6/20 of the second test. 
Questions completed in the second test = (6/20) * 100 = 30 questions.

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let the number of baby bees be x.
- Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x.
- There are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2.
- The total number of bees is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 1400.

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400.

Now, divide both sides by 7: x = 200.

Since the number of worker bees is 2x, we can find the number of worker bees by multiplying 2 and 200: 2 * 200 = 400.

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

"I think there's been a mistake in the question. It says ""Kim has started his own housekeeping business"" but then later refers to ""Lucas."" I'll assume the correct name is Kim.

To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need for all 8 clients (3 current clients + 5 potential clients). Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16 and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 bees returned, so the number of bees that have left and not returned is 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, and 15 bees returned in the last 6 hours. So, the number of bees that have left and not returned is 90 (total left) - 30 (returned) = 60 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 30 bees return.

Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, then we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has 'x'. 

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation: 3x = 12. 

To find the value of 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. 

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook. 

Now, we know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can multiply 4 by 4 to find out how many friends James has. 

James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 440 feet per minute. 

Time taken by Steve to get home = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve to get home = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve to get home = 12 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 10560 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim to get home = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim to get home = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim to get home = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. 

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Time difference = Time taken by Tim to get home - Time taken by Steve to get home
Time difference = 40 - 12

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'x'. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30.
   The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3)(x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Solving for x, we get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the total hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:
1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:
3360 / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed for 2 months: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Brooke's current age is x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2, and Seth's age will be 2x + 2.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write an equation based on this information:

Combine like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x, which is 2(8) = 16.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of white carnations is 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

The number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, which is 5x. However, we are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. So, we can set up the equation 5x = 200.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes.

The favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes.

The total number of outcomes is 6, since there are 6 sides on the die.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes.

The favorable outcomes for rolling two even numbers in a row are 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6. There are 8 favorable outcomes.

The total number of outcomes is 6^2 = 36, since there are 6 sides on the die and we are rolling it twice.

So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 8/36 = 2/9 ≈ 0.2222 or 22.22%.

Now, to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

Difference in probability = 0.5 - 0.2222 = 0.2778

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Difference in probability = 0.2778 * 100 = 27.78%

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. So, the total number of straw pieces given to rats and hamsters is 160. 

We can write the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r'. 

18r = 160 - 50
18r = 110
r = 110 / 18
r = 110 / (2 * 9)
r = 55 / 9
r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. 

Let's try r = 6: 
18 * 6 = 108 (less than 110)
Let's try r = 7: 
18 * 7 = 126 (greater than 110)

Since 108 is less than 110 and 126 is greater than 110, the number of rats in each cage must be between 6 and 7. However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we can try r = 6.11, which is not a whole number, but we can round it to the nearest whole number. 

However, since we are given that the rats are kept in equal groups, we can try r = 6 and see if it satisfies the equation. 

18 * 6 = 108 (less than 110)
Since 108 is less than 110, we can try r = 7. 

However, we can also try to find the remainder when 110 is divided by 18. 

110 / 18 = 6 with a remainder of 2. 

So, 110 is 6 * 18 + 2. 

Now, let's try r = 6: 
18 * 6 = 108 (less than 110)
Let's try r = 6 + 1/18: 
18 * (6 + 1/18) = 18 * 6 + 1 = 110

So, the number of rats in each cage is 6 + 1/18, but since the number of rats must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number."
"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to first find out how many minutes he collects peaches for. Since he collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches a minute. So, in 180 minutes, he will collect 2 x 180 = 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, subtract the trees that die, and then add the initial number of trees.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net change) = 130 trees.

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, let's break down the events:

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos is 6 (white) + 30 (pink) = 36.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Since she can buy 10 crayons and she needs 5 different colors, she will buy 2 of each color. 

Now, let's find out how much change she will get. 

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - (2 * 5 * $2)
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

So, Violetta will get $0 change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.
- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
- Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, so he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Now, let's calculate Mark's earnings from each publisher:

- From Publisher A: 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents
- From Publisher B: 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Total earnings = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise: 
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100

New salary = old salary + raise = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John gets a weekly salary, we need to multiply his new salary by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks). 
Total weekly income = 2100 * 52 = 109200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total income.
Total income = 109200 + 5000 = 114200

However, since the award was given on the first day of the year, John would have earned his new salary for 51 weeks (since he already earned his old salary for the first week of the year). 
Corrected total income = (2100 * 51) + 5000 = 107100 + 5000 = 111100

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For sandwiches: Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. 
Total slices used for sandwiches = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

For omelets: Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days in the week and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. 
Total slices used for omelets = 3 days * (2 + 1) slices/day = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

For macaroni and cheese: Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together:
Total slices used = 14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6
Total score needed = 558

Next, we add up the scores of the first five tests and subtract the lowest score to get the total score of the remaining four tests.

Scores of the first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
Scores of the first five tests = 338

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five tests. The lowest score is 71.

Total score of the remaining four tests = Scores of the first five tests - lowest score
Total score of the remaining four tests = 338 - 71
Total score of the remaining four tests = 267

Now, we add the score of the sixth test to the total score of the remaining four tests to get the total score needed.

Total score needed = Total score of the remaining four tests + score of the sixth test
558 = 267 + score of the sixth test

To find the score of the sixth test, we subtract 267 from 558.

Score of the sixth test = 558 - 267
Score of the sixth test = 291

The weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

First, let's simplify the equation:

240x = 36000 - 1200

Now, let's subtract 1200 from 36000:

240x = 34800

Next, let's divide both sides by 240 to find the value of x:

x = 34800 / 240

"To find out how much money Sara needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much more money she needs: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

To find out how much more she needs to earn from mowing the lawn, we subtract the amount she earns from babysitting from the total amount she needs: $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns per mowing: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total customers by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total customers by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
= 500 - (100 + 150)

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago is x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, each pool will lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. 

Now, to find the amount of water in the small pool now, we subtract the 16 gallons that leaked out:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons

Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 * 2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the interest she will pay each month is $200 - $165 = $35. 

Now, let's find the total interest she will pay over 12 months. $35 * 12 = $420.

Now, let's find the total amount she will pay. $2000 (initial amount) + $420 (interest) = $2420.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored.

The total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (bus to Rochester) + 3 (car from Rochester) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to find the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 

After losing 8 water type, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (number of water type cards / total number of cards) * 100.

Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito is $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal so far is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to calculate their combined rate. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute. 

So, their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to follow the steps below:

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36. 
So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest, and 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 is 0.75 * 84 = 63. 
So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest, and 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

The total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for the cars are 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000."
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2. 

25 * 2 = 50

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, and there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25

Now, we can find the total number of insects by adding the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave, and then subtract that from the total number of penguins.

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave, which is also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the group of penguins sunbathing.

So, the number of penguins left sunbathing is 36 - 24 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 days in a week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half the amount he does. 

6 tomatoes/day / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend's consumption)

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend's weekly consumption)

Total weekly consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend is 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes per vine to find out how many vines are needed.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 / 8 = 10

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To find the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys.

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the first set of 25 pens.

Now, these 5 new pens will also run out of ink, and he can use their ink to make more pens. So, from these 5 new pens, he can make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

Now, he has a total of 5 + 1 = 6 pens. These 6 pens will also run out of ink, and he can use their ink to make more pens. So, from these 6 pens, he can make 6 / 5 = 1.2 new pens. However, since you can't make a fraction of a pen, we'll round down to 1 pen.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, each 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he sends is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 (pages received) + 30 (pages sent) = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the cost for each day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since she needs it done 4 times a week, the cost for each week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: $30,000 * 0.1 = $3000.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on party supplies. 

Total amount spent = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total amount spent = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total amount spent = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Amount each person paid = Total amount spent / Number of people
Amount each person paid = $96 / 3
Amount each person paid = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, 
Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

The total number of girls in the first and second class is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

Now, we know that the total number of girls in the school is 30, and the total number of girls in the first and second class is 27. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of students in the third class is 20, and the number of girls in the third class is 3. So, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"Let's break down the information given:

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. 

However, we already know that the number of cougars killed today is 12, so we don't need to use x. 

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today. 

Total animals killed = (10 + 15) + (3 * 12) + 12
Total animals killed = 25 + 36 + 12
Total animals killed = 73

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, 30% less than 30 is 30 - 9 = 21. 

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 10 = 4.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she is making.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

In total, Carla will need 6 cups of flour for today and 5 cups of flour for tomorrow, which is 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300. 

To calculate this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

9,300 * 2 = 18,600 

18,600 / 3 = 6,200 

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

In 9 years, Sam's age will be x + 9 and Ruby's age will be 6x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:
3x + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 6

So, Sam's current age is 6 years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the cobra has twice as many spots as the mamba. Since the cobra has 70 spots, the mamba must have half the number of spots, which is 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we need to find the total number of spots on all the snakes. There are 40 cobras with 70 spots each, so the total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. There are 60 mambas with 35 spots each, so the total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots on all the snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the total number of stars on the flag is 76, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. 

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance:
Time = Distance / Speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

(1/10)x = 39
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available in total, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet. 

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets.

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children.

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get.

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
So, the total points of all three players is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83. 

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will buys 15 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of activities for each day and then add them together.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total activities for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
Total activities for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total count of activities in two days: 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals a day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 * 5 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 21 days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates. 

Number of working days = 7 - 2 = 5

Target for 5 working days = 120 / 7 * 5 = 85.71 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will consider the target for 5 working days as 85 crates.

Now, let's find out how many crates Sam was off from his target:

Crates off from target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

So, Sam was 20 crates off from his target for the week."
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. The bids rise by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, there are a total of 4 people who bid before Carmen wins. 

The bids will be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, and $450. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 4 times. The bids will be: $450, $500, $550, $600.

The total cost of the desk is the last bid made by Carmen, which is $600. 

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus given.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. 
   He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15000 * $2 = $30000.

3. Total bonus given: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus given per year is $150 * 12 = $1800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus given, which is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged after folding. 

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides after unfolding. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider it as two 16-page sections: the left section and the right section. 

Each section will have 16 pages, but since the pages are printed on both sides, we need to consider the number of pages that can be printed on each piece of paper. 

For the left section, we have pages 1-16, and for the right section, we have pages 17-32. 

However, when we fold the paper, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page of the left section is on the left back, and the second page is on the left front. This means that the first page of the left section is shared with the last page of the right section, and the second page of the left section is shared with the first page of the right section.

So, we can consider the left section as having 16 pages (1-16) and the right section as having 15 pages (17-31). 

Since each piece of paper can have two pages printed on it, we need 16 pieces of paper for the left section and 16 pieces of paper for the right section.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 16 + 16 = 32."
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we can calculate this as:

$50 / 2 = $25

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. 

Total amount spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total amount spent) = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total books = 250
2. Unsold books = 50
3. Books sold this year = 45
4. Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
5. Books sold in the second year = Total books - (Unsold books + Books sold this year + Books sold in the first year) 
   = 250 - (50 + 45 + 90) 
   = 250 - 185 
   = 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. So, his total hours worked in a week is 10 * 5 = 50 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage is 50 * $10 = $500.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. 

There are 4 weeks in April. So, his total bonus for the month is 4 * $300 = $1200.

His total earnings for the month is the sum of his weekly earnings and his total bonus, which is $500 + $1200 = $1700.

Therefore, Watson made $1700 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

"To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks by 4. 

Weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight lost by Joey in 1 week = 8 / 4 = 2 pounds

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds per week.

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks by the weight lost by Sandy in a week.

Weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks = 8 pounds
Weight lost by Sandy in a week = 2 pounds
Time taken by Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks = 8 / 2 = 4 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
So, the savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
So, the savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount he has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the total amount spent so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has a total of $6000 - $2000 = $4000 to spend on the trip.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent so far from the total amount available for spending:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Let the number of players on the defense be D.
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's 2D.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is 105. 

So, we can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7: D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. 

Total number of people at the beginning = 25 + 15 = 40

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. 
1/4 of 40 = 40 * 1/4 = 10

So, 10 people left the party. 

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, let's find the number of women who left. 
Total people left = 10
Men left = 3
Women left = Total people left - Men left = 10 - 3 = 7

Initially, there were 15 women. 
Women left = 7
So, the number of women who stayed at the party = 15 - 7 = 8

"Let's break down the problem. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box. 

To find the number of pencils in each box, we need to solve for x. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24. 

Now, divide both sides by 3: x = 24 / 3, x = 8. 

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils they have is 24 + 46 = 70 pencils. 

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 / 8 = 8.75. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's add the effect of the cream. The coffee is already 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, and then 15 milliliters of cream is added, making it 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out the ratio of old records to new records. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the ratio is 2:1.

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say the number of new records each person gets is x. Then, the total number of new records is 5x = 7.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 7/5 = 1.4. However, since we can't have a fraction of a record, this means that each person gets 1 new record and 2 people get an extra record, making a total of 7 new records.

Now, we know that each person gets 1 new record, so the total number of new records is 5. Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, the total number of old records is twice the number of new records. 

So, the total number of old records is 5 * 2 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000."
"Let's break down the information given:

- At the first bus stop, 5 people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 people got in.
- At the third stop, there were a total of 20 people.

Initially, let's assume the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 'x'.

After the first stop, the total number of people on the bus is x + 5.

After the second stop, the total number of people on the bus is (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x - 7 + 8 = x + 1.

We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people. So, we can set up the equation: x + 1 = 20.

To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation: x + 1 = 20.

x = 20 - 1
x = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. 

1. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school: 24 - 2 = 22
2. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: 22 - 14 = 8
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28. So, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night: 36 - 3 = 33
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning: 33 - 2 = 31

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she had after her mother gave her 10 more. 

Erin initially had 7 lollipops. Her mother gave her 10 more, so she now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gave 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops she has left, we subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and apply the coupon.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price.

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The customer paid $43 - $12 = $31 on this shopping trip.

"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total income and then subtract the taxes. 

Job A's total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. 
The state tax rate is 20%, so the taxes for Job A are $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. 
The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we first need to subtract the property tax from the total income. 
The property tax is $6,000, so the income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. 
The state tax rate is 10%, so the taxes for Job B are $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. 
The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: 
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of all Maria's shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200. Since the class is split into 3 groups, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the last group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

So, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's assume the number of cows is 'x'. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x (since he has twice as many chickens as cows).

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2(20) = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.

Total legs of cows = 20 * 4 = 80
Total legs of chickens = 40 * 2 = 80

Total legs of all animals = 80 + 80 = 160

So, Josh is left with 7 - 1 = 6 balls to juggle on stage."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

Weight of the pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of the blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of the green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of the yellow snake = 60 pounds

"To find the percentage increase, we first need to find the difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of go-karts is 2 rides * $10 * (x + 1) because Morgan is also riding the go-karts.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. 

Total cost = $5 * (x + 1) + $5 + 2 * $10 * (x + 1)
Total cost = $5x + $5 + $5 + $20x + $20
Total cost = $25x + $30

We know that the total budget is $90. So, we can set up the equation:

Now, we can solve for x:

$25x = $90 - $30
$25x = $60
x = $60 / $25
x = 2.4

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles

Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day = 225 * 3 = 675 miles

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles).

Number of days between services = 18,000 / 675 = 26.67

Since the train can't travel a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of days it goes between services, so we will round down to 26 days."

"To find the total number of kids in the park, we first need to find the number of boys. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, we multiply the number of girls by 2.

Number of girls = 6
Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we add the number of girls and boys to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total kids = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total kids = 6 + 12
Total kids = 18

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we need to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. 
   Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as O. 
   The total number of people kicked out is the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons.
   3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50
   31 + O = 50
   O = 50 - 31
   O = 19

"Let's break down the information given. 

Erin now has 14 points. Sara has 8 points. Erin has three times more points than Sara, which means Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points more than Sara. 

Since Erin has 14 points now, and she has 24 points more than Sara, we can set up an equation to find out how many points Erin had before. Let's call the number of points Erin had before 'x'. 

The equation would be: x + 24 = 14 (since Erin had 24 more points than Sara, and now she has 14 points)

To find 'x', we need to subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 14 - 24
x = -10

So, Erin had -10 points before."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, let's calculate the cost of etching the logo on the picture frames. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of each picture frame. 20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching the logo on all the picture frames is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost. $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the cost of the materials. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the cost of the materials would be the original cost minus the savings, which is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday, which is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

She started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. After feeding her 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. 

6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we first need to find the number of pupils who like blue and green.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

So, the number of pupils who like green is 5.

The number of pupils who like yellow is the total number of pupils minus the number of pupils who like blue and green. This is 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

The formula to calculate simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
= $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
= $5,475 / 5
= $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time she hiked. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. 

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since Millie sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is the number of cups multiplied by the price per cup.

36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Millie spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is the total revenue minus the cost of supplies.

Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Supplies
Profit = $36 - $18
Profit = $18

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find the profit per hour. 

Profit per hour = Total Profit / Total Hours
Since she sells all the lemonade, the total hours will be the total cups divided by the cups sold per hour.
Total Hours = 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours
Profit per hour = $18 / 9 hours
Profit per hour = $2

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the initial amount of land is x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To find out how much money David saves, we first need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. 

The cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is $36, and the cost for David to ride all 9 rides is $30. 

The difference in cost is $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets for all 9 rides.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 
5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: 
x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. 
Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles
Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 
90 - 75 = 15

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"

30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked for 40 hours at $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600. 

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $600 per employee = $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

Each of the remaining employees worked for 40 hours at $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 employees * $600 per employee = $18,000.

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can break it down as follows:

- 1 pound at $3
- 1/2 pound at $1.50 (since 1/2 pound is half the price of 1 pound)

So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:

- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1
- Total cost: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount:

$10 - $7 = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework. 

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. 

The cost of the fireworks after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960. 

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since she eats 2 cookies a night, in 30 days she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens.

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a 1% chance of exploding. However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, and the remaining 95% are the ones that are more dangerous but do not smell like wet dog. So, 95% of the candles that smell like wet dog are the ones that are more dangerous but do not explode. 

Since 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, 95% of 2500 candles are the ones that are more dangerous but do not smell like wet dog. This is 0.95 * 2500 = 2375 candles.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog. This is 5% of the total number of candles that are more dangerous, which is 0.05 * 2375 = 118.75. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a candle, we round down to 118 candles.

However, the problem states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles are more dangerous and can explode. So, 1% of 50,000 candles are the ones that are more dangerous and can explode. This is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. This is the intersection of the two conditions. We know that 118 candles are more dangerous and smell like wet dog, and 500 candles are more dangerous and can explode. However, the problem does not state that all candles that are more dangerous and can explode smell like wet dog. In fact, it states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. So, the number of candles that are more dangerous and can explode but do not smell like wet dog is 95% of 500, which is 0.95 * 500 = 475 candles.

Now, we can find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode by subtracting the number of candles that are more dangerous and can explode but do not smell like wet dog from the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog. This is 118 - 475 = -357. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of candles. This means that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 0.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation: (45 + x) + 105 = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get 150 + x = 500.

Subtracting 150 from both sides, we get x = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into the first equation:

D = 180 - C
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the trip and add them up.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 * 4 = 800 kilometers

In the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is:
(30/100) * 800 = 240 kilometers
So, the total distance traveled in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker.
   So, Zack's locker = 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches.
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker.
   So, Timothy's locker = 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches.

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance fallen: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. 

The first bank gave him $4000. 

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, let's add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is 18.

Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods.

For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month. 
6 months * $8 per month = $48

For the next 8 months, the cost is $12 per month.
8 months * $12 per month = $96

After that, the price increased to $14 per month. Since 2 years is 24 months, we need to find out how many months are left after the first 14 months (6 + 8). 
24 months - 14 months = 10 months

The cost for the remaining 10 months at $14 per month is:
10 months * $14 per month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for all the periods:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x.

Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation: x = 28 - 6
x = 22

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of this from the jogger jeans. 
1/3 of the total savings is (1/3) * 6 = 2.
So, the savings from the jogger jeans is $2.

The savings from the tattered jeans is the total savings minus the savings from the jogger jeans: 6 - 2 = 4.

The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4. 
So, the amount Cole paid for the tattered jeans is 28 - 4 = 24.

The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is 22 - 24 = -2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
- The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each day.
- The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each day.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and 3 homemade bird feeders, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type:

- Store-bought bird feeders: 3 * 20 = 60 birds
- Homemade bird feeders: 3 * 30 = 90 birds

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade bird feeders:

60 + 90 = 150

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he must have sold cards worth $50 to get the remaining amount. 

Since each card is sold for $1.5, the number of cards he sold is $50 / $1.5 = 33.33. However, since you can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards.

Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he kept is 1/3 * total_cards. Let's represent the total number of cards as 'x'. Then, the number of cards he kept is 1/3 * x.

The number of cards he sold is the total number of cards minus the number of cards he kept: x - 1/3 * x = 2/3 * x.

We know that the number of cards he sold is 33, so we can set up the equation: 2/3 * x = 33.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2: x = 33 * 3/2 = 49.5.

Since you can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we'll round down to 49 because we know he sold 33 cards and he kept 1/3 of his cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. 

These 18 guests would have two hotdogs each, so the total number of hotdogs prepared for them would be 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests to have one hotdog each, which is a total of 36 hotdogs.

Since 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed would be 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

However, the caterer only prepared 36 + 36 = 72 hotdogs. This means that there are 80 - 72 = 8 hotdogs missing.

Since each hotdog is for one guest, the 8 missing hotdogs would be for 8 guests. However, the question asks for the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog. 

Since 40 guests showed up and 8 hotdogs were missing, it means that 40 - 8 = 32 guests got a second hotdog. 

The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog would be the total number of guests minus the number of guests who got a second hotdog, which is 36 - 32 = 4.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
4. The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.
5. To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.
6. The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons of gas.

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 0.75 gallons is equal to 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the total amount of money George had initially is x dollars. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending, he spent 99% of his money. 

We know that 99% of x is equal to $5. We can write this as an equation: 0.99x = 5.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.99: x = 5 / 0.99 = 5.05.

Now, we know that George spent $5.05 in total. He spent 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, which is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20. 

The remaining amount he spent on candy bars is $5.05 - $1.20 = $3.85. 

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is $3.85 / 0.75 = 5.13. 

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.10 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. So, the number of candy bars he bought is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 / 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the remaining cake weight, we first need to find out how much cake was eaten. 

Rory and her mom each had a piece, so 2 pieces were eaten. Since the cake was cut into 8 pieces, the fraction of the cake eaten is 2/8. 

To find the weight of the cake eaten, we multiply the total weight of the cake by the fraction eaten: 
20 ounces * (2/8) = 20 * 2 / 8 = 40 / 8 = 5 ounces.

Now, we subtract the weight of the cake eaten from the total weight of the cake to find the remaining weight:
20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people

"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we first need to determine how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since it takes four times as long for Bernadette to get to the theater as it does for Wayne, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: width = area / length. 

Substituting the values we know, we get width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width). 

Substituting the values we know, we get perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in the number of beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after Marcus bakes and then after he opens the window.

Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to baking is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature becomes 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, it cools down for 3 intervals of 10 minutes each. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window being open is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to find out how long it took him to complete the entire triathlon. 

First, let's convert Jon's times into minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% less than Jon's, so it's 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it's 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
Time for James to run: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay will be 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the dozen cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 

50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out.

10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey has after his turn, we need to add the points he scored to his initial points.

Joey's total points: 240
Marcy's total points: 235
Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost of the sneakers is $576.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, so the revenue from Monday's sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31. These were sold for $25 each throughout the rest of the week, so the revenue from the rest of the week is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20 and get a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, the total cost is $21. 

If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price, the total cost is $12 + (popcorn price + soda price). 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket and the snacks is $21 - $2 = $19.

We know the soda costs $3, so the popcorn price can be represented as (popcorn price + $3) = $19 - $12 = $7.

To find the popcorn price, we subtract $3 from both sides of the equation: popcorn price = $7 - $3 = $4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4. 

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, so we can set up the equation: 20x = 900. 

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45. 

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65. 

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost is 170 * 65 = 10750.

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and add them together.

The total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds.

The total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds.

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

"Let's break down the problem. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as (x/2) + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation (x/2) + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 / $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the 2 trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is 24 * 2 = 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 can fit on the trays, so the number of eggs that won't fit is 64 - 48 = 16.

"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks 5 * 8 = 40 minutes every day.

After 5 days, she will have walked 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 now, three times that is 3 * 14 = 42.

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

To find Angela's current age, we need to subtract 4 from 42, because we know her age in four years. 

Angela's current age = 42 - 4 = 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

The total cost is $84 + $28 = $112.

"Let's break down the information given:

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so to find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by 3:

120 / 3 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the costs for each venue. 

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is (B/2) + 7.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. 

We can write the equation as: B + (B/2) + ((B/2) + 7) = 43

Combine like terms: B + B + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found: (B/2) + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by Mariah = 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by Mariah's grandma = 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 * 5 = 10.

3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 * 2 = 6.

The total number of gifts for all friends is 10 + 6 = 16.

Adding the 10 random gifts, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 16 + 10 = 26.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. 

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 
So, the rug's width = chair's width + 5 feet = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 
Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 = 16 feet.
The couch is 2 feet longer than this, so the couch's length = 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost of all the gum is $7.

We know that the total cost of the 3 non-strawberry packs is $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) = $3. 

Since the total cost of all the gum is $7, the cost of the 2 strawberry packs is $7 - $3 = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry packs by 2: $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar and then calculate how many of that type of wood he can buy with his budget.

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar.
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we will calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his budget.

Frederick has $24, so he can buy 24 / 6 = 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

Each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has 4 legs and he has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week, we need to calculate the cost of two bus trips per day for five days. 

Cost of two bus trips per day = 2 * $2.20 = $4.40
Cost of two bus trips per day for five days = $4.40 * 5 = $22.00

Now, we need to find out how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Amount saved = Cost of two bus trips per day for five days - Cost of weekly bus pass
Amount saved = $22.00 - $20.00
Amount saved = $2.00

"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120

"Let's break down the information given. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can represent the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as x. 

So, the number of onions Sophia bought is x, and the number of potatoes Sophia bought is also x. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation: 4x = 12 (onions) + 4 (potatoes). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 16. 

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4. 

x = 4.

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4 + 4 = 8.

"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 calories / 171 days = approximately 613 calories per day."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he earns a total of $30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned: $210 - $100 = $110.

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she needs to run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, the total distance is 0.25 km * 8 laps = 2 km.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.2 * $500 = $100

Now, Julie has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. 
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, Julie has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:
Cost of the house = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

"To find the profit, we first need to find the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there might be an error in the given information. If the profit is negative, it means Tara actually lost money. 

But if we assume that the question is asking for the amount of money she lost, then the answer would be $96."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 
   Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20) 
   Total money = $40 + $120 
   Total money = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money. 
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 
   Half of the total money = $80

3. Now, Ali has the remaining money after giving his sister half of it. 
   Remaining money = Total money - Half of the total money 
   Remaining money = $160 - $80 
   Remaining money = $80

4. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. 
   Money used for dinner = (3/5) * Remaining money 
   Money used for dinner = (3/5) * $80 
   Money used for dinner = $48

5. Now, we need to find the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

The total number of problems is 100. So, the number of problems left after Monday and Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first find out how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will have 1/3 of the raisins for the oatmeal cookies. 

1/3 of 27 cups of raisins is 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the available raisins by the amount needed for each batch.

9 cups of raisins / 3/4 cup per batch = 9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12 batches.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh. 

After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024. 

The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many days it would take for one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then we need to find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people can work together, it would take them half the time it would take one person. 

So, if one person takes 10 days, 5 people would take 10 / 2 = 5 days to paint a whole house.

Now, we need to convert the number of days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 5 days would be 5 * 24 = 120 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 42 + 130 = 172.

"Let's break down the information given. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for an unknown price. The total cost was $48. 

Let's denote the price of the headphone set as 'x'. We can set up the equation as follows:

4 + x = 48

To find the price of the headphone set, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the price of the headphone set is $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. If he had spent the $44 on CDs instead, he could have bought:

44 / 4 = 11 CDs

Since he could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphone set, and he could have bought 1 CD with the money he spent on the CD itself, the total number of CDs he could have bought is:

11 + 1 = 12

However, the question asks how many more CDs he could have bought, not the total number of CDs he could have bought. Since he could have bought 12 CDs in total, and he actually bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

12 - 1 = 11

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. 
Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times 21 is 63, but since it's 3 times fewer, we subtract 63 from 21 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21 - 63 = -42. However, since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 is 3 times more than the number of passengers who got in. So, the number of passengers who got in is 21 / 3 = 7.

Now, the total number of passengers is:
59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.
4. The difference in their current ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer = $2,400
2. Cost of the computer = $1,100
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from this total to find the cost of the 2 monitors:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of the computer + Cost of the printer)
= $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since we want to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to find out the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) seashells.

First, we calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 600 = 2400.

Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this: 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought: 3000 / 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, let's assume George had 'x' candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies.

Now, George ate 5 candies, so he has 3 candies left. This means that before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since George had 'x' candies initially, we can set up the equation: x = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had. Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had 2x = 2(8) = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Total vlogs Emma aims to make = 72

Vlogs needed to be made = Total vlogs aimed - Total vlogs made so far
= 72 - 54
= 18

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how much you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount. 

Half of $60 is $60 / 2 = $30.

So, you ended up paying $30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

2. The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so his new total is:

New total after adding $5 = $6 + $5 = $11

3. The following day, he added another $10 to his total, so his new total is:

New total after adding $10 = $11 + $10 = $21

4. He then spent $8 from his total, so his new total is:

New total after spending $8 = $21 - $8 = $13

5. He saved some more money and tripled the amount he had left after spending $8. To find the new total, we multiply the amount he had left by 3:

New total after tripling = $13 * 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy has $39 now."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount he saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount Elvis wants to save in April is $1125. So, the sum of the amounts he saves in the first and second half should be equal to $1125.

We can write the equation as: xy + 2y(30 - x) = 1125

Simplifying the equation, we get: xy + 60y - 2xy = 1125
Combine like terms: -xy + 60y = 1125
Factor out y: y(-x + 60) = 1125
Divide both sides by (-x + 60): y = 1125 / (-x + 60)

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we need to find the value of 2y. We can substitute the value of y from the above equation into 2y.

2y = 2 * (1125 / (-x + 60))

However, we don't know the value of x. We know that the total number of days in April is 30, and the first half and second half have the same number of days. So, x = 30 / 2 = 15.

Now, substitute the value of x into the equation for 2y:
2y = 2 * (1125 / (15 + 60))
2y = 2 * (1125 / 75)
2y = 2 * 15
2y = 30

Now, we need to find the value of y. We can divide both sides by 2:
y = 30 / 2
y = 15

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of 2y, which is the amount Elvis needs to save in the second half:
2y = 30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get for 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Jairus and Jenny get. 

$16 - $10 = $6.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars. So, the sum of what Jeff and Brad get should be equal to 100.

We can write this as an equation: x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x: x = 20

Since x is the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the miles he walks each day by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. 

James's play set has 80 toys. A play set five times larger than James's would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: 

Let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, x + 2 = 400.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: 

x + 2 - 2 = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

Commission for the sales over $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
Additional commission for the sales over $1000: 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * 1500 = $150

Total commission: $300 + $150 = $450

So, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill already has, we need to multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles in each case. 

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Since Bill wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest.

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many more bottles Bill needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs.

140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a hot day, we need to first calculate it. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. 

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a hot day. 

To find out how long Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we multiply the time it takes to swim a mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

To find out how long Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day, we multiply the time it takes to swim a mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

The difference in time between the two is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. If we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 'x', then Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake.

Current intake of Juan = 5x
Recommended intake of Juan = 4

Reduction in coffee intake = 5x - 4

Since we don't know the value of 'x', we can express the reduction in terms of 'x'. However, we can find the reduction in terms of a percentage or a relation to the recommended intake. 

To find the reduction in terms of the recommended intake, we can express it as a fraction of the recommended intake: (5x - 4) / 4.

However, since the question asks for a numerical answer, we need to assume a value for 'x'. Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 8 (this is a common recommendation). 

x = 8
Current intake of Juan = 5x = 5 * 8 = 40 cups
Recommended intake of Juan = 4 cups
Reduction in coffee intake = 40 - 4 = 36 cups

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Now that we know there are 70 intervals of 1.5 minutes, and she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we multiply 70 by 2 to find the total pages she read in the first week. 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. He spent a total of 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20. 

Since Peter has $70 and spent $20 on wooden action figures, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left. 

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $50 left and will spend 4 days, so the total amount spent on plastic action figures is 4 * $2 = $8.

"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will withdraw in 2 years and subtract it from her initial savings.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she will withdraw from her initial savings:

$3000 (initial savings) - $2400 (total withdrawn) = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

The total cost for 1 sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

The revenue from selling 1 sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit for 1 sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70.

The net profit for 10 sandwiches is $3.70 * 10 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to first find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find out the total number of small pieces of crayons. 

There are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so the total number of crayons is 3 * 64 = 192. 

Since each box has 64 crayons, and each crayon is divided into 8 small pieces, the total number of small pieces is 192 * 8 = 1536.

Now, we need to find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make. Since she melts 8 small pieces together in each muffin tin, the number of muffin crayons is 1536 / 8 = 192.

Since each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, the total amount of money Kate can make is 192 * $1.50 = $288.

The final answer is: $288"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

Total birds seen on days 1 and 2: 50
Total birds seen on days 4 and 5: 120
Total birds seen on day 6: 20
Total birds seen on day 7: 90

Total birds seen over the week = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 350

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds seen per day = Total birds seen over the week / Number of days

"To find the final value of the number train, let's break down the operations step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we first need to find out how many cards the brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 fewer cards than he has. So, the brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

To do this, we can multiply 520 by 0.04 (which is 4% expressed as a decimal) and subtract the result from 520.

0.04 * 520 = 20.8

Now, subtract 20.8 from 520:

520 - 20.8 = 499.2

So, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees for the recipe that calls for 520 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we need to add the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils (12 cups + 24 dishes).
Her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils (40 cups + 44 dishes).

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of contacts, we multiply the number of contacts in one box by the number of boxes Pete buys: 90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts.

Since the contacts will last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts/day.

To find the total number of days the contacts will last, we multiply the number of contacts by the number of contacts used per day: 180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days.

Since the contacts will last 90 days, Pete only needs to buy 1 box of contacts, not 2. 

The original price of one box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00.

To find the discounted price, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete only needs 1 box of contacts, the cost per pair of contacts is the same as the cost of one box, which is $90.00.

The final answer is: $90.00"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during the activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during aerobics = 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during running = 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories burned during aerobics + calories burned during running = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to find out how many sets of 200 calories are there in 1600 calories.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 sets of 100 ml of water. 

8 * 100 = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM. 
If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To find the average, we add the three measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the difference in weight change between the two options.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week.

The difference in weight change per week is 1.75 - 1.25 = 0.5 pounds/week.

To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we multiply the difference in weight change per week by the number of weeks: 
0.5 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given:

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex then calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people Alex's friends are bringing is 10 + 8 = 18.

3. To find the total number of people attending, we add the people invited via email and the people Alex's friends are bringing: 300 + 18 = 318.

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 318 + 1 = 319.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Amazon cost = $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so the shipping cost is $4 * 2 = $8.

eBay cost = $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon.

Difference = eBay cost - Amazon cost = $21 - $20 = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find out how many grams of protein are in 200 grams of mushrooms. 

First, we need to find out how many cups of mushrooms John eats per day. Since 1 cup weighs 100 grams, we can divide 200 grams by 100 grams to get the number of cups. 

200 grams / 100 grams = 2 cups

Now that we know John eats 2 cups of mushrooms per day, we can find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since 1 cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply 2 cups by 3 grams to get the total grams of protein per day. 

2 cups * 3 grams/cup = 6 grams

Now that we know John gets 6 grams of protein per day, we can find out how many grams of protein he gets per week. 

There are 7 days in a week, so we can multiply 6 grams by 7 to get the total grams of protein per week. 

6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write the equation: 
x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:
-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:
x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
Jerry's age in 3 years = 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find out how much he still needs to pay, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
And one angle is three times the smallest angle, so it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of all three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation as:
x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:
6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:
x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 24 = 34 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 48 = 58 games at the end of the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve has at the end of the third year: 22 (from the first year) + 34 (from the second year) + 58 (from the third year) = 114 games.

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 
3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa make 60 and 45 pounds of chocolates per hour respectively. 

In 12 hours, Ruiz will make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
In 12 hours, Marissa will make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tire can last. 

Total rotations = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Months the tire can last = Total rotations / Rotations per month = 10,440,000 / 290,000 = 36 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tire can last by dividing the number of months by 12.

Years the tire can last = 36 months / 12 months/year = 3 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. 

Since there are 60 washings per pump, and the total cost is $24.00, we need to find the cost per pump. 

First, we convert the total cost to cents: $24.00 * 100 = 2400 cents.

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 2 pumps = 1200 cents per 2 pumps.

To find the cost per pump, we divide the cost per 2 pumps by 2: 1200 cents / 2 = 600 cents per pump.

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has. $50 - $42 = $8.

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants he wants to make is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we need to multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street.

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Monica's street: 150 meters

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street to find the difference.

Difference: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. 
50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so the increased funding is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

The total cost of John's research is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour periods are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per period = 4 periods

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per period, he chews 4 pieces at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

He started with 20 pieces, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7.

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 * 3 = 30

For the remaining days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days, which means it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. There are 4 remaining days in the week (since 7 - 3 = 4). So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining days is:
6 * 4 = 24

Now, we add the total number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days:
30 + 24 = 54

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them:
Profit = Selling price - Cost to acquire
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profit:
Commission = Profit * 0.1
Commission = $175,000 * 0.1
Commission = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 to get the total number of riders who can stay upright: 
100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6 to get the number of women who can stay upright:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright:

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

"To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to determine the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed can't be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph | = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

The distance Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob is the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends is $60. We can set up an equation to represent this:

10 - x * 10 = 60

Simplifying the equation:

10 - 10x = 60

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-10x = 50

Divide both sides by -10:

x = -5

However, since we can't have a negative number of classes, this means that Manny can't miss any classes and still have his parents sign him up again."
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine how many customers each of them can process in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day. Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in the first month 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats in the first month is $400, which is half of 'x', so we can write the equation as:

400 = x/2

To find the value of 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is $800.

Now, the total sales in the first month is the sum of sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800 = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month is:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Sales in the second month = 900

The total sales in two months is the sum of sales in the first and second months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900 = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find out how much James paid, we need to calculate the total number of paid hours and the cost for each hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only paid for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the cost for the second hour is $30, and the cost for the third hour is $30.

The total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received. 

First, let's find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. 

Her initial balance was $200, and her expected wage is $300. So, her expected balance should be $200 + $300 = $500.

However, her actual balance is $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract her actual balance from her expected balance: $500 - $420 = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves make up a dozen eggs. 

1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs
1 dozen eggs = 2 * 6 deviled egg halves (since 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves)
1 dozen eggs = 12 deviled egg halves

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs to make 48 deviled egg halves. 

48 deviled egg halves / 12 deviled egg halves per dozen = 4 dozens

So, Lori will need 4 dozens of eggs."

"To find the total cost for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $230,000.

The final answer is: $230,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the equation for the total number of legs: 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now, substitute G in the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combine like terms: 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2S = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 15.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we can calculate this as 60% of 150.

60% of 150 = 0.6 * 150 = 90 history teachers.

Now, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60 math teachers.

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we can find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day by multiplying the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

Total time spent sleeping = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day

2. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. 
   So, Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = $90.
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. 
   So, Rayna has 90 + 60 = $150.

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together: 
Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has $90, and Rayna has $150. 
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = $360.

If they decide to add their money together and share it equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3 (the number of people).
Total money / 3 = 360 / 3 = $120.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be represented as: 
Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation: 
21 = 2 * Sally's books + 3

To find Sally's books, we need to isolate Sally's books on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 
21 - 3 = 2 * Sally's books
18 = 2 * Sally's books

Next, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find Sally's books: 
18 / 2 = Sally's books
9 = Sally's books

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. 

When James comes back, there are 8 more dogs, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 12 toys.

However, James finds out that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. So, the total number of dogs now is 12 + 16 = 28.

James needs 28 toys for these dogs. However, when he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. 

The total number of toys James needs is 28 - 3 = 25.

Let the original length of the dress be x cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t. We are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can write the equation: 2T + t = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation: T = t + 7.

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for t: 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combine like terms: 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 3t = 30.

Divide both sides by 3: t = 10.

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's represent the total bill as 'x'. Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can set up the equation: 0.6x = $40 + $20 (vaccine cost). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.6x = $60. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.6: x = $60 / 0.6 = $100. 

So, the total bill is $100. 

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought: $125 - $100 = $25.

So, Martha collected 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom. 
50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
So, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

The final answer is: 145"
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to start with the number of great grand-babies each grandchild has, which is 3, and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren Great Grandma Jones has, which is 3.

So, 3 great grand-babies per grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 9 great grand-babies.

However, this is not the final answer yet. Each of Great Grandma Jones' children also has 3 children of their own, and each of these children also has 3 great grand-babies. So, we need to multiply the number of great grand-babies by the number of children each of Great Grandma Jones' children has, which is 3.

So, 9 great grand-babies * 3 children per child = 27 great grand-babies.

But we're not done yet. Each of Great Grandma Jones' children also has 3 children of their own, and each of these children also has 3 great grand-babies. So, we need to multiply the number of great grand-babies by the number of children each of Great Grandma Jones' children has, which is 3.

So, 27 great grand-babies * 3 children per child = 81 great grand-babies.

However, this is still not the final answer. We need to multiply this by 3, because each of Great Grandma Jones' children also has 3 children of their own, and each of these children also has 3 great grand-babies.

So, 81 great grand-babies * 3 children per child = 243 great grand-babies.

The final answer is: 243"
"To find out how much Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment, then subtract those amounts from her paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract the amounts from her paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend."
"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to find the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box.

Total capacity of the box = 20 pencils
Pencils missing = 4
Pencils in the box = Total capacity of the box - Pencils missing
Pencils in the box = 20 - 4
Pencils in the box = 16

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils in the box. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs = Pencils in the box / 2
Number of pairs = 16 / 2
Number of pairs = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find out how many fireworks will be set off in total and then calculate 40% of that number.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off by the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, so the total number of fireworks she will set off is 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of fireworks set off is 300 (by the city) + 15 (by Hannah) = 315.

Now, we need to find 40% of 315. To do this, we multiply 315 by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%).

0.4 * 315 = 126

So, Hannah will see 126 fireworks in total."
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person saves a seat, so they buy drinks and snacks for 20 people. Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 20 * 2 (drinks) + 20 * 3 (snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 items * $2 = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds
Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
= 11,600 - 8,800
= 2,800 pounds

The final answer is: 2800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that there are 8 males and 6 females, so the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by all people is 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by all people, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying 100 by 3/5. 

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Now, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the book from his initial amount to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. This means that if the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second, the turtle's speed is 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second.

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the turtle's speed (3 feet/second) by the time (40 seconds).

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise in total, we need to first find out how much they need to raise per hour. 

The amount raised after the first 3 hours is $2100. To find the amount raised per hour, we divide the amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage used for industrial purposes and subtract it from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 8%.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first find the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks will have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, we multiply the total number of days by her daily charge: 
14 days * $12/day = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. So, the production rate of chocolate ice cream is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. So, the production rate of vanilla ice cream is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

Cost of croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
Cost of mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Total cost before discount: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Discount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Total bill after discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to first calculate the total number of scoops she can get with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 free. So, for every 3 scoops, Erin pays for 2 scoops. 

To find out how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can buy, we can divide the total number of scoops she can buy by 3. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1 set with 1 scoop left over

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a scoop, she can buy 1 set of 3 scoops and 1 additional scoop. 

1 set of 3 scoops (2 paid scoops + 1 free scoop) and 1 additional scoop = 4 scoops

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger's remaining candies after two weeks: 100 - 56 = 44

Amy's remaining candies after two weeks: 100 - 42 = 58

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candies from Amy's remaining candies: 58 - 44 = 14

First, let's find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends. Since each pizza has 12 slices, and they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by them as follows:

Total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 5 * 12 * (2/3) = 40

Now, let's find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. Since they ate ¾ of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by them as follows:

Total number of slices eaten by two remaining friends = 2 * 12 * (3/4) = 9

Now, let's find the total number of slices eaten by all friends. 

Total number of slices eaten by all friends = 40 + 9 = 49

Since there were 5 pizzas in total, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

Length of Topher's shoe = 9x + 10
100 = 9x + 10

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

90 = 9x

Next, we divide both sides by 9 to isolate 'x':

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars:
There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. 
Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars.
Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah:
Total windows smashed = 64 (from students' cars) + 48 (from teachers' cars) = 112

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water available.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the total amount of water available: 
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we know that a gallon jar costs $5 and a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. 

So, the cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Now, let's add the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:
Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music. 
Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball) 
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since we know that students who like to play music = 10, students who like to play video games = students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music
= 35 - 10
= 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many birds were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the number of students in each class is x. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x.

We are given that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class.

Now, we are given that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4):

Number of girls in each class = 40 * 0.4
= 16

Since the total number of students in each class is 40, the number of boys in each class can be found by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students:

Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
= 24

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24.

The final answer is: 24"

"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups required for the activity. 

Total students = 54
Groups required for the activity = 12

However, the question states that the activity requires 12 groups, but we are asked to find out how many more groups are needed to form, given that 54 students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. 

So, we first need to find out how many students are in each group for the activity. 

Students per group for the activity = Total students / Groups required for the activity
Students per group for the activity = 54 / 12
Students per group for the activity = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are given that the students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. 

Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we need to find out how many groups are needed for 54 students with 9 students per group.

Total groups = Total students / Students per group
Total groups = 54 / 9
Total groups = 6

Since the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

More groups needed = Groups required for the activity - Total groups
More groups needed = 12 - 6

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 20 large buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers

Since large buttons are worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons: 
20 large buttons = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

Now, let's add up all the small buttons: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from large buttons

Total small buttons = 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons

Total buttons = 147 small buttons + 20 large buttons = 167 buttons

3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as 'x'. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases, and x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we multiply 600 by 1/3:
600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can buy the series for $6, the cost of the series is $6.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 remaining movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are not in series and are not older movies, so they are normal movies. There are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

"To find the total amount Winston spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

"To find the distance, we first need to find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at 50 miles per hour. Half of that is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than that, so they hiked at 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

The time they spent hiking is 1.5 hours. To find the distance they hiked, we multiply the speed by the time: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The time they spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. To find the distance they drove, we multiply the speed by the time: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The total distance is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

The final answer is: 255"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on (x + 8) enemies. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects (x + 3) berries.

The time difference between Ava and Emma is 4 seconds, so Emma finishes the level 4 seconds earlier than Ava. 
Since Emma finishes the level 4 seconds earlier, Emma's timer score is 30 * (60 - (60 - 4)) = 30 * 4 = 120 points. 
Ava's timer score is 30 * (60 - (60 - 4)) - 4 = 30 * 4 - 4 = 116 points.

Now, let's calculate their scores:
Emma's score = x + 5 * (number of berries Emma collects) + 120
Emma's score = x + 5 * (number of berries Emma collects) + 120
Emma's score = x + 5 * (number of berries Emma collects) + 120

Ava's score = (x + 8) + 5 * (x + 3) + 116
Ava's score = x + 8 + 5x + 15 + 116
Ava's score = 6x + 139

The difference between their scores is Ava's score - Emma's score:
Difference = (6x + 139) - (x + 5 * (number of berries Emma collects) + 120)
Since we don't know the number of berries Emma collects, let's assume it is y. 
Difference = (6x + 139) - (x + 5y + 120)
Difference = 5x - 5y + 19

However, we know that Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so y = x - 3.
Difference = 5x - 5(x - 3) + 19
Difference = 5x - 5x + 15 + 19
Difference = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that we know. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all four pizzas - Cost of two known pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of one pizza.

Cost of one pizza = Cost of the other two pizzas / 2
Cost of one pizza = 4 / 2
Cost of one pizza = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week. 

15 (usual days) + 12 (extra days) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17. Since the fish in the pet store tank were a mix of white and orange, we can set up an equation based on the fact that the total number of fish he bought is 17. The equation would be: x + 2x = 17.

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 17.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 17 / 3.

x = 5.67 (approximately)

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the number of white fish he bought, and we can't have a fraction of a fish. However, we can still solve for x and then use it to find the number of white fish he bought.

x = 5.67 is not a whole number, but we can solve for x and then use it to find the number of white fish he bought."
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

The total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the amount of fuel consumed in a week. The fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the amount of fuel consumed in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of fuel per week. The price of gas is $3/gallon, so the total cost of fuel per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent from the quarters. Since she was given 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount she spent from the quarters is:

140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent from the twenties. She was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. So, the number of twenties she spent is:

10 * 3/5 = 6 twenties

Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount she spent from the twenties is:

6 twenties * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount she paid for lunch:

$35 + $120 = $155

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Half of the trip cost = $300 / 2 = $150

The school will cover $150, and John has $50. To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. 

It was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night. So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to at least 32 degrees. 

To find out how many degrees Carson needs to heat the house, we subtract the current temperature from the temperature at which the pipes won't freeze: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the number of degrees he needs to heat the house by the number of degrees each log heats the house: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find the total money used, we need to calculate the time each person plays and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 
Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute for Jack is 1/20 dollars per minute. 

The two friends who are worse than Jack can play for half as long, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 
The friend who is better than Jack can play for 1.5 times as long, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played by all friends is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

The cost per minute for all friends is the same as Jack's, which is 1/20 dollars per minute.

- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'x'. Since the amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of salt is 2x. Since the amount of sugar is equal to the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also 2x.

The total amount of the ingredients (excluding oil) is x + x + 2x + 2x = 6x.

Since the total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, the amount of oil can be calculated as follows:

6x + oil = 10
oil = 10 - 6x

Since the amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt, oil = 2 * 2x = 4x.

Now, we can equate the two expressions for oil:

10 - 6x = 4x
10 = 10x
x = 1

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil:
oil = 4x
oil = 4 * 1
oil = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already available = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Cupcakes needed to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already available
= 63 - 48
= 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. So, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. In total, he gave away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He had 40 cars initially and gave away 24 cars. So, Joe has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 
12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means 1/2 of 70 cars had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to calculate the total amount he earns from one cycle and then multiply it by the number of cycles he does in a day. 

Each cycle has 5 tasks and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns from one cycle is 5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, the total amount he earns in a day is 30 cycles * $6/cycle = $180.

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by 7. 

$180/day * 7 days = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we already know that she scored 14 points.

In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. So, we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them up.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping = (cost per pound * weight) + (cost per mile * distance)
- Total cost of shipping = (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
- Total cost of shipping = 1.4 + 1.6
- Total cost of shipping = 3

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
- Purchase price: $32
- Refund amount = 0.75 * purchase price
- Refund amount = 0.75 * 32
- Refund amount = 24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total amount lost = total cost of shipping - refund amount
- Total amount lost = 3 - 24
- Total amount lost = -21

However, since the total amount lost is negative, it means that Milly will actually gain $21."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she has after her father gave her $100. 

Initial amount of money Mulan has: $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought:

Two pairs of jeans at $30 each: 2 * $30 = $60
Cost of the bag: $20
Total cost of items: $60 + $20 = $80

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount of money Mulan has:

Total amount of money Mulan has now: $140
Total cost of items: $80
Amount of money Mulan has left: $140 - $80 = $60

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Total monthly production is 50,000 bars. To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

- Time spent on writing songs: 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
- Time spent on makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
- Time spent on recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes = 72 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 120 + 90 + 72 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok in a month = 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Total cost: $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay, Kagiyami, and Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours to travel across the highway.

Since there are four turtles, we need to divide the time it takes for one turtle by 4 to find the time it takes for four turtles. 

Time for four turtles = 108 / 4 = 27 hours.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help. 

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
Original price of the laptop: $600
Discount for trading in her old laptop: $200
Price after trading in: $600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. 
Total money received: $150 + $80 = $230

Now, let's add the money she received to the price of the laptop after trading in:

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. 

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5 to find out how many cows are needed. 

25 / 5 = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from 5 to find out how many more cows he needs.

5 - 3 = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the used length of each glue stick and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 of the original length. 
5/6 of 12 millimeters is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used length is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the original length. 
1/3 of 12 millimeters is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 of the original length. 
1/2 of 12 millimeters is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the used lengths of all three glue sticks: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 - 20 = -8 millimeters. However, since we cannot have a negative length, this means that the total used length is more than the original length, which is not possible. This indicates that the problem has an error in the given information."

However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on the first day, the second day, and the third day, and then add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Now, let's add the amount of water on each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To find the total number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day and add them up.

Day 1: Initially, there are 10 people infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of people infected on Day 1 is 10 + (10 * 6) = 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 2: The 70 people infected on Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of people infected on Day 2 is 70 + (70 * 6) = 70 + 420 = 490.

Day 3: The 490 people infected on Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of people infected on Day 3 is 490 + (490 * 6) = 490 + 2940 = 3430.

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the amount Rafaela received and subtract it from Rafaela's total. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount they received altogether is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

Jennifer gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 * 2 = 6 oranges. 
She also gave her son 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges. 
So, the number of oranges she remained with is 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl would be:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If Gretchen has 70 gold coins, then the number of silver coins can be found by subtracting 30 from 70. 

Number of silver coins = 70 - 30 = 40

Now, to find the total number of coins, we need to add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total number of coins = 70 + 40
Total number of coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos ordered was 600. 

To find the total number of leftover burritos, we subtract the number of burritos given to the students and the number eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered. 

So, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - (500 + 20) = 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars. 

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expression for A from the second equation into the first equation:
S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)
Substituting the expressions for S and A, we get:
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85
Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84
Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, the weight of the sweet potatoes is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots Daisy bought is 7 pounds."
"To find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs, we first need to find out how many jello cups he needs in total. Since there are 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

The cost of one box of jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone: 
5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can divide the amount Keenan spends in a month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate in total, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

Now, let's calculate 7/13 of the remaining pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the number of pieces he ate each day.
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda, we need to divide the total cost of 7 bottles of soda by 7 and then multiply it by 3. 

Cost of 1 bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

To find the cost of 2 bottles of water, we need to divide the total cost of 4 bottles of water by 4 and then multiply it by 2.

Cost of 1 bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water to find the total cost.

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to first find out her rate of earning per hour. 

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. 

Rate per hour = Total earnings / Total hours
Rate per hour = $33 / 3 hours
Rate per hour = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply her rate per hour by the total hours she will work to find her total earnings.

Total earnings = Rate per hour * Total hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each question is worth 1 point, so she gets 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each question is worth 1 point, so she gets 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Each question is worth 5 points, so she gets 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score:

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling these chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000. This means that the total amount he spent on buying the chickens is:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Now, we know that Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah and Mitchell sold 16 glasses each. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie.

Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to first calculate how much money she will make from selling the rope. 

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount she will get from selling the rope is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, she plans to use this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost per meter of the new rope: $40 / $1.5 = 26.67 meters.

Since she can't buy a fraction of a meter, we'll round down to 26 meters. 

Now, we need to find out how much she will spend on the new rope: 26 * $1.5 = $39.

Finally, to find out how much money she will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she got from selling the old rope: $40 - $39 = $1.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's assume the number of years is 'x'. 

In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age + 'x' years, which is 8 + x. 

We are given that her age in 'x' years will be thrice her present age, so we can write the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8 + x = 24.

Now, let's solve for 'x': x = 24 - 8 = 16.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart:
$10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156

However, this is the total cost of the items, not the amount spent. Since Kelly has not purchased these items yet, we need to subtract this amount from her budget to find out how much money she has left. But, we need to subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left.

Kelly's budget is $65, so we need to subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
$65 - $156 = -$91

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to purchase the items in her cart.

But, if we are looking for the amount of money she has left in her budget, we need to find the difference between her budget and the total cost of the items. Since she does not have enough money, we can say that she has -$91 left in her budget."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the runtime of Elaina's usual concert be x minutes. 

The final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, so its runtime is 2x minutes. 

At the end of the concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. 

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore. 

So, we can write the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 'x'. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals each orchid has: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals each daisy has: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. 
Number of indoor plants = 100 * (1/4) = 25

Remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.
Number of outdoor plants = 75 * (2/3) = 50

Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25/100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the information given. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. 

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2: $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. She made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn.
3. The number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is three times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.
4. The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is five times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.

Let's assume the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn is 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6x + $6(3x) + $6(5x) = $6(9x) = $54x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. So, $54x + (amount from lemonade) = $80.

The amount from lemonade is $80 - $54x.

Since we don't know the value of x, we need to find a way to determine it. However, we can use the fact that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. This means that x must be a whole number, as she can't mow a fraction of a lawn.

Let's try x = 1. If x = 1, then she mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. In this case, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 + $18 + $30 = $54.

Since the total amount she made is $80, the amount from lemonade is $80 - $54 = $26.

Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $26.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. Let's call the number of notebooks Martha initially had 'x'. 

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so now she has x + 5 notebooks.

We are also given that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can set up the equation x + 5 = 7 to find the initial number of notebooks Martha had.

Solving for x, we get x = 2.

Now that we know Martha initially had 2 notebooks, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had: 3x = 3 * 2 = 6.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

To do this, we divide 96 by 6: 96 ÷ 6 = 16.

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after dinner. 

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating dinner, that's a total of 3 adults and 2 children, which equals 5 people. 

Each adult can eat one bowl, so the adults will eat 3 bowls. Each child can also eat one bowl, so the children will eat 2 bowls. 

In total, 3 + 2 = 5 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since 5 bowls were eaten for dinner, we need to find out how many bowls the pot can fill in terms of child's bowls. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child's bowls, we can say that 1 adult bowl equals 2 child's bowls. 

So, 5 bowls (eaten for dinner) in terms of child's bowls is 5 * 2 = 10 child's bowls. 

Since there are 8 child's bowls in the pot, and 10 child's bowls were eaten for dinner, there are 8 - 10 = -2 child's bowls left. However, since we can't have a negative number of bowls, this means that there are 8 - 10 = -2 child's bowls left, which is actually 8 - 10 = -2, but since we can't have a negative number of bowls, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Adam's age four years ago be 'x'. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation as:
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, his age eight years ago would be 60 - 8 = 52.

Now, we can equate the two expressions:
2x = 52

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 2:
x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. 

To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes in an hour and then multiply that by the number of hours he works and his hourly wage.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * $0.20 = $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Total bologna thrown = 58
- Number of red balloons = 20

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the total bologna thrown at red balloons = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, let's find out how much bologna was thrown at yellow balloons. 
Total bologna thrown - bologna thrown at red balloons = bologna thrown at yellow balloons
58 - 40 = 18

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons = 18 / 3 = 6

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. To find the cost of 1 balloon, we divide $0.5 by 2, which is $0.25. Since there are 12 balloons in a dozen, the total cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.
4. The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.
5. Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of their combined allowance is $28.
6. Since they both received the same amount of allowance, we can let x be the amount each of them received. The total amount they received is 2x.
7. Since the total amount they received is equal to the total cost of the items, we can set up the equation 2x = $28.
8. To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us x = $28 / 2 = $14.

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

14 - 2 = 12

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice that number playing volleyball, there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing soccer is 16 boys + 22 girls = 38 students.

Now, let's add the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit, we need to first find the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day. 
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to count the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

From 5 to 10 years old is 5 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 years is 5 x 12 = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, she will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. So, the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since we can't have half a cup of tea, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5. 

However, if there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. This leaves 27 - 12 - 12 = 3 cups of tea for the cinnamon tea, which is not enough to make 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15. This leaves 27 - 15 - 15 = -3 cups of tea, which is not possible.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine how much water is initially filled in the tank. Since they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the tank will have 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, it will be emptied by 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining water. Remaining water = Initial water - Water used = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to first calculate how much money he has left. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we multiply the calories of each mini pastry by the number of each type of pastry Andrew baked. 

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. 

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from all the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 
We are also given that P = Pp + J. 
We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 4J = 80.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had a total of 1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table and subtract the number of tables they already have.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables needed in total
30 tables needed - 15 tables already owned = 15 tables needed

So, they need 15 new tables. 

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay. 

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the remaining 5 hours, he will pay 70 pesos per hour. 

Cost for the first 12 hours: 1000 pesos
Cost for the additional 5 hours: 5 * 70 = 350 pesos
Total cost: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron had chosen the 24-hour option. 
Cost for 24 hours: 1600 pesos

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the 17-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 
Savings: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much John earned, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked. 

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent on gas and the cost of the pencils from his earnings.

300 dollars - 50 dollars - (5 * 10 dollars) = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money.

200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

Now, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money.

100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 + 350 = 650."

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles she gives to the students. 

There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got. 

900 - 58 = 842

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

Labor cost = $35 per hour * 2.25 hours = $78.75
Cost of parts = $60
Visit fee = $40

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of 5 * $40 = $200 from selling them.

However, he spent $90 on the CDs and made $200 from selling 5 of them. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent on the CDs he kept. 

Amount of CDs he kept = 10 - 5 = 5
Price of 5 CDs after discount = 5 * $15 * 0.6 = $45
Amount he was out = $90 - $45 = $45

The final answer is: $45"

"To find the total time taken by James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims before resting.
Distance swum = 20 miles * 60% = 20 * 0.6 = 12 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time taken to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
Time taken to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Time rested = Time taken to swim 12 miles / 2 = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance to be swum.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Step 5: Calculate the new speed after James reduces his speed by half.
New speed = Original speed / 2 = 2 mph / 2 = 1 mph

Step 6: Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance at the new speed.
Time taken to swim 8 miles = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours

Step 7: Calculate the total time taken by James to cross the lake.
Total time = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time rested + Time taken to swim 8 miles
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from it.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to subtract the stickers she lost from the stickers she initially received, and then add the stickers she got for helping her classmates.

Jasmine initially received 15 stickers.
She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8
Then, she got 5 more stickers for helping her classmates, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice the age of Marcus.
4. Since Marcus is 21, Leo's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Bahati scored the most points.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.
4. The total points scored by the team is 45.

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Dinar as D, and Bahati as B.

From point 2, we can write an equation: B = A + 20.
From point 3, we can write another equation: B = D + 10.
Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can equate the two expressions for B: A + 20 = D + 10.
Simplifying the equation, we get A = D + 10.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so we can write the equation: A + D + B = 45.
Substituting B = A + 20 and B = D + 10 into the equation, we get A + D + (A + 20) + (D + 10) = 45.
Combine like terms: 2A + 2D + 30 = 45.
Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A + 2D = 15.
Divide both sides by 2: A + D = 7.5.

Now we have A = D + 10 and A + D = 7.5. We can substitute A = D + 10 into A + D = 7.5: (D + 10) + D = 7.5.
Combine like terms: 2D + 10 = 7.5.
Subtract 10 from both sides: 2D = -2.5.
Divide both sides by 2: D = -1.25.

Now that we have D, we can find A: A = D + 10 = -1.25 + 10 = 8.75.

Now that we have A, we can find B: B = A + 20 = 8.75 + 20 = 28.75.

However, since the question asks for the number of points Azibo scored, we need to find A, which is 8.75."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports per minute

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes he worked by the number of reports he staples per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we need to calculate the time she slept from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. and from 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.

From 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours and 15 minutes, which is 4 * 60 + 15 = 255 minutes.

From 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 17 minutes, which is 3 * 60 + 17 = 217 minutes.

The total time she slept is 255 + 217 = 472 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking (23 minutes) and the time she woke up earlier (5 minutes) from the total sleep time: 472 - 23 - 5 = 444 minutes.

"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100

So, the hospital has 100 occupied beds initially. 

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, in 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted will be:
50 * 14 = 700

Now, the total number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the new admissions:
100 + 700 = 800

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000, so the number of unoccupied beds will be:
1000 - 800 = 200

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

20% of 100 is 20.

Now, subtract 20 from 100 to find the actual percentage of people who attended the concert.
100 - 20 = 80%

Now, we need to find 80% of the number reported by Courtney to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them, which is 1 (carried by Jeffrey) + 2 (carried by Jason) + 4 (carried by Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we first need to determine the total number of holes at the end of the first day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day.

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, and on the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

We know that at the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11."
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 
50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into this one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the northerly direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying south for the last part of the journey, we need to add the distance traveled in the southerly direction to the distance traveled in the northerly direction to find the total distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Total southerly distance = 300 - 36 = 264 miles

However, the bird also flew south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so we need to add this distance to the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 264 + (22 * 5) = 264 + 110 = 374 miles

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the total southerly distance:
Distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years).

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left. 

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The USA has 50 states.

Let's assume the number of states in India is 'x'. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we can write the equation as:

x = (50 / 2) + 4
x = 25 + 4
x = 29

Now, we know the number of states in India is 29. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 
Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 
Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage. 
Hours to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5

The final answer is: $540"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. 

Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total hours she will be outside is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount on the red car = 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount on the red car
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60 and the price of the blue car is $100.

The total cost of both cars is $60 + $100 = $160."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's age when he turns 24 as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that E = 24. 

Since Emil will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, we can write the equation: E = 0.5D. 

Substituting E = 24 into the equation, we get: 24 = 0.5D. 

Solving for D, we get: D = 24 / 0.5 = 48. 

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24, we can write the equation: E = 2B. 

Substituting E = 24 into the equation, we get: 24 = 2B. 

Solving for B, we get: B = 24 / 2 = 12. 

Now that we have the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil turns 24, we need to find their current ages. 

Emil's dad's current age is D - 5 = 48 - 5 = 43. 

Emil's brother's current age is B - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. 

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend: 
20 + 30 + 40 = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by 3: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of football players, we need to calculate 20% of 30 students. 
20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

The remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Now, we need to find 25% of the remaining students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders/band members.
Total students leaving early = 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, we multiply 5 by 5 to get Charlie's boot size: 5 * 5 = 25.

Now, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2 to find the average: (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find the total space taken up by the plants and the space between them. 

Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. The total space taken up by the plants is 12n inches. The total space between the plants is 1.5 * (n - 1) feet, which is equal to 18 * (n - 1) inches.

The total length of the flower bed is the sum of the space taken up by the plants and the space between them. 

1332 = 12n + 18(n - 1)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
1332 = 12n + 18n - 18
1332 = 30n - 18
1332 + 18 = 30n
1350 = 30n
n = 1350 / 30
n = 45

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of flowers she needs to buy is 45 - 17 = 28.

The cost of each plant is $6, so the total cost is 28 * 6 = $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 / 1 = 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year. 

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 30 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect in 2 hours is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is the sum of the cooling effects minus the warming effect: 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. 

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet 'x'. Then, the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years. So, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet plus 75 years is equal to the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Therefore, x + 75 = 3x.

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting x from both sides of the equation: 
x + 75 - x = 3x - x
75 = 2x

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: 
75 / 2 = 2x / 2
37.5 = x

Now that we know the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet, we can find the age of Bill when his dad saw the comet. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, the age of Bill when his dad saw the comet is 30 - 37.5 = -7.5 years old. However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is x is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years. So, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet plus 75 years is equal to the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Let's call the age of Bill when his dad saw the comet 'y'. Then, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is y - 75. 

Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time is 3(y - 75).

We know that the time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years. So, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet plus 75 years is equal to the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Therefore, y - 75 + 75 = 3(y - 75)

Now, we can simplify the equation: 
y = 3(y - 75)

Now, we can solve for y by distributing the 3: 
y = 3y - 225

Now, we can solve for y by subtracting 3y from both sides of the equation: 
y - 3y = -225
-2y = -225

Now, we can solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by -2: 
-2y / -2 = -225 / -2
y = 112.5

Now that we know the age of Bill when his dad saw the comet, we can find the age of Bill when his dad saw the comet. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, the age of Bill when his dad saw the comet is 30 - 112.5 = -82.5 years old. However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that the age of Bill when his dad saw the comet is y is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years. So, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet plus 75 years is equal to the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time.

Therefore, y - 75 + 75 = 3(y - 75)

Now, we can simplify the equation: 
y = 3(y - 75)

Now, we can solve for y by distributing the 3: 
y = 3y - 225

Now, we can solve for y by subtracting 3y from both sides of the equation: 
y - 3y = -225
-2y = -225

Now, we can solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by -2: 
-2y / -2 = -225 / -2
y = 112.5

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

In total, Adam received $6 from his mother and $12 from his father, which is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we need to subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

So, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W'. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can express Helene's age as 2 * (average age of the group). 

The total age of the group is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. So, we can write the equation as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = Total age of the group
3 + 4 + 2 * (average age of the group) + W = 20

We also know that the average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. So, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5.

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:
3 + 4 + 2 * 5 + W = 20
7 + 10 + W = 20
17 + W = 20

To find the age of Wilfred, we need to isolate W. 
W = 20 - 17
W = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected by Walter before his friend donates $200. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend donates $200, but we don't need to include this in the total because the lawyer's donation is based on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is $2000, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to first find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies each person got
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of people is 6. 

Let's say each kid gets 'y' slices. Since each adult gets twice as big a slice as each kid, each adult gets 2y slices. 

The total number of slices given to the kids is 4y (since there are 4 kids) and the total number of slices given to the adults is 2 * 2y = 4y (since there are 2 adults).

The total number of slices given to the family is 4y + 4y = 8y, which is equal to the total number of slices 'x'. 

So, we have 8y = x.

The total number of slices given to each adult is 4y. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find (4y/x) * 100.

Substituting 8y for x, we get (4y/8y) * 100 = (1/2) * 100 = 50%.

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Converting 300 minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours to find the time left for updating records:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is 8."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation 8x = 64. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 64 / 8 = 8.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it is rented 3 * 4 = 12 times in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

The total cost per month is $40 * 12 sessions = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are equal to the total cost per month, which is $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We are given that this total is 64, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'. Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y. We are given that this total is 56, so we can write the equation:

7y = 56

To find the value of 'y', we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box:

Difference = 16 - 8
Difference = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population of porcupines:

50 (initial population) + 1440 (babies born) = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Total students = 3000

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16
Number of female students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16
Number of female students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750

Total female students = Number of female students over 16 + Number of female students under 16
Total female students = 1125 + 750
Total female students = 1875

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run. 

Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. 

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the initial charge of the power bank be x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for the down payment. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $.5 each will be 3 * $.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $.5 each will be 4 * $.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $.75 each will be 5 * $.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

He started with $10, so he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $.25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we divide the number of packs by 10: 13 / 10 = 1.3 packs per friend.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply 1.3 by 60: 1.3 * 60 = 78.

However, since we can't divide a pack into fractions, we need to find out how many pieces each friend received from a whole pack and the remaining pieces from the other packs. 

Each friend received 1 whole pack, which is 60 pieces. The remaining 3 packs (13 - 10 = 3) were divided among 10 friends, so each friend received 3 / 10 = 0.3 packs. 

0.3 packs * 60 pieces = 18 pieces. 

So, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the information given. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total. She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. This means each album has 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

Since 2 albums were portraits only, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 18 = 45.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 + 15 = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 + 7 = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 + 37 = 74.

The final answer is: 74"

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

40% of the 60 questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are (60 - 24) / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions.

So, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 + 9 = 36.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is L and the number of small stuffed animals sold is S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. We can set up an equation based on the total earnings:

(Large stuffed animals) * (Price of large stuffed animal) + (Small stuffed animals) * (Price of small stuffed animal) = Total earnings
L * $12 + S * $4 = $120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation:
L * $12 + 2L * $4 = $120

Combine like terms:
L * $12 + $8L = $120

Combine the L terms:
(12L + 8L) = $120
20L = $120

Divide both sides by 20:
L = $120 / 20
L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:
S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 pounds by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 pounds by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches: 6/4 = 1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set.

First, let's calculate the amount Tom paid from his old bedroom set: 
$3000 (total cost) - $1000 (amount paid) = $2000 (remaining amount to be paid)

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 
10% = 10 / 100 = 0.1

Now, we multiply the remaining amount by the decimal to find the monthly payment: 
$2000 * 0.1 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally had before adding the blue balloons: 15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons = 28 balloons.

Adding the 6 blue balloons, Sally had 28 + 6 = 34 balloons in total.

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the last scenario is dependent on the first two not happening. So, we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her, which is 60% (100% - 40%) * 80% (100% - 20%). 

Now, we can find the total probability of the first two scenarios happening: 50% + 40% = 90%. 

The probability of the last scenario is 60% * 20% = 12%. 

Now, we add the probabilities of the first two scenarios and the last scenario: 90% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since probabilities cannot exceed 100%. This is because we've counted the scenario where the normal teacher gives everyone an extension and Marcus convinces her as part of the first two scenarios. 

So, we need to subtract the probability of this scenario from the total probability of the first two scenarios: 90% - 40% = 50%. 

Now, we add the probability of the last scenario to this: 50% + 12% = 62%. 

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 62% = 38%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to find out how many seats are available for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats available for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive. There are 950 graduates, and they will share the 4750 available seats. 

Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

"Let's break down the information given:

1. It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, the number of small beans he can eat is equal to the number of medium-sized beans multiplied by 3. 

Now, let's calculate the number of small beans he can eat: 
150 (medium-sized beans) * 3 (small beans per medium-sized bean) = 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses = 45 - 9 = $36.

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly wage after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: Hourly wage = Net earnings / Total hours worked = 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

The total amount spent is 66 dollars.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many bottles of soda he will place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find out how many bottles of soda Richard will place along the driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. 

Number of bottles = Total width of the driveway / Distance between each bottle
Number of bottles = 24 / 3
Number of bottles = 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to go to 7 more bottles (8 total bottles - 1 for the starting point). 

Time taken to go from one bottle to the next = 5 seconds
Total time taken = Number of bottles - 1 (since he starts at the first bottle) * Time taken to go from one bottle to the next
Total time taken = 7 * 5
Total time taken = 35 seconds

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working for 4 years is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so it's 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he needs 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, he lost $5.
On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
Twice the amount he previously lost is 2 * $5 = $10. 
$1 more than that is $10 + $1 = $11. 
So, on the second race, he won $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
1.5 times the amount he won in the second race is 1.5 * $11 = $16.5. 
So, on the third race, he lost $16.5.

The total amount lost is $5 + $16.5 = $21.5. 
The number of races is 3.

The average amount lost is $21.5 / 3 = $7.17.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find 3/8ths of 21 days. 

To do this, we can multiply 21 by 3/8. 

First, we multiply 21 by 3: 21 * 3 = 63. 

Then, we divide 63 by 8: 63 / 8 = 7.875.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 by 24 to find the total hours worked: 7.875 * 24 = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter: 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and isolate x. Multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Expanding the equation: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

In 2008, the price of the car depreciates by 21% of $20000:
Price in 2008 = $20000 - (21% of $20000)
= $20000 - 0.21 * $20000
= $20000 - $4200
= $15800

In 2009, the price of the car depreciates by 21% of $15800:
Price in 2009 = $15800 - (21% of $15800)
= $15800 - 0.21 * $15800
= $15800 - $3316
= $12484

In 2010, the price of the car depreciates by 21% of $12484:
Price in 2010 = $12484 - (21% of $12484)
= $12484 - 0.21 * $12484
= $12484 - $2623.64
= $9860.36

The price of the car in 2010 is $9860.36."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, so that's 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books. 

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - (Number of English books + Number of German books)

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed has 1 set of sheets and the king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since each twin set of sheets is washed separately, we need to calculate the number of twin sets. There are 4 twin beds, so 4 sets of twin sheets are washed. 

The total number of sheets washed per week is 4 (twin sets) + 1 (king set) = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we need to find the number of loads for each type of sheet. For twin sets, 4 sets / 2 sets per load = 2 loads. For the king set, 1 set / 1 set per load = 1 load.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin loads) + 1 (king load) = 3 loads.

To find the total number of loads in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

He wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he wants to send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is the sum of the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons: 3500 + 21000 = 23500 cents.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter as follows:

- For the first 3 pounds, Dennis will pay full price: 3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00
- For the next 3 pounds, Dennis will get one half off: 3 pounds * $2.00/pound (half of $4.00) = $6.00

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total number of guests, we need to add the number of classmates, dance class members, and family members, then subtract the number of people who said they could not come. 

Total guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (could not come) = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 

Additional guests = Total guests - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is $6 per guest, so we multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per guest.

Cost for additional guests = 21 * 6 = 126

Now, we add the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost.

Total cost = Initial fee + Cost for additional guests = 125 + 126 = 251

The final answer is: 251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, she now has 3/4 * $60 = $45.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she had $60, she now has 2/3 * $60 = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total bananas bought = 315
- First monkey eats 10 bananas each day
- Second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day
- The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to find out how many bananas are left after the first two monkeys eat their share.

Total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day = 10 + 14 = 24 bananas

Now, let's find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey:

Total bananas - Total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys = Bananas left for the third monkey
315 - 24 = 291 bananas

So, the third monkey eats 291 bananas each day."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total sales from milkshakes:
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the total sales from burger platters:
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Now, let's calculate the total sales from sodas:
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Finally, let's add the total sales from each item together:
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is not given, we assume it is 0 minutes. Paul will wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. 

The final answer is: 145"
"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
So, the total number of toothpicks saved = 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, she needs to save 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs to save by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 
80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * 2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 1500 = $1800.

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which he bought it, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought it is $2000 - $1800 = $200.

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of jellyfish each spring creates per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in 4 hours. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, each spring will create 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours.

There are 5 springs working at the same rate, so the total number of jellyfish created will be 5 times the number of jellyfish created by one spring.

5 * 14400 = 72000

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score, so we add 15 to 180. 

Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip distance. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can find the total time taken by dividing the total distance by his speed. 

Time = Total Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"To find out how much Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet. 

Since they have a total of 100 feet of fence, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to first find out how many inches it grows per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 
8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now that we know the growth rate per year, we can multiply this rate by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years:
2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's break down the information given:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: Half of 300 = 150
- BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes: Total bikes - (Trekking bikes + BMX bikes) = 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * ($500 / 2) = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to find the total minutes he spends in a day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes in a day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class in a week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is (1/16) * 1200 = 75 minutes. 

Since he spends the same amount of time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to divide 75 by 2 to get the minutes he spends on each day. 75 / 2 = 37.5 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1200 + 37.5 + 37.5 = 1275 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 1275 / 60 = 21.25 hours.

The final answer is: 21.25"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to first find the height of the ball after the first bounce. 

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet. 

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

The height of the ball on its second bounce will be 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors ate. So, the velociraptors ate the other half, which is also 270 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex must have eaten the other half. This means the T-Rex ate 270 kilograms, and the triceratops had double that amount before the T-Rex ate.

So, the original weight of the triceratops is 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas.

Probability = (Number of shaken sodas) / (Total number of sodas)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they have traveled, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps. 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he helps per day. 
2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day

12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. 

But, we can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars and the people who were already inside the church. 

However, the question does not provide the number of people who were already inside the church. 

But, we can assume that the question is asking for the number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36

"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 
40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:
$40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Now, let's calculate how much she saves per year. 
20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves per year:
$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to subtract this from the total number of years:
40 - 20 = 20 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years to save for her retirement."

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles she hikes per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since she only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract the number of days she has from the number of days it will take her to complete her journey: 37.2 - 30 = 7.2 days.

Since she can't hike a fraction of a day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey in 30 days. We can do this by dividing the extra days by the number of days she has: 7.2 / 30 = 0.24 days.

Since she hikes twice a day, we multiply the extra days by 2: 0.24 * 2 = 0.48 days.

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we multiply the extra days by the miles she hikes per day: 0.48 * 250 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each type of ball and add them together.

Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Now, to find out how much James will have left, we subtract the total taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he spent. 

He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Initially, Raymond had $21. After saving $11, he had $21 + $11 = $32. 

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount he had after saving: $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's break down the information given:

Anna's initial budget: $16
Amount spent so far: $4
Remaining budget: $16 - $4 = $12
Anna has $2 left after buying 2 books, so the total cost of the 2 books is $12 - $2 = $10.

Since both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total cost by 2 to find the cost of each book:
$10 / 2 = $5

The cost of each book is $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.2 x 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

The total number of students enrolled this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find out how many times the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find out the number of blinks per minute, we divide the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial and additional numbers of each type.

Initial male guppies: 4
Additional male guppies: 2
Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6

Initial female guppies: 7
Additional female guppies: 1
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8

Initial male goldfishes: 3
Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
Difference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes
Difference = 16 - 11
Difference = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time taken by each person and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time taken by each person: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip and multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how far Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk a total of 7 * 10 = 70 miles in 7 days.

It's given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half of that distance. 

To find Brian's distance, we divide Sofie's total distance by 2: 70 / 2 = 35 miles.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers, we need to calculate the production rate of each group and then add them together.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.
The total production rate of the first 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the total order is 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of both Elijah and Kory's dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kris had 7 stickers, which is half of what Luis had. So, Luis had 7 x 2 = 14 stickers.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can find the total number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers by dividing 20,000 by 400.

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

The average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so the 2nd fastest car's speed is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so the faster car's speed is 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, two years ago, Vince's age was 14 / 2 = 7 years.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number 'x'. 
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted 'y'. Then, Camden painted y + 12 eggs.
3. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: y + (y + 12) = 30
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2y + 12 = 30
5. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 2y = 18
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: y = 9
7. So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
8. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden painted 21 eggs, we can conclude that Arnold and Madeline each painted 21 - 12 = 9 eggs less than Camden.
9. However, the question asks how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden painted 21 eggs, we can conclude that Camden painted 21 - 9 = 12 more eggs than Arnold.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. 

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons = Total number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

The total weight of the crayons and boxes = Total weight of the boxes + Total weight of the crayons
= 200 + 200
= 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds = Total weight in ounces / 16
= 400 / 16
= 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we need to divide the total length by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can make is:

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours, which is equal to 2/x * 60 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

The time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x) hours, which is equal to 1/(2x) * 60 minutes.

We know that the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2/x * 60 = 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x and divide both sides by 60:

2 * 60 = 40x
120 = 40x
x = 120/40
x = 3

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach:

Time on the beach = 2/x * 60
= 2/3 * 60
= 40 minutes

The time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is:

Time on the sidewalk = 1/(2x) * 60
= 1/(2*3) * 60
= 10 minutes

The total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
= 40 + 10
= 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount. 

28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the temperatures of the two mugs. 

The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

33 + x ≥ 80

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x ≥ 47

So, the second bottle must be at least 47 degrees.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows (initial) + 420 cows (added) = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens (initial) + 210 chickens (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the original price. 

The original price of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to find out how many scoops 1 potato makes. 

It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 1 potato makes 2/3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, which is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops. 

Now, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to divide the number of scoops by the number of scoops 1 potato makes. 

18 scoops / (2/3 scoops per potato) = 18 * (3/2) = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 / 12 = 20.

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained on the bus is: 54 - 20 = 34

"Let's break down the information given:

- The cost of a sunflower is $2.
- The cost of a bouquet is $8, which contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from the bouquets. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and he earns $56 from bouquets per day, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the daily earnings from bouquets by the cost of a bouquet:

Number of bouquets sold per day = Daily earnings from bouquets / Cost of a bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7

Now, we know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:

Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets = Number of bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
= 7 * 12
= 84

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from individual sunflowers. We know that he earns $26 from sunflowers per day, and each sunflower costs $2. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sunflowers is:

Number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sunflowers = Daily earnings from sunflowers / Cost of a sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individual sunflowers:

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets + Number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sunflowers
= 84 + 13
= 97

Since we want to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * 3
= 97 * 3
= 291

Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:
60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7, so the total amount of money he makes from selling 12 rocks is:
12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

Adam initially had $100, so to find out how much he loses, we subtract the amount he made from the initial amount:
$100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The day count for each type of scene is not the same, so we need to find the maximum day count among them. The maximum day count is 9 days.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for a month. 

First, we need to find out how many days are in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the total cost per day is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30: 
30 - 24 = 6

Now, Patricia has 6 roses. Then, she bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add 15 to 6: 
6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses. 

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as 'x'. Then, Jim collected x + 5 seashells.

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'y'. Then, Carlos collected 2y seashells.

Since Jim collected x + 5 seashells and Carlos collected 2y seashells, and we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, we can equate x + 5 to 27 and solve for x.

x + 5 = 27
x = 22

Now we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can equate 2y to 22 and solve for y.

2y = 22
y = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. 

Total seashells = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60

To find out how many seashells each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to first find Carl's height. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of the cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100/20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required:

11500 - 4200 = 7300

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since they are octuplets).

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing purple and bows = 1/3 * 6 = 2
Number of babies wearing blue and bows = 2

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 + 2 = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
= 5168 - (1907 + 2136)

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So, the total amount of land sold so far is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. This means he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Total eggs found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Initial number of eggs = 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes, we multiply the number of apartments in each by 2: 200 * 2 = 400. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6: 400 * 0.6 = 240. Then we add 240 to 400: 400 + 240 = 640. 

So, the total number of apartments in all three complexes is 400 + 640 = 1040.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so we multiply the number of apartments he collects from per week by his pay per collection: 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we know that a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. We can use this information to find the production of an 8-year-old tree. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total production of fruits for the first 4 years:
- Year 1: 50 fruits
- Year 2: 150 fruits
- Year 3: 350 fruits
- Year 4: 800 fruits
Total production for the first 4 years = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 = 1350 fruits

Now, we can calculate the total production of fruits for the entire 10 years:
- Total production for the first 4 years: 1350 fruits
- Year 5: 0 fruits
- Year 6: 1000 fruits
- Year 7: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits
Total production for the entire 10 years = 1350 + 0 + 1000 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 4400 fruits

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express R in terms of Y: R = 4(Y - 7)

We are also given that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4(Y - 7) and B = Y - 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get:
4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37

Combine like terms:
4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37

Combine like terms:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, let's isolate y:

5y = 15x - 12x
5y = 3x
y = (3/5)x

Now that we know y, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's money left = x - y
= x - (3/5)x
= (2/5)x

We are given that Ronnie was given $5 initially, so x = 5. 

Ronnie's money left = (2/5)(5)
= 2

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (since 12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12 and then divide that by 12.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide 120 by 12.

120 / 12 = 10

So, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new box for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he has is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is $20, tripling his money means he now has 3 * 20 = $60 per bill. So, he now has 20 * 60 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount by 5: 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide it by the amount of chalk used each day.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

The teacher then goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. 

To find out how many days the chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day.

20% of 1 inch = 0.2 * 1 = 0.2 inches

Now, divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day:

2.75 inches / 0.2 inches per day = 13.75 days

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. 

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, let's add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds and how many melt in a given time period. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 60 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he builds 20/60 * 15 = 5 snowballs. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, Jay has 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs left.

Now, let's calculate how many snowballs Jay has after 1 hour (60 minutes). In 60 minutes, Jay builds 20 snowballs and 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt (since 2 melt every 15 minutes, and there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour). So, Jay has 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs after 1 hour.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, he needs 60 - 12 = 48 more snowballs to reach 60. 

Now, let's calculate how many 15-minute intervals it will take to build 48 more snowballs. In each 15-minute interval, Jay builds 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs. So, to build 48 snowballs, it will take 48 / 3 = 16 intervals of 15 minutes.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, it will take 16 * 15 = 240 minutes to build 48 more snowballs.

In total, it will take 1 hour (60 minutes) to build 12 snowballs and 240 minutes to build 48 more snowballs. So, the total time it will take is 60 + 240 = 300 minutes.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's age, we need to first find out how old John was 20 years ago. 

John's current age is 28, so 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, Jim's age 20 years ago was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 (since they ordered 2 packs of 50) - 25 bandages.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total earnings from working and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. 
Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. 
There are 4 weeks in April, so she works 4 weeks * 6 days/week = 24 days in April.
Total hours worked = 7.5 hours/day * 24 days = 180 hours.

Now, let's calculate her earnings from working. 
Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from working = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Since Jen did not incur any absences for April, she will receive the attendance bonus of $10.

Total earnings = Earnings from working + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to find the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens, which is 25 + 50 = 75.

"To find the total cost, we first need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600. So, the cost of one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of one bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of one bottle of scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of 20 bottles of cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of scotch and cognac is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees becomes 20 + 10 = 30. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees becomes 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days. The total number of White Oak trees is 30, and the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 50. 

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 30 + 50 = 80."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge be x.

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can write this as an equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed (which is not given). However, we can find the percentage difference.

Percentage difference = ((True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed) / True number of red jelly beans) * 100

Since the number of red jelly beans he guessed is not given, we can't calculate the exact percentage difference. However, we can find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans that would be expected if the jelly beans were packed with 100% efficiency and 30% were red.

Number of red jelly beans with 100% efficiency = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans with 100% efficiency = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans with 100% efficiency = 864

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans with 100% efficiency
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The difference is 36."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years separately and then add them together.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year. The initial cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is:
3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is:
$2 * 2.5 = $5

For the next 3 years, Pauline still visited the museum 3 times a year. The new cost of one visit is $5. So, the total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let the length of the shorter piece be x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet. 

We can write an equation to represent this situation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying 8 by 4: 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for both manicure and pedicure is 20% of $75, which is 0.2 * $75 = $15.

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost is the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given steps.

1. The initial price of the toy in November is $40.
2. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 1.8 = 2.8, or 100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 80/100 = 1.8).
   New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72.
3. In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, or 100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 50/100 = 0.5).
   New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. 
Total amount from standard rate lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount from his standard rate. 
First, we need to find the reduced rate. 
Reduced rate = $80 - (25% of $80) 
= $80 - (0.25 * $80) 
= $80 - $20 
= $60

Total amount from reduced rate lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the total amount from standard rate lessons and reduced rate lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make.
Total amount = $320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to find out how many pomelos 1/4 of 20 is. 

1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. 

Since Eve originally had 20 pomelos, the number of pomelos she gave away is 20 - 5 = 15.

"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

Number of apples sold = 27
Price per apple = $3
Total money received = Number of apples sold * Price per apple
Total money received = 27 * 3
Total money received = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and 4 is the reciprocal of 3/4).

Regina wrote 9 novels last year. 

Since 9 novels is 3/4 of the total number of novels she wrote this year, we can set up the equation: 9 = (3/4) * x, where x is the total number of novels she wrote this year.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate x: x = 9 * (4/3).

x = 9 * 4 / 3
x = 36 / 3
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. 

The final answer is: 12"

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael travels for 3 * 24 = 72 hours in 3 days. 

Now, we multiply his average speed by the total hours he travels: 
50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the distance covered by Michael. To do this, we divide the distance covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiply by 100.

(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. 
Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by the family is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since Madeline ate 6 grapes initially, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

The final answer is: 90"

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

The total cost per year is $10.00 (weekly cost) * 52 (weeks in a year) = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The total time they have to clean is 5 days. Since they work 8 hours a day, the total time they have to clean is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

The total time it takes to clean all the classrooms is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold: 
10 (middle shelf 1) + 10 (middle shelf 2) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are required to hold all of them. 
To do this, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold: 
110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost price and the total selling price of the eggs.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. So, the total cost price is:
5 * $2.40 = $12

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. So, the selling price for 60 eggs will be:
60 / 3 * $1 = $20

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 
60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right. 
70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right. 
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

We know that B = 5S - 4. 

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

For the rooms, half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms in total, half of them is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it is 2 * 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it is 54 / 2 = 27.

The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since there are 232 candies in total, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add the individual weights together. 

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

Force needed = 1% of 1600
Force needed = (1/100) * 1600
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600
Force needed = 16 pounds

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed they eat in a day is 5 * 8 = 40 pounds.

In a week, there are 7 days, so the total amount of feed they eat in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa would run 1 mile in 2x minutes. 

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance Vanessa did (since Vanessa ran twice as far), we can set up the equation: 

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did, so his time is doubled)

Solving for x, we get: 
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we multiply the time it takes her to run 1 mile by 4:
16 * 4 = 64 minutes

2. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old now.
3. James is the son of John, and John had James when he was 19. This means John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.
5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original cost. 
20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the total labor cost is $50 x 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve the first equation for W:

W = 20 - C

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expand the equation:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
