"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts of white fiber, we need to calculate half of the bolts of blue fiber. 

Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, half of that would be 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, the total number of bolts of white fiber is 1. 

Now, to find the total number of bolts, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's calculate the new value of the house: 
New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = Original price + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James has 3 sprint sessions in a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, we subtract the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. 

60 - 40 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017929504, $0.010757904, $0.006454144, $0.0038272864, $0.002306372224, $0.00137362293.6.

To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017929504 + $0.010757904 + $0.006454144 + $0.0038272864 + $0.002306372224 + $0.00137362293.6

Total cost ≈ $25.00

"To find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to install the updates:
The time to install the updates is given as 20 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB at 2 GB/minute is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes

The total time is the sum of the time to download the first 40% of the file, the time to install the updates, and the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:
Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 3 hours, John drove at 60 mph:
Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

For the first 2 hours of the return trip, John was stuck in standstill traffic, so he didn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

For the next half-hour, John drove at 30 mph:
Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 2.5 hours of the return trip, John drove at 80 mph:
Distance = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 200 = 215 miles

Since John was driving back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from home to the point where he turned around (180 miles) from the total distance he traveled in the return trip (215 miles) to find the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours:
Distance from home = 215 - 180 = 35 miles

The final answer is: 35"
"To find Eliza's total earnings, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Her total earnings are:
$400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads for each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90 (initial cost) + $3x (annual maintenance cost).

We set up the equation: $7.5x = $90 + $3x

Subtract $3x from both sides: $4.5x = $90

Divide both sides by $4.5: x = $90 / $4.5
x = 20

Since x represents the number of years, it will take 20 years for the tree to start earning money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all the houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(8 / 20) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each investment. 

Let's assume the merchant buys the jewelry and sells it at the end of the month. The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as follows:

Future Value of Jewelry = Current Value x (1 + Rate of Increase)
= $5,000 x (1 + 0.025)
= $5,000 x 1.025
= $5,125

Now, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:

Future Value of Electronic Gadgets = Current Value x (1 + Rate of Increase)
= $8,000 x (1 + 0.012)
= $8,000 x 1.012
= $8,096

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the investment with the higher future value. In this case, the electronic gadgets have a higher future value, so he should choose the electronic gadgets.

The profit can be calculated as follows:

Profit = Future Value - Current Value
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To determine the distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to consider the total distance traveled in each direction. 

Since both trains travel the same distance in the same direction, we can assume that they are traveling at the same speed. 

In the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. 

In the second day, both trains travel 150 miles northward. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we add the distances traveled in each direction. 

Total distance = 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

Since both trains travel the same distance, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Earnings from teaching: 
- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Earnings from coaching: 
- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15

"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, so in a week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa needs to complete the hike, we first need to find the total time she has already taken and the total time she needs to take to achieve her desired average speed.

She has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles).

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find the total time she needs to take, we can divide the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already taken 2 hours, she needs to take 3 - 2 = 1 more hour to complete the hike.

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we need to subtract the 1 liter that was spilled from the orange drink. 

The remaining amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

Now, we add the water from the orange and pineapple drinks to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters.

Total water = 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

However, we need to add the remaining 4 liters of the orange drink to the total volume of the mixture. 

The remaining 4 liters of the orange drink is (10 - 6) = 4 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the remaining 4 liters of the orange drink is (2/3) * 4 = 8/3 = 2.67 liters.

Now, we add the water from the remaining 4 liters of the orange drink to the total amount of water.

Total water = 14.67 + 2.67 = 17.34 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17.34}$"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to first determine Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so we need to find the difference between his current age and the age at which he had a son. 

25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age at which he had a son) = 2 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

Cost of chicken meal: $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Now, we need to find the number of boxes of pizza. Each box costs $8.50, so we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of one box to find the number of boxes.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so the total number of cartons she buys is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total amount she spends is 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 60 miles - 45 miles
Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the second stop, but we need to find the distance traveled between the two stops, not the distance between the stops themselves. Since Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Distance traveled between the two stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop - Distance of the first stop
Distance traveled between the two stops = 15 miles - 20 miles
Distance traveled between the two stops = -5 miles

However, the distance cannot be negative, as it is a distance. This means that Henry must have traveled in the opposite direction of the second stop. To find the correct distance, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the total distance and then subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance traveled between the two stops = Total distance - Distance of the first stop - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
Distance traveled between the two stops = 60 miles - 20 miles - 45 miles
Distance traveled between the two stops = -5 miles

However, this is still a negative number. To find the correct distance, we need to add the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip to the total distance and then subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Distance traveled between the two stops = Total distance + Distance of the first stop + Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop to the second stop
Distance traveled between the two stops = 60 miles + 20 miles + 45 miles - 15 miles
Distance traveled between the two stops = 110 miles - 15 miles
Distance traveled between the two stops = 95 miles

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to find the distance between the two stops, not the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. To find the correct distance, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop and then add the distance of the first stop.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 15 miles
Distance of the first stop = 20 miles

Distance traveled between the two stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop + Distance of the first stop
Distance traveled between the two stops = 15 miles + 20 miles
Distance traveled between the two stops = 35 miles

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- The two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots.
- One pair of heels costs $33.
- The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair.

Since the second pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, the cost of the second pair is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots, the cost of the boots is $99 + $5 = $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume the common ratio is x. Then, Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, then 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time spent on each dog: 0.5 hours

Total time spent per day = Number of dogs * Time spent on each dog
Total time spent per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time spent per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time spent per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time spent per week = Total time spent per day * 7
Total time spent per week = 5 * 7

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins) and that the total number of coins is 110 (G + S = 110).

We can substitute the first equation into the second one: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G: G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25 (which is 25% as a decimal). 

4 * 0.25 = 1

So, Mike scored 1 more point in the second 20 minutes than in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods to find the total points.

Total points = 4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first calculate how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then determine the cost of those yogurts.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of one yogurt, we divide $5.00 by 4: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games: $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made: $195 - $165 = $30.

However, this is the money he made from selling the Lego sets, not the number of Lego sets he sold. To find the number of Lego sets he sold, we can divide the money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set: $30 / $15 = 2.

Since John started with 13 Lego sets, we can find out how many Lego sets he still has by subtracting the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets he had: 13 - 2 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance (60 miles) by the total time (18 hours): 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can determine her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Dana's running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can determine her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Dana's walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. 

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to first find the age of Ben's iPhone. 

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. However, we need to find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames. 

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = Distance with gemstone - Distance of the dragon's flames
= 1200 - 1000
= 200 feet

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still consume by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles (2 sets of 10 candles). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to determine how many Post-it notes she had at the end of her day. 

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. She placed 220 Post-it notes on the cups of coffee at work. After that, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. 

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end of her day is 80 (initial) + 23 (remaining) = 103 Post-it notes.

Since she placed 220 Post-it notes on the cups of coffee, the number of Post-it notes she had at the end of her day (103) is the sum of the Post-it notes she initially had (80) and the Post-it notes in the package she purchased (x). 

We can set up the equation: 80 + x = 103.

To find x, we subtract 80 from both sides of the equation: x = 103 - 80.

x = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the total cost of the red ties.

First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can calculate the cost of each red tie as follows:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on all ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on all ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total revenue per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

First, let's find the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he traveled at 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. However, we don't know the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, we can assume he traveled for 3 hours. 

distance = speed * time
distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the time he spent traveling back. We know the distance is 30 miles and his speed is 6 miles per hour. 

time = distance / speed
time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
time = 5 hours

So, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM) + 5 hours (back) = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

Thursday: 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 car tires * $40/car tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Friday: 
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $0
- Revenue from car tires: 12 car tires * $40/car tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

Since the revenue on Thursday ($520) is higher than the revenue on Friday ($480), we need to find the difference between the two revenues.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level below it has half the square footage, the second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage. The third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage, and the fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

The total square footage of all levels is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. 

The average square footage of a level is 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. 
The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days.

Total cups of dog food in the first year = (1 cup/day * 180 days) + (2 cups/day * 185 days)
= 180 + 370
= 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

To find the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price, we multiply the number of flowers by the cost per flower: 18 * $0.5 = $9.

To find the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the original price, we need to find the number of packages of 3 flowers and the number of packages of 2 flowers that make up 18 flowers. Since 18 is not divisible by 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers (18 - 6 = 12, which is divisible by 2) and 6 packages of 2 flowers. The total cost for the 6 packages of 3 flowers is 6 * $2.50 = $15. The total cost for the 6 packages of 2 flowers is 6 * $1 = $6. The total cost for 18 flowers at the original price is $15 + $6 = $21.

The amount of money saved by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $21 - $9 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

Original price: $100

"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters for each girl. 

1/6 of 24 liters = 24 / 6 = 4 liters per girl.

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water was left.

24 - 8 = 16 liters.

Then, we subtract the 6 liters the boy got from the remaining 16 liters.

16 - 6 = 10 liters.

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To find the number of games the team won, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of games they lost as L and the number of games they won as W.

We know that the team played a total of 22 games, so the sum of the games they won and lost is equal to 22:

W + L = 22

We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write an equation based on this information:

W = L + 8

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

L + 8 + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting L into the second equation:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next three years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply this increase to the salary after 5 years.

Salary after 6 years: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726
Salary after 7 years: $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + (10% of $798.60) = $798.60 + 0.1 * $798.60 = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

The annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46."

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests: 16
Number of guests who don't show up: 16 * 1/4 = 4
Number of guests who will attend: 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed: 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag: $2
Total cost: 9 * $2 = $18

"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time, since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time is 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 40 and add it to 40.

10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 168 + 60 + 120
= 348

"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes and the number of cars that took an exit from the total number of cars.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

The total number of cars is 30. 
5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 
So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes (x) plus the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes (20) is equal to the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam (25).

x + 20 = 25

1. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.
2. This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback rewards are $.20 per gallon, and the person buys 10 gallons.

Total cashback rewards = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback rewards = $.20 * 10
Total cashback rewards = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Since 20 feet is twice 10 feet, the boat took on twice the amount of water, which is 2 x 2 = 4 liters in 16 seconds.

Now, we need to find the rate of water intake per second. To do this, we divide the amount of water taken on (4 liters) by the time taken (16 seconds).

Rate of water intake per second = 4 liters / 16 seconds = 0.25 liters per second.

Now, we know it took 64 seconds to reach the shore. To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the rate of water intake per second by the total time taken to reach the shore.

Total water taken on = 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds = 16 liters.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50x, where x is the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, and this is equal to 20 parts of the ratio. To find the value of one part, we divide 120 by 20, which is 6.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 7 parts, and each part is equal to 6. So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 7 * 6 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the total number of shoes and then multiply it by the cost per shoe.

John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, so the total number of shoes is 2 * 3 = 6.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's original salary and then find their salaries four years later.

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago can be found by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.3 (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3).

Lylah's salary four years ago = $40000 / 1.3 = $30769.23

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we need to multiply his original salary by 1.4 (since 100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4).

Adrien's salary four years later = $40000 * 1.4 = $56000

Lylah's salary also increased by 40% over the same period. To find her new salary, we multiply her original salary by 1.4.

Lylah's salary four years later = $30769.23 * 1.4 = $43056.522

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later = $56000 + $43056.522 = $99056.522

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep pattern.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

There are 5 days in the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), so the total hours she slept in those days is 5 * 7 = 35 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept throughout the week:

Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 * 6 = 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 35 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs in the first 3 hours and the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance she covers in 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. So, the distance she covers in 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped to find the original number of letters in the already-stamped pile.

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps and she puts stamps on one-third of them. 

One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20.

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since Jennie added 20 letters to this pile, the original number of letters in the pile was 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors:
   Total patients per day = 500
   Average time per patient = 24 minutes
   Total time spent by doctors per day = 500 * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes
   Convert total time to hours = 12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

2. Calculate the cost of doctors:
   Cost per hour = $150
   Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

3. Calculate the total revenue:
   Total patients per day = 500
   Average time per patient = 24 minutes
   Total time spent by patients per day = 500 * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for the three days: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, we calculate the total number of questions Mark could have completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark had 75 questions in the first test, he completed 40 questions and left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

We calculate the total number of questions Mark could have completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Since Mark had 100 questions in the second test, he completed 30 questions and left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 700 bees in total.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
3. There are twice as many babies as queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From point 3, we know that B = 2Q.

From point 2, we know that W = 2B.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into the equation, we get 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (total income) - $72 (total expenses) = $20

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. The raccoon ate 2/3 of this, which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
6. Now, let's solve for x: 
   (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   (1/3)(x - 30) = 6

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the other baked goods are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, notebooks, and the bond paper separately and then add them together.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.
The cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock from the number of tadpoles that came out from under the lily pad.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. 
6 tadpoles came out from under the lily pad, so now there are 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under the rock, so we subtract 2 from 17: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two-thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3
= 48 / 3
= 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

Initial price = $20
Increase rate = 20% of the original price = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Price after 4 months = $24 + (0.20 * $24) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + (0.20 * $28.80) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + (0.20 * $34.56) = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472
Price after 10 months = $41.472 + (0.20 * $41.472) = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664
Price after 12 months = $49.7664 + (0.20 * $49.7664) = $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have earned if she did her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income she'll lose is:

$35/hour * 3 hours = $105

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

So, the difference between the income she'll lose and the cost of hiring the accountant is:

$105 - $90 = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation (S = 2B):

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants, and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out the total revenue and the total cost. 

Let's start by finding the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the total revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, the total revenue must be $25 + (cost of lemons + cost of sugar). The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, and the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon. 

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'x'. The total revenue is $10x, and the total cost is $3x + $2x = $5x. 

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so we can set up the equation: $10x - $5x = $25. 

Simplifying the equation, we get $5x = $25. 

Dividing both sides by $5, we get x = 5. 

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age would have been 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age would be 21 + 2 = 23.

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team's total time is the sum of each member's time, which is 55 seconds per member. Since there are 4 members, the total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous runner, so the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the less well-rounded team's time from the well-rounded team's time: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to consider the favorable outcomes (4, 5, or 6) out of the total possible outcomes (1 to 6). 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the favorable outcomes (2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6) out of the total possible outcomes (6 * 6 = 36). 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 6/36 = 1/6 = 0.1667 or approximately 16.67%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 16.67% = 33.33%.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to first determine the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces distributed among them.

Let's start by calculating the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and the rabbits. 

There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, the remaining straw pieces are distributed among the rats. So, the total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Now, let's find the total number of rats. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats in each cage can be found by dividing the total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats by the number of straw pieces each rat is given. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Then, the total number of rats is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15.

To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to solve for 'r'. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get r = 15 / 3 = 5.

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transportation is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount of insects needed per day, we first need to find the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock of ducks. 

Since there are 10 ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, the total amount of insects needed per week is:
10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find the amount of insects needed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, then subtract the trees that die.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and subtract that from the amount she has prepared.

Since Violetta needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost of the crayons will be:
5 crayons * $2/crayon = $10

Violetta has prepared $20 for the purchase. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has:
$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

Cost of a pencil: $1.20
Cost of an eraser: $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Mark edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers.
2. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
3. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
4. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, let's say the number of sentences he edits for each publisher is x. Then, the total number of sentences he edits is 2x, which is equal to 1000.

2x = 1000
x = 500

So, Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, and Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

The amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.
The amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his current salary:
5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100
New salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100

Since John works every week of the year, there are 52 weeks in a year. 

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:
Total earnings = New salary * Number of weeks
Total earnings = $2100 * 52
Total earnings = $109,200

Additionally, John received a one-time monetary reward of $5000 for the award.

Total earnings for the year = $109,200 + $5000
Total earnings for the year = $114,200

1. Slices used for sandwiches: 
   - Number of days: 7
   - Slices per sandwich: 2
   - Total slices for sandwiches: 7 * 2 = 14

2. Slices used for omelets: 
   - Number of days: 3

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she had initially and the total number of pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of pens she bought is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66.

Now, we add the total number of pens she had initially (32) to the total number of pens she bought (66) to find the total number of pens she has now: 32 + 66 = 98.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Half a dozen plates cost $6000 each, so the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of each cup is $34800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'x'. Then, the total amount she earns from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20. The total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4x.

The total amount she needs to earn is $70 - $10 (initial savings) = $60.

The equation to represent the situation is: $20 (babysitting) + $4x (mowing) = $60.

Subtracting $20 from both sides of the equation gives us: $4x = $40.

Dividing both sides of the equation by $4 gives us: x = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park:
Length (l) = 6 miles
Width (w) = 1.5 miles

Perimeter = 2(l + w)
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50) = 2x + 50.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. Since the number of customers on the third day is included in this total, we can set up the equation: 2x + 50 + y = 500, where y is the number of customers on the third day.

However, we are trying to find y, and we know that y = x + 50. So we can substitute y with x + 50 in the equation: 2x + 50 + (x + 50) = 500.

Combine like terms: 3x + 100 = 500.

Subtract 100 from both sides: 3x = 400.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 133.33.

Since x is the number of customers on the first day, and we know that the number of customers on the second day is x + 50, the number of customers on the second day is 133.33 + 50 = 183.33.

However, the number of customers on the second day must be a whole number, as it represents the number of people. Therefore, we can round x to the nearest whole number, which is 133.

Now we can find the number of customers on the third day: y = x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183.

The final answer is: 183"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute (4 gallons/minute each).

In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons and the small pool was x gallons, and 32 gallons were lost in total, we can set up the following equation:

2x - 32 + y = 4y

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 32 = 3y

Since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can also set up the following equation:

2x - 32 = 4y

Substituting 2x - 32 = 3y from the first equation into the second equation:

3y = 4y

This equation is not correct, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's re-examine the situation.

The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, and now it has four times as much water as the small pool. This means that the small pool has lost more water than the big pool in the last 4 minutes.

Let's denote the amount of water lost by the small pool as 'a' gallons. Then, the amount of water lost by the big pool is 'a/2' gallons (since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago).

The total amount of water lost by both pools is 32 gallons, so we can set up the following equation:

a + a/2 = 32

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2a + a = 64

Combine like terms:

3a = 64

Divide both sides by 3:

a = 64/3

The small pool lost 64/3 gallons of water. Since the small pool initially had x gallons of water, the amount of water it has now is:

x - 64/3

We are given that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the big pool as 'b' gallons. Then, we can set up the following equation:

b = 4(x - 64/3)

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons. The amount of water lost by the big pool is a/2 = 64/6 gallons. The current amount of water in the big pool is:

2x - 64/6

We can set up the following equation:

2x - 64/6 = 4(x - 64/3)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 64/6 = 4x - 256/3

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

12x - 64 = 24x - 512

Subtract 12x from both sides:

-64 = 12x - 512

Add 512 to both sides:

448 = 12x

Divide both sides by 12:

x = 448/12

x = 37.33

Now that we have the initial amount of water in the small pool, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool:

x - 64/3 = 37.33 - 64/3

First, convert 37.33 to a fraction:

37.33 = 111/3

Now subtract 64/3:

(111/3) - (64/3) = (111 - 64)/3

= 47/3

Multiply the numerator and denominator by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

47/3 * 3/3 = 47/3 * 3 = 47

The current amount of water in the small pool is 47 gallons."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00

"To find the remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and subtract the total amount she borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth borrowed plus the additional 10% interest:

$2000 (initial amount) + 10% of $2000 = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she borrowed plus the interest:

$2200 (total amount borrowed + interest) - $1980 (total paid) = $220

However, this is not the remaining balance. Since Janeth is paying $165 a month, she will still have a balance of $165 after 12 months. To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the total amount she borrowed plus the interest from the total amount she will pay in 12 months:

$1980 (total paid) - $220 (total amount borrowed + interest) = $1760

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to subtract the initial amount borrowed from the total amount she will pay in 12 months:

$1980 (total paid) - $2000 (initial amount) = -$20

However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense. This is because Janeth is paying more than the total amount she borrowed plus the interest. To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the initial amount borrowed from the total amount she will pay in 12 months and then add the interest:

$1980 (total paid) - $2000 (initial amount) = -$20
-$20 + $220 (interest) = $200

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to re-evaluate the problem. Since Janeth is paying $165 a month for 12 months, she will pay a total of $1980. However, she borrowed $2000 plus a 10% interest, which is $2200. Since she is paying less than the total amount she borrowed plus the interest, she will still have a balance.

To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she borrowed plus the interest:

$2200 (total amount borrowed + interest) - $1980 (total paid) = $220

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored.

Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 times the amount of water left in the tank.

Rainwater collected = 2 * 30 = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank to find the total amount of water in the tank.

Total water in the tank = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected
= 30 + 60
= 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. 
Then, we know that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year first. 

The company spent a third of $15000 on advertising for the second year. 
A third of $15000 is calculated as: $15000 / 3 = $5000.

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to get the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.
Total amount spent = $15000 + $5000 = $20000.

The final answer is: $20000"
"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours. The cost for Carlos is 30 * 3 = $90.

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours. The cost for Benji is 18 * 5 = $90.

The total cost for both Carlos and Benji is 90 + 90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time it takes for each leg of the trip and add them together.

The time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 days.

The time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car is half of 6 days, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The time it takes to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car is the same as the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car, which is 3 days.

The time it takes to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by bus is the same as the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, which is 6 days.

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (bus to Rochester) + 3 (car to Rochester) + 3 (car to New Jersey) + 6 (bus to New Jersey) = 18 days.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initial total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 32 (water) = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito is $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to calculate the number of pieces Kalinda can place per minute and her mom's rate.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute.

Total pieces = 360
Pieces per minute = 6

Time = Total pieces / Pieces per minute
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours.

Time in hours = 60 minutes / 60
Time in hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons harvested in the two instances and subtract that from the total number of melons.

Initially, 30% of 120 melons were ready for harvest, which is 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons. 

So, 36 melons were harvested in the first instance.

The remaining melons after the first harvest are 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 melons were ready for harvest, which is (3/4) * 84 = 63 melons.

So, 63 melons were harvested in the second instance.

The total number of melons harvested is 36 + 63 = 99 melons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 120 - 99 = 21 melons.

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2. 

25 * 2 = 50

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, and there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave, and then subtract that from the total number of penguins.

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins
Another one-third went inside the cave: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Total penguins that left: 12 + 12 = 24 penguins

Number of penguins left sunbathing: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 days in a week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 

6 tomatoes/day / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend's consumption)

Now, we multiply the girlfriend's consumption by 7 days in a week.

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend's consumption)

Total tomatoes consumed per week = Steve's consumption + girlfriend's consumption
= 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week
= 63 tomatoes/week

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed, we divide the total tomatoes consumed per week by the tomatoes produced per vine.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To find the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys.

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the first set of 25 pens.

However, the 5 new pens he made will also run out of ink eventually, and he can use the ink from these 5 pens to make more new pens. So, he can make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen from the ink of the 5 pens he made.

Now, he has a total of 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) + 1 (new pen) = 31 pens.

But, the 1 new pen he made from the 5 pens will also run out of ink, and he can use the ink from this 1 pen to make 1 / 5 = 0.2 new pens (since 1 pen is not a multiple of 5, we can't make a whole new pen, but we can make a fraction of a pen). However, since you can't have a fraction of a pen, we can round down to 0 new pens.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so his total amount is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. This sum of $30 tripled in a year, so we multiply $30 by 3 to find the final amount.

$30 * 3 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the given sequence of events.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.

30% of the students went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

The rest of the students went out through exit C:
280 students went out through exit C.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we add 6 to Robert's candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now that we know James has 33 candies and John has 54 candies, we can find out how many more candies John has than James.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33

"To find the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find the total number of letters Mike receives from his 3 remaining pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, the total number of letters is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds to each letter, he also writes 30 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time spent writing is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.
7. Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. 
Cost per day = 250 * 6 = $1500

She needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks. 
Total days = 4 * 5 = 20 days

Total cost before discount = 1500 * 20 = $30,000

After the movie is done, she gives a 10% discount. 
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * 30,000 = $3000

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school and then the total number of students. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 50% of the total number of students, which is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

Now, we know that the total number of students in the school is 60, and the total number of girls is 27. Therefore, the total number of boys in the school is 60 - 27 = 33.

Since each class has 20 students, and we know the number of girls in the first two classes (15 and 12), we can find the number of boys in the first two classes by subtracting the number of girls from 20. 

In the first class, the number of boys is 20 - 15 = 5. In the second class, the number of boys is 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, we know the number of boys in the first two classes (5 and 8), and the total number of boys in the school is 33. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 33 - (5 + 8) = 33 - 13 = 20.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today by multiplying 3 and x, which is 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today. The total number of wolves killed is 10 + 12 = 22. The total number of cougars killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 22 + 27 = 49.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight to find the remaining weight. 

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds. 

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000 to get the final weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has half as many bananas as apples, so Jamal has 44 / 2 = 22 bananas.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, but this is not possible since he has the same number of bananas as apples. This statement seems to be incorrect or misleading. However, we can proceed with the information we have.
5. Since Jamal has 22 bananas, and we are not given any information about Andrea's bananas, we will focus on the apples and bananas of Jamal.

We have 44 apples and 22 bananas for Jamal. 

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas Jamal has: 44 + 22 = 66.

Since we are not given any information about Andrea's bananas, we will only consider Jamal's fruits for the total count.

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, we find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. 

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of flour needed per dozen: 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour needed for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We repeat the same process: 30 / 12 = 2.5 (since 30 is not a perfect multiple of 12, we need to find the amount of flour for 2 dozens and 6 cookies). 

For 2 dozens (24 cookies), we need 2 * 2 = 4 cups of flour. For the remaining 6 cookies, we need 6 / 12 * 2 = 1 cup of flour. 

So, the total amount of flour needed for tomorrow is 4 + 1 = 5 cups.

Now, we add the flour needed for today and tomorrow: 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to calculate the total number of marbles she initially had and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison initially had 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. So, the total number of marbles she initially had is:
5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Then, she received 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the marbles she received to the initial number of marbles:
250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has: Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has: Harry has (2 * 3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

Now, to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to calculate the amount each girl has and then add them together.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $100 + $125 + $175 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price and her budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

1. Calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000
2. Calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000
3. Calculate the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
4. Subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000
5. Subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees and then add the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, let's find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

Now, let's find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: 51"

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we first need to find the total number of bedrooms and then multiply it by the number of windows in each bedroom. 

There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6. 

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of windows is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows, which is 12 + 8 = 20.

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, so the number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that had the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 
2/5 of 80 cards had the letter A, so (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards had the letter A.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 
1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48. So, (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards had the letter B.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C: 
5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24. So, (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards had the letter C.

Now, we add the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 
32 + 24 + 15 = 71 cards.

Finally, we subtract the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards to find the number of cards with the letter D: 
80 - 71 = 9 cards.

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10).

Simplifying the expression, we get: 
x + 10 + 20 - x + 10 
= 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, the mamba has half the number of spots as the cobra. So, the number of spots per mamba is 70 / 2 = 35.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

The total number of spots on both cobras and mambas is 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half the number of spots they all have combined is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length taken up by the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find the length taken up by the sterling silver beads, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads used, we divide the total length taken up by the beads by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.
The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.
The total number of stars in the flag is 76.
The number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.
Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star is 40 / 5 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the flagstones, we need to multiply the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones. 

Weight of one flagstone = 75 pounds
Number of flagstones = 80

Total weight of flagstones = 75 * 80 = 6000 pounds

Since each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of the truck to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of truck
= 6000 / 2000
= 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:

Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting."
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

4 adults are to get 6 chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are to be shared among the children. To find out how many chocolate bars are left, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and they are to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice by that amount.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members of the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 3 kg * 7 = 21 kg.

To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (21 kg):

42 kg / 21 kg/week = 2 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 5 working days instead of 7. To find out his target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the daily target and multiply it by 5.

Daily target = 120 / 7
Daily target = 17.14 (approximately)

Target for 5 working days = 17.14 * 5
Target for 5 working days = 85.7

Now, we can find out how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week.

Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 85.7 - 65
Crates off target = 20.7

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the exact difference, so we will keep the decimal.

The final answer is: 20.7"

The initial bid is $200. The bids rise by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, there are a total of 4 people who bid before Carmen makes her final bid. 

The bids will be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, and $450. 

Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, she will make 4 bids. The bids will be: $450, $500, $550, and $600. 

The last bid made by Carmen is $600. 

The total cost of the desk is $600."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 
   Since he goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded, it creates two identical halves. If we unfold it, we get two identical pages. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to have 32 pages in total. Since each piece of paper can be folded to create two identical pages, we need half the number of pages to be able to print all 32 pages.

32 / 2 = 16

Therefore, 16 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid."

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books left, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.20 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people."
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to first calculate how many loaves are left after the morning sales and then find out half of that amount.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. The total number of loaves is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning, so 60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight Joey loses per week by 4:

2 pounds per week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

However, the question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, not how much weight Sandy loses per week. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, the answer is 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract the amount he wants to save from his initial budget.

1. Calculate the cost of the business suits:
   6 suits * $100 = $600

2. Calculate the cost of the suitcases:
   3 suitcases * $50 = $150

3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
   The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is 5 * $100 = $500.
   The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

4. Calculate the total cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
   $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

5. Calculate how much Theo has left after buying these items:
   $6000 - $1950 = $4050

6. Calculate how much Theo has to save for the trip:
   $4050 - $2000 = $2050

"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first calculate the number of eggs consumed by each group per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to first find Jane's age. Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, the number of players on the offense as O, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so O = 2D.

We also know that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S, we get:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

2.5D = 105

Divide both sides by 2.5:

D = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
For the 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. 
1/4 of 8 is 2 people. 
So, 8 - 2 = 6 people couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments.

Now, subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited: 
24 - 6 = 18 people

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 98 * 2 = 196.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for volume is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. 

Let's start by finding the total number of people at the beginning of the party: 
Total people = men + women = 25 + 15 = 40

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can find the number of people who left by multiplying the total number of people by 1/4:
People who left = Total people * 1/4 = 40 * 1/4 = 10

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party, so the number of men who left is:
Men who left = Total men - Men who stayed = 25 - 22 = 3

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
Women who left = Total people who left - Men who left = 10 - 3 = 7

Now, we can find the number of women who stayed at the party:
Women who stayed = Total women - Women who left = 15 - 7 = 8

"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. 

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since Jam has 3 boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, we get the equation: 3x + 2 = 26.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 24.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: x = 8.

So, each box contains 8 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes * 8 pencils = 24 pencils, and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils they have is 26 (Jam) + 46 (Meg) = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box: 72 / 8 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required to achieve this. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). To cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35), we need to use ice cubes that cool the coffee by 13 degrees each. 

Number of ice cubes = (100 - 35) / 13 = 65 / 13 = 5

Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, so 5 ice cubes will weaken it by 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee further.

Total weakening effect = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. For every 2 old records, 1 new record is given. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Since 5 people are trading, we can set up an equation to find the total number of old records traded. Let x be the number of old records traded per person. The total number of old records traded is 5x. 

The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, so the total number of old records traded is twice the number of new records. Therefore, 5x = 2 * 7.

Solving for x, we get 5x = 14. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 14 / 5 = 2.8. 

However, since the number of old records must be a whole number, we can round down to 2.8, which is 2.8 * 5 = 14."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Next, let's find the salary of senior programmers:
Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Finally, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points the phone needs to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs to charge 100% - 60% = 40% more.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent on the current shopping trip: $43 - $12 = $31.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A: 
- Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B: 
- Gross income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is less than $24,000, Job A has a higher net pay rate.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay:
$24,000 - $32,400 = -$8,400

However, since we are looking for the difference in the job with the higher net pay rate, we need to subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay, but since the higher net pay is from Job A, we will subtract the net pay of Job B from the net pay of Job A.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

70 - 10 = 60

"Let's break down the information given:

- Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total.
- He has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since he has twice as many chickens as cows).

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

So, there are 20 cows.

Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, there are 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. 

The total number of legs from chickens is 40 * 2 = 80.
The total number of legs from cows is 20 * 4 = 80.

3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

For the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs
For the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are consumed by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies) - 27 (cookies consumed by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to first calculate the discount on each shirt and then subtract it from the original price of each shirt. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount is 40% of $30, which is 0.4 x $30 = $12. 
So, the discounted price of each shirt is $30 - $12 = $18. 
Since Davos bought 2 shirts, the total amount he paid is 2 x $18 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase, we need to first find the difference in daily earnings and then divide it by the original daily earnings, and finally multiply by 100.

Original daily earnings = 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
New daily earnings = 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Difference in daily earnings = New daily earnings - Original daily earnings = $1100 - $1000 = $100

Percentage increase = (Difference in daily earnings / Original daily earnings) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100
= 0.1 * 100

- Food: $25 per week * 4 weeks per month = $100 per month
- Treats: $20 per month (no change)
- Medicine: $100 per month (no change)

Total monthly expenses = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

Now, let's multiply the monthly expenses by 12 to find the yearly expenses:

$220 per month * 12 months per year = $2640 per year

1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

First, let's calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the school asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies, they need 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

$36 (initial amount) - $15 (amount spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours
Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 30% * Total time = 6 hours
To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal): Total time = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time: Time spent sightseeing = 40% * 20 hours = 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, so her earnings from the first job are:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, so her earnings from the second job are:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Her total earnings from both jobs are:
$200 + $75 = $275

She already has $80 in her savings, so the total amount she has is:
$275 (earnings) + $80 (savings) = $355

To find out how much money she still needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:
$400 (phone cost) - $355 (total amount she has) = $45

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the two shorter trees. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. 
The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars and teddy bears:

6 toy cars at $2 each = 6 x $2 = $12
5 teddy bears at $1 each = 5 x $1 = $5
Total spent = $12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially received $28 and his mother gave him an extra $10, so the total amount he had was:

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per person. Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf will be 5 + 5x. 

The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and Morgan and her friends will ride twice. So, the total cost for go-karts will be 2 * (10 + 10x).

The total budget is $90, so we can set up the equation: 5 + 5x + 5 + 20x = 90.

Combine like terms: 25x + 10 = 90.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 25x = 80.

Divide both sides by 25: x = 3.2.

Since you can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day and buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
4 lollipops * 25 cents = 4 * 0.25 = $1

Now, let's subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money:

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy had after buying the candy. 
   Initial amount of money = $10
   Cost of candy = $1.5 per pound
   Since we don't know the number of pounds of candy, let's call it 'x'. 
   Total cost of candy = $1.5x
   Change = Initial amount of money - Total cost of candy
   Change = $10 - $1.5x

2. Next, we know that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs. 
   Number of gumballs = 40
   Cost of each gumball = $0.05
   Total cost of gumballs = Number of gumballs * Cost of each gumball
   Total cost of gumballs = 40 * $0.05
   Total cost of gumballs = $2
   Since Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, the total cost of gumballs is half of his change.
   Half of change = Total cost of gumballs
   Half of change = $2
   Change = 2 * Half of change
   Change = 2 * $2
   Change = $4

3. Now we can find the total cost of the candy.
   Change = $10 - Total cost of candy
   $4 = $10 - $1.5x
   $1.5x = $10 - $4
   $1.5x = $6
   x = $6 / $1.5
   x = 4

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."

"To find the total distance John drove, we need to add the original distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home. 

Distance to friend's house = 200 miles
Detour = 10 miles
Distance back home = 240 miles
Total distance = 200 + 10 + 240 = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the time it took for each part of the trip and add them together.

Time to drive to friend's house = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (approximately)
Time for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.143 hours (approximately)

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold.

Total shoes sold = 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies for 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. 

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of 52, which is the total number of members. 

50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26.

Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

Now, we have 13 female members who can make it to the show. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. 

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 (female members) + 3 (teachers) = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests: 
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80. 

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is 6 x $2 = $12.

Now, we add the cost of erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

The cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is $36, and the cost for David to ride all 9 rides is $30. 

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she needs to wrap. 

Total gifts = gifts for family + gifts for friends + gifts for teachers
Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2
Total gifts = 12

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows. 

Now, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of bows (12) to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow.

Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Total bows
Ribbon per bow = 144 / 12
Ribbon per bow = 12

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5+6=11) and then multiply by the respective ratio parts.

Let's calculate the number of popsicles each person has:

Total popsicles = 165
Ratio sum = 5 + 6 = 11

Number of popsicles Betty has = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Number of popsicles Sam has = (6/11) * 165 = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we first need to determine the total number of books in the shelving system. Since there are 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to get the total number of spaces for books.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

However, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the system. To find the number of books she wants to place, we first need to double the number of spaces and then add 20.

Double the number of spaces = 36 * 2 = 72
Add 20 to the doubled number of spaces = 72 + 20 = 92

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each with 15 cards. So, the total number of cards her dad brought is 2 * 15 = 30.

Now, Erica has 20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so the total number of cards she passed out is 24 + 5 = 29.

Now, Erica has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

She received 17 cards from family and friends. So, the total number of cards Erica now has is 21 + 17 = 38.

"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

Since the pizza originally had 12 slices, the number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by his daily earnings.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 1/3rd of 90 = 90 / 3 = 30
Number of stink bugs: 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs:
90 + 30 + 48 = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine Alice's age. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as follows:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

Now, we can find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica:
Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12

"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings, then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find out how much he earns in a day: $50 per day.

Since he works 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, he works 6 * 4 = 24 days in a month.

There are 12 months in a year, so he works 24 * 12 = 288 days in a year.

Now, let's multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a year: $50 * 288 = $14,400.

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient.

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the reduced energy consumption.

Original energy consumption per day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

Reduced energy consumption per day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh

Energy saved per day: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required and then multiply it by their respective costs.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide 20 by 4:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of their individual costs:
$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. He bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
3. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.
4. Initially, he had twice as much corn as cannolis, so he had 2 * 40 = 80 corns.
5. Now, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.
6. The total number of corns and cannolis is 140 + 100 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before the jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can find the total steps he took during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

However, we need to subtract the steps he took before the jog from the total steps he took during the day to find the steps he took during the jog. So, 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

Therefore, Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading speed.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time taken to read the book = Total words / reading speed = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, Toby will be at the airport in 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so to find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the time he will arrive from the time he has to be there:

Time early = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees who remained after June and their total hours worked.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. So, 40 - 10 = 30 employees remained.

Each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks in May, which is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to the employees in May is 40 * 160 * $15 = $9600.

In June, the remaining 30 employees worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, which is 30 * 160 = 4800 hours. The total amount paid to the employees in June is 30 * 4800 * $15 = $216000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $9600 + $216000 = $225600.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, she gets 1 pound at the regular price of $3 and 1/2 pound at half off. The half pound is 0.5 pounds. The cost of the half pound is 0.5 * $3 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost of the fireworks by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%): $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent by Tim is the sum of the discounted cost of the fireworks and the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that number by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. To find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days, we multiply 2 cookies per night by 30 nights:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that explode. However, the problem doesn't directly give us the percentage of candles that explode. It only gives us the percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode, which is 99%. This means that 1% of the candles will explode. So, the number of candles that explode is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500.

However, the problem is that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the candles that are more dangerous, which also includes the 1% that explode. We can't simply multiply the two percentages together because the 5% is a subset of the 1%. 

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog out of the 1% that explode. Since 5% of the total candles smell like wet dog, and 1% of the total candles explode, the percentage of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is (5/100) / (1/100) = 5.

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 5% of the 500 candles that explode, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is the discounted price of each blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
Total cost = $14 * 4 = $56

"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: (45 + x) + 105 = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get 150 + x = 500.

Subtracting 150 from both sides, we get x = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the trip and add them together.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.
5. The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation: x = 28 - 6.
2. Solve for x: x = 22.
3. The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of this amount from the jogger jeans. So, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * 6 = 2.
4. The savings from the tattered jeans is the remaining 2/3 of the total savings, which is 2/3 * 6 = 4.
5. The cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the savings from the jogger jeans is $2. So, the original price of the jogger jeans is 22 + 2 = 24.
6. The original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. To find the difference, subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans: 24 - 28 = -4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

She bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 birds. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he must have sold enough cards to cover the remaining $50. 

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he keeps 1/3 of them, he sells 2/3 of them. The revenue from selling 2/3 of the cards is equal to $50. 

The revenue from selling 2/3 of the cards is 2/3 * x * $1.5. This is equal to $50. 

Now, we can set up the equation: (2/3) * x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get rid of the fraction: x * $1.5 = $50 * (3/2)

x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to solve for x: x = $75 / $1.5

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since he prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, he prepared for 36 / 2 = 18 guests to have two hotdogs. This means he prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 guests in total wanted hotdogs, and since 36 hotdogs were already prepared, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount, and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- Set of pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the discount amount:
Discount percentage: 20%
Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

3. Calculate the total cost after the discount:
Total cost before discount: $165.00
Discount amount: $33.00
Total cost after discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew, and then calculate one-fifth of that number.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 of 3 gallons is 3 * (1/4) = 0.75 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 0.75 gallons to pints. 

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. Since he had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money. 

Let's assume George had x dollars initially. Then, 99% of x is the amount he spent on chips and candy bars. We know that he spent $5, so we can set up the equation:

0.99x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George had $5.05 initially. 

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40. He bought 3 bags, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

Now, let's subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

5 - 1.20 = 3.80

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we can divide the total amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can round up to 5 candy bars because he had some money left over, which would be enough to buy one more candy bar.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we need to first find out how much the two pieces that Rory and her mom had weigh. 

Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and it was cut into 8 pieces, each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces. 

Rory and her mom each had a piece, so together they had 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces of cake. 

Now, to find the remaining weight of the cake, we subtract the weight of the two pieces from the total weight: 20 - 5 = 15 ounces.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then determine how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minutes before Wayne. However, since you can't leave a negative amount of time before someone, this means Bernadette needs to leave 1 minute after Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

However, the question asks how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, not how much later. Since Bernadette needs to leave 1 minute after Wayne, she should leave 1 minute earlier than Wayne.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven:

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window:

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it cools down:
(30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to oven = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease due to window = 6 degrees
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
= 40 + 15 - 6
= 49 degrees

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete the swim and bike ride. 

The time it took Jon to complete the swim is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so we need to find 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 x 40 = 4 minutes. 

So, James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

The time it took Jon to complete the bike ride is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 10 minutes more than the total time it took Jon. 

The total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

So, the total time it took James to complete the triathlon is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We already know that James took 36 minutes to complete the swim and 85 minutes to complete the bike ride. To find out how long it took him to complete the run, we need to subtract the time it took him to complete the swim and bike ride from the total time.

The time it took James to complete the run is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the dozen cases and add the loose eggs. 

1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs. Since Rozanne has 4 dozen cases, she has 4 x 12 = 48 eggs from the cases. Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue from the sale of the sneakers is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

Since the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket alone is $20 - $1 = $19. 

Now, let's consider the cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a soda for $3. The total cost is $12 + $3 = $15.

Since the total cost without the super ticket is $18, and the cost of the movie ticket alone is $19, the cost of the popcorn is $18 - $15 = $3.

The regular price of popcorn is $3."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find x, we divide both sides by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon is $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Cost of filling 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 65 * 170
Cost of filling 170 balloons = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 150 miles / 3 hours
= 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

The value of the 2 rubies she received is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

The total value of the 3 sapphires she traded is subtracted from the total value of the sapphires she started with, and then the value of the 2 rubies is added to the remaining sapphires:
$6400 - $2400 + $2400 = $4400

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $4400."
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length x width x height = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 x $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of red cards = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we need to find the percentage of puppies with spots out of the total number of puppies. 
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

Number of trips = Total weight of feed / Truck's capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. In a month (4 weeks), she drinks 3 * 4 = 12 aluminum cans. Since each aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her earnings from aluminum cans in a month are 12 * 2 = 24 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. In a month (4 weeks), she drinks 5 * 4 = 20 plastic bottles. Since each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her earnings from plastic bottles in a month are 20 * 3 = 60 cents.

Now, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find her total earnings in a month: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples: 20 * 0.45 = $9. 
Then, we subtract the discount: $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples: 20 * 0.50 = $10. 
Then, we calculate the discount: 10% of $10 is 0.1 * $10 = $1. 
Finally, we subtract the discount: $10 - $1 = $9.

Now, we compare the costs: Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8. 
The difference is $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So, the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs is 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Therefore, the total number of shoes he has on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the number of carrot sticks Matt eats be 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as (x/2) + 2. 

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation (x/2) + 2 = 5 to represent this situation.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Combined length of remoras = 1 foot
Length of shark = 10 feet

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

"To find the total number of students, we need to first find the number of students who have a desktop computer and then add the number of students who do not have a desktop computer.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. 

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. 

The number of students who do not have a desktop computer is one-fourth of 'x', which is x/4. We are given that this number is 20.

So, we can set up the equation: x/4 = 20

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to find out how many days he has to walk in total in 3 weeks. 

21 days / 3 weeks = 7 days (he can walk 4 days a week, so this is not needed)

Now, we need to find out how many minutes Jason has to walk each day to break in the shoes in 21 days. 

Total minutes = 240 minutes
Total days = 21 days
Minutes per day = Total minutes / Total days
Minutes per day = 240 minutes / 21 days
Minutes per day = 11.42857 minutes (round to 2 decimal places)

However, since Jason can only walk 4 days a week, we need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day to break in the shoes in 3 weeks. 

Total minutes = 240 minutes
Total days = 3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days
Minutes per day = Total minutes / Total days
Minutes per day = 240 minutes / 12 days
Minutes per day = 20 minutes

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

Total hours = Total miles / Speed
Total hours = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours = 6 hours/week

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon, and then divide by the total number of razors.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The cost after the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack after the sale, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the total number of razors. 2 packs of razors contain 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors. The total cost is $2.00, which is equivalent to 200 cents. The total number of razors is 8.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by each of them is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into the new equation: 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B/2 = 36.

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2B + B = 72.

Combine like terms: 3B = 72.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 24.

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12 (since each pair consists of 2 snowshoes).

The cost of each pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost of snowshoes for all of Mario's dogs is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of 10 bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to first determine the total number of items Rose bought. Since Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, the total number of items she bought is 12 + 4 = 16.

We are told that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Let's represent the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. Then, the number of items Rose bought is 4x. Since we know Rose bought 16 items, we can set up the equation:

4x = 16

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 16 / 4
x = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 items. Since the problem doesn't specify whether the items are onions or potatoes, we can assume that Sophia bought 4 of one type of item."
"To find the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to subtract his birthday from the current date. 

December 31st to July 19th is approximately 6 months and 19 days. 

There are 30 days in a month, so 6 months is 6 * 30 = 180 days. 

Adding the remaining 19 days, Andy has 180 + 19 = 199 days to lose the weight.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories in total.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 199 ≈ 527 calories.

The final answer is: 527"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald works 7 days a week, and he earns $30 per day. 

Total earnings for the week = 7 days * $30/day = $210

Gerald spent $100.

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, Julie has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, Julie has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can multiply x by 3:

3x = 3 * 30,000
3x = 90,000

The house cost $90,000."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. 

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the profit per bag, then the profit per bag is ($8 - $4) = $4 per bag. The total profit would be 8 bags * $4 per bag = $32.

If we assume that the problem is asking for the profit, then the answer is $32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he threw punches and then multiply it by the average number of punches per minute.

The fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total number of minutes is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375 punches.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2. Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
   3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

"To find out how long Royce takes, we first need to determine how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes.

Since Royce takes double the time it takes Rob plus 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: Royce's time = (2 * Rob's time) + 40 minutes. 

Substituting Rob's time (120 minutes) into the equation, we get: Royce's time = (2 * 120) + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

The total number of problems is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Monday and Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the number of problems remaining after Wednesday is 52 - 13 = 39.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, let's subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (total loaves baked) - 132 (loaves sold) - 6 (loaves returned) = 62

The bakery had 62 loaves of bread left.

"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

Total number of rows = 6 + 3 = 9

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will have 1/3 of the raisins for each. 

1/3 of 27 cups of raisins is 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide 9 cups by 3/4 to find out how many batches she can make.

To divide 9 by 3/4, we multiply 9 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3.

9 * (4/3) = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 

Weekly consumption before adding the new device = 12 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatts/hour
Cost before adding the new device = 84 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $126

After adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Weekly consumption after adding the new device = 14 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts/hour
Cost after adding the new device = 98 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill = Cost after adding the new device - Cost before adding the new device
= $147 - $126

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days would be 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Since one person would take 240 hours to paint a whole house, we need to divide this time by the number of people to find out how long it would take 5 people to paint the house. 

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Let's call the number of chairs Ophelia has 'x'. Then, the number of sofas she has is x - 2. We know that the number of sofas Ophelia has is 20, so we can set up the equation x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22. This means Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. Total = 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 152.

The final answer is: 152"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Let's first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. 

Total amount spent = $48
Amount spent on CD = $4
Amount spent on headphone set = Total amount spent - Amount spent on CD
Amount spent on headphone set = $48 - $4
Amount spent on headphone set = $44

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Number of CDs bought with headphone set money = Amount spent on headphone set / Price of one CD
Number of CDs bought with headphone set money = $44 / $4
Number of CDs bought with headphone set money = 11

Since Tom bought 1 CD, the number of CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set is 11 - 1 = 10.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours. Since there are 8 weeks, and he worked out 4 hours in 6 of those weeks, the total hours spent in those weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 5 hours. He worked out 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, so the total hours spent in those weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Finally, let's find the total hours spent in the week where he worked out 6 hours. He worked out 6 hours in 1 week, so the total hours spent in that week is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in.
Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 passengers get in.
Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J and his cousin's age in 8 years as C. 
   We know that C = 2J - 5.
3. Since Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old in 8 years, J = 30.
4. Now we can find C by substituting J into the equation: C = 2(30) - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.
5. Now we know Jame's age in 8 years (30) and his cousin's age in 8 years (55), so we can find the current age of his cousin by subtracting 8 from both ages: 
   Jame's current age: 30 - 8 = 22
   Cousin's current age: 55 - 8 = 47
6. The difference in their ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

The computer cost $1,100, and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. So, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since Errol bought the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400, the total cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) seashells.

First, we calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 600 = 2400.

Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this amount: 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought: 3000 / 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total savings for the first half of the month. 

Since Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125 and he wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, let's assume the savings for the first half is x. 

The total savings for the first half is x, and the total savings for the second half is 2x. 

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings for the first and second half, which is x + 2x = 3x. 

Since the total savings for the month is $1125, we can set up the equation: 3x = 1125.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 1125 / 3 = 375.

Now that we know the savings for the first half is $375, we can find the savings for the second half, which is 2x = 2 * 375 = 750.

Since there are 15 days in the second half of April, we can find the daily savings for the second half by dividing the total savings for the second half by 15: 750 / 15 = 50.

In this case, a = 3, r = 3, and n = 4.

an = 3 * 3^(4-1)
an = 3 * 3^3
an = 3 * 27
an = 81

So, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in the larger play set as follows:

Total toys in larger play set = 5 * 80 = 400

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, x + 2 = 400.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

Cost of 5 notebooks: 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
Cost of 2 pens: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
Cost of 1 calculator: $12
Cost of 1 geometry set: $10
Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost.
10% of $30 = 0.10 x $30 = $3
Discount amount: $3
Total cost after discount: $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost of the items is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly gives a $50 bill, so the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to calculate the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000.

Commission for the first $1000: 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Commission for the sales over $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
Additional commission: 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission: $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill needs in total, we first need to calculate the number of bottles he already has. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles for each of the 70 guests, he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles in total.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a hot day, we need to first calculate the time it takes him to swim a mile on a warm day. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we know that Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold and 34 minutes when the water is warm. To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day, we multiply the time it takes him to swim a mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles on a warm day, we multiply the time it takes him to swim a mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a warm day to find the difference: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we can divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3. 

Cost of the foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: 3 * $40 = $120

Now, we need to find the total cost of both subs. 

Total cost = Cost of the foot-long fish sub + Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

There are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker, which is half the size of Timothy's locker. 

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. 
Zack's locker is half of Timothy's locker: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. 
Peter's locker is 1/4 of Zack's locker: 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake, we first need to determine how many cups he currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this amount, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Since Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups, we subtract 4 from 20 to find the reduction: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 + 15 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180

"To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) to the angle the sun moves (5 degrees per hour) multiplied by the number of hours it moves (10 hours).

Initial angle of the pyramid = 32 degrees
Angle the sun moves per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours the sun moves = 10 hours

Final angle = Initial angle + (Angle the sun moves per hour * Number of hours)
Final angle = 32 + (5 * 10)
Final angle = 32 + 50
Final angle = 82 degrees

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total amount James spends: 4 * 3 = 12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read a total of 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so the total for these teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for these teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored, we need to determine their individual goal counts. 

Since Richie scored 80 goals and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can set up an equation to find Mark's goal count: 
Richie's goals - 20 = Mark's goals
80 - 20 = 60
Mark scored 60 goals.

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can set up an equation to find Anna's goal count:
Richie's goals - 45 = Anna's goals
80 - 45 = 35
Anna scored 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their individual goal counts:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply 21 by 4 to find out how much he made: 21 * 4 = 84.

Now, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and add them up.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he has $70, he can spend a maximum of $35 on wooden action figures (70 / 2 = 35, since he will spend an equal amount each day for one week). 

Number of wooden action figures = 35 / 5 = 7

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $35 left, and he will spend an equal amount each day for 4 days. 

Number of plastic action figures = 35 / 4 = 8.75 (round down to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of an action figure)

Total number of action figures = 7 (wooden) + 8 (plastic) = 15

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses per week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Total cost for bread per 10 sandwiches: $3.00 per loaf * 1 loaf (since 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches) = $3.00
Total cost for cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches: $30.00
Total cost per 10 sandwiches: $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Total revenue per 10 sandwiches: $7.00 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $70.00

Since the question asks for the net profit, we need to find the profit per 10 sandwiches. 
Profit per 10 sandwiches: Total revenue per 10 sandwiches - Total cost per 10 sandwiches = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

To find the profit per sandwich, we divide the profit per 10 sandwiches by 10:
Profit per sandwich: $37.00 / 10 = $3.70

However, the question asks for the net profit, which is the profit per 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the net profit is $37.00."
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

Since Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons.

She melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon. To find out how many muffin crayons she can make, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffins

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and add it to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

So, the temperature Maggie should set it at is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we first need to determine how many cups and dishes she brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of dishes she brought is 24. The total number of cups her friend brought is 40, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44.

To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we add the number of cups and dishes she brought: 12 + 24 = 36.

To find the total number of utensils brought by her friend, we add the number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first find the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have, and then the total cost of the contacts.

Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he will have per day by dividing 90 by 45. 

90 / 45 = 2 pairs of contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have 2 * 90 = 180 single use contacts. 

To find the total number of pairs of contacts, we divide 180 by 2. 

180 / 2 = 90 pairs of contacts

Since each box is $100 and there is a 10% discount, we need to find the discount amount first. 

10% of $100 = 0.1 * $100 = $10

The discounted price of each box is $100 - $10 = $90

The total cost of 2 boxes is 2 * $90 = $180

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs of contacts.

$180 / 90 = $2

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To solve this problem, let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x. 

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99x = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

x = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99x = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01x = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
He increases his speed by 5 WPM again, so the third measurement is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we can find the average of the three measurements: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight change for the first option from the weight change for the second option.

For the first option (eating Cheerios), Martin loses 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

For the second option (eating donuts), Martin gains 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is the weight gain for the second option minus the weight loss for the first option: 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: 2.5"
"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given:

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex then calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 couples will be attending, which is 8 * 2 = 16 people.

3. To find the total number of people attending, we add the people invited via email (300) and the people invited by phone (16). However, we need to subtract Alex herself because she is already included in the count. 

Total number of people = 300 + 16 - 1 = 315.

Therefore, Alex will need 315 seats."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet. 

Since the beanstalk doubles in height every day and starts at 4 feet, we can calculate its height for each day as follows:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of one implant is $2000, and the base price of two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the two implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he gets each year and add them up.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 24 = 34 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 48 = 58 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 34 + 58 = 114 games.

The final answer is: 114"
"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

The additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours."
"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we first need to find out how much each of them makes in 12 hours.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2:
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we first find out how much he makes in 1 hour (which we already know is 60 pounds), and then multiply it by 2 to find out how much he makes in 2 hours:
60 * 2 = 120 pounds in 2 hours.

Now, we multiply 120 pounds by 3/4 to find out how much Marissa makes in 1 hour:
120 * 3/4 = 90 pounds per hour.

Now that we know how much each of them makes in 1 hour, we can find out how much they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa: 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

Now, we add the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together:
720 + 1080 = 1800

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total revenue from each period, then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total revenue from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total revenue from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Total revenue from selling lemonade for 6 hours = Total revenue from the first four hours + Total revenue from the next two hours
Total revenue = $30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the total rotations per year.

Rotations per year = 290,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 3,480,000 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years the tire will last.

Years before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 3,480,000 rotations/year = 3 years

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find the total number of pounds of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants he wants to make is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them:
Profit = Selling Price - Cost to Acquire
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profit:
Commission = Profit * 0.1
Commission = $175,000 * 0.1
Commission = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them and then divide the distance between them by this relative speed.

The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

The distance between them is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends is $60. Since each class costs $10, the total cost of the classes he attends is 10 * (10 - x) = 100 - 10x.

Since the total cost of all classes is $60, we can set up the equation:

100 - 10x = 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides gives:

-10x = -40

Dividing both sides by -10 gives:

x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine how many customers each person processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 (Jewel) + 700 (Julie) = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. We know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. 

So, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This means that Reggie's distance minus 3 miles is equal to Lynn's distance. 

So, Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 - 3
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = 0.5 * $20,000 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and a 10% discount was offered on the total cost. So, the total cost is:
20 * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats can be represented as 0.5G. Since we know the sales from red hats are $400, we can set up the equation:

0.5G = 400

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

2. The total sales in the first month are the sum of sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800 = $1200

3. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's calculate the sales in the second month:

Sales in the second month = (3/4) * Total sales in the first month
= (3/4) * 1200
= 900

4. To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of both months:

Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= $2100

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

"To find out how much candy each person would have after sharing equally, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount of candy by the number of people. 

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
= 12 / 3
= 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of type A candies and type B candies separately and then add them together.

Cost of type A candies: 7 candies * $0.5 = $3.5
Cost of type B candies: 10 candies * $0.75 = $7.5
Total cost of candies: $3.5 + $7.5 = $11

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to subtract the good days already recorded from the total number of good days. 

Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, which means 2 of these days were good. 

So, the total number of good days in the first 33 days is 12 + 2 = 14. 

The total number of good days left in the month is 14 - 12 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to first determine what ""twice the number of books that Sally has"" means. Let's call the number of books Sally has ""x"". 

Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, we can write an equation: 

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation as follows:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So Sally has 9 books. 

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. Now, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. So, he needs 16 more toys. Now, he has 12 (previous toys) + 16 (additional toys) = 28 toys for 28 dogs.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Now, he has 28 - 3 = 25 toys for 25 dogs.

However, the question asks for the total number of toys James needs, not the number of toys he has. Since James needs 1 toy per dog, and there are 25 dogs, he needs 25 toys.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances' investments.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances' investment is 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

Skyler's investment is the remaining amount, which is $240.

"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 1 potato / 6 hash browns

Now, we can use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:

96 potatoes / 6 hash browns per potato = 96 / 6
96 / 6 = 16

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 16 hash browns.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = 80 kg/adult * 9 adults = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has and add them together.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies.

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to first subtract the 20cm added to the bottom of the dress. 

Final length = Original length + 50% of original length + 20cm
140cm = Original length + 0.5 * Original length + 20cm

Combine like terms:
140cm = 1.5 * Original length + 20cm

Subtract 20cm from both sides:
120cm = 1.5 * Original length

Divide both sides by 1.5:
Original length = 120cm / 1.5
Original length = 80cm

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. 
Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t. We are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can write the equation:

2T + t = 44

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation:

T = t + 7

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for t:

2(t + 7) + t = 44

Expanding the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + t = 44

Combine like terms:

3t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3t = 30

Divide both sides by 3:

t = 10

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin by substituting t into the second equation:

T = t + 7
T = 10 + 7
T = 17

The final answer is: 17"

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

The total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

The total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, so the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.
The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square (1 foot by 1 foot).

The comforter has 14 red squares. 
The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
The comforter has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
The comforter has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 * 1 * 1 = 68 square feet.

"To find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has, we need to multiply the number of high chairs by 5. 

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Since babies also need chairs, we need to add the number of babies to the number of adults. 

Number of chairs the restaurant already has = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she already has from the total number of chairs needed.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production rate per hour for both types of ice cream:

50 quarts per hour (chocolate) + 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts per hour

To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply the total production rate per hour by 48:

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference between Amy's and Ginger's remaining candy is 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total area that Mr. Boarden needs to cover, we need to calculate two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. 

Two-thirds of 36 sq ft is calculated as: (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the total area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot: 24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

The difference in cost is $75 (store price) - $65 (picking price) = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends, we first need to find out how many slices they ate in total. Since there are 5 people in this group (Bryce and 4 friends), and each ate 2/3 of their pizza, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by this group.

First, we find the total number of slices each person ate: 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices. 

Since there are 5 people in this group, the total number of slices they ate is: 8 * 5 = 40 slices.

Next, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. Each of them ate 3/4 of their pizza, so we can calculate the total number of slices they ate.

First, we find the total number of slices each person ate: 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices.

Since there are 2 people in this group, the total number of slices they ate is: 9 * 2 = 18 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by both groups: 40 + 18 = 58 slices.

Since there were originally 5 pizzas with 12 slices each, the total number of slices was: 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 58 = 2 slices.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to this gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write this as an equation:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he will chew (120) by the number of pieces in a pack (15).

120 / 15 = 8

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the total number of smores needed, we need to calculate the total number of smores for kids and adults separately and then add them together.

Kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
Adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required.

24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves required by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed.

3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers."
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has, and then compare Clara's and Alice's book counts.

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

2 * Steven's books = 20

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides by 2:

Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can find Alice's book count by adding 6 to Steven's book count:

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can compare Clara's and Alice's book counts to find out how many more books Clara has:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls, so the number of girls in each class is 0.4x. Since there are two classes, the total number of girls is 2(0.4x) = 0.8x.

We know that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class. Now, we can find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. The number of boys in each class is 0.6x = 0.6(40) = 24.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 60 small buttons.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons

Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, and this is equal to the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, which is 2 * 11 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of shirts for each size and add them together.

- Small: 2 * 11 = 22 students
- Medium: 22 + 4 = 26 students
- Large: 26 / 2 = 13 students
- Extra-large: 13 + 6 = 19 students

Now, let's add the number of shirts for each size together: 
11 + 22 + 26 + 13 + 19 = 91

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 5% of the original price. 

5% of $140 = 0.05 x $140 = $7

"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to calculate the total number of songs and then multiply it by the length of each song.

Total number of songs = 300 songs per playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Since each song is 10 hours long, the total number of hours the playlists will last is:
Total hours = 6000 songs * 10 hours per song = 60000 hours

The final answer is: 60000"
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we first need to determine the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving the allowance from his sister.

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x.
2. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.
3. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.
4. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.
5. To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.
6. Combine like terms: 5x = 500.
7. Divide both sides by 5 to solve for x: x = 100.
8. Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 x $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 x $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, let's add their costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, we find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, we add the result to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (additional pears) = 290

Since George has both bananas and pears, we need to add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:
290 (bananas and pears) + 200 (bananas) = 490

The total number of fruits George has is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial amount) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining amount) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to calculate the total amount of oranges required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms would cost 20 * $3 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so Ezra will read 300 + 150 = 450 books in total.

Now, we need to find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read. 

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: her hourly wage and her daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her hourly wage is $15, so she earns 5 hours * $15/hour = $75 for the hours worked. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns a daily bonus of $5. 

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her hourly wage is $15, so she earns 2 hours * $15/hour = $30 for the hours worked. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn a daily bonus.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for the two days. On Monday, she earns $75 (hourly wage) + $5 (daily bonus) = $80. On Wednesday, she earns $30 (hourly wage) + $0 (daily bonus) = $30. 

Total earnings = $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total number of vanilla scents sold - Total number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we need to first calculate the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = (1/3) * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils and gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. 
   1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.
   So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

2. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   3/5 of 25 is 25 * (3/5) = 15 pencils given to Charlie.
   So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

Time to drive to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours

Time to drive back home:
Since the distance is the same, the time will also be the same: 2 hours

Total time driving = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time driving + Time spent at the museum = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels needed for both the cars and the motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, the number of wheels that will be left after assembling all the toys is 650 - 374 = 276.

"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, you need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 x $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so:

Number of movies in series = 600 / 3 = 200

Since Mike can buy these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:

Cost of movies in series = 200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:

Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200 = 400
Number of older movies = 400 * 0.4 = 160

The cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series or older movies:

Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200 - 160 = 240

The cost of the remaining movies is:

Cost of remaining movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance driven. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance driven is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, let's add the distance driven and the distance hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - (x + 4)) because the total time for the level is 60 seconds.

The score for Emma is x + (number of enemies Emma jumps on) + (number of berries Emma collects) + (time left on the timer for Emma).
The score for Ava is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (60 - (x + 4)).

Simplifying Ava's score: (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (60 - (x + 4)) = x + 8 + x + 3 + 60 - x - 4 = 2x + 7.

The score for Emma is x + (number of enemies Emma jumps on) + (number of berries Emma collects) + (time left on the timer for Emma).
Since we don't know the number of enemies Emma jumps on or the time left on the timer for Emma, we can represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on as x - 8 and the time left on the timer for Emma as (x - 4).

The score for Emma is x + (x - 8) + 3 + (x - 4) = x + x - 8 + 3 + x - 4 = 3x - 9.

The difference between their scores is (2x + 7) - (3x - 9) = 2x + 7 - 3x + 9 = -x + 16.

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact difference. However, we can express the difference in terms of x.

But, if we consider the problem statement, we can assume that the number of enemies Emma jumps on and the time left on the timer for Emma are both positive. So, x - 8 > 0 and x - 4 > 0. This means x > 8 and x > 4. The minimum value of x is 9.

If x = 9, the difference between their scores is -9 + 16 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

The two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

64 (total cost) - 60 (cost of two pizzas) = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. There are 2 extra days, so the total number of times they ride on extra days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17, and this includes both white and orange fish. Since Bob bought all the fish from the tank, the total number of fish he bought is 17.

The total number of fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (bought fish) = 24.

We know that the number of orange fish in the pond is 3 (initial) + 2x (bought), and the number of white fish is 4 (initial) + x (bought).

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 17/3.

However, since x represents the number of white fish Bob bought, it must be a whole number. The problem statement implies that the number of fish bought is a whole number, so we need to re-examine the equation.

Let's re-examine the equation: 3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

Since 3x is not a whole number, we made an error in our previous assumption. Let's re-examine the problem statement again.

We know that the total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 24, and the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x.

The total number of fish in the pond is 24, so the number of white fish is 4 (initial) + x (bought), and the number of orange fish is 3 (initial) + 2x (bought).

We can set up the equation: 4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

We know that the total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 24, and the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x.

The total number of fish in the pond is 24, so the number of white fish is 4 (initial) + x (bought), and the number of orange fish is 3 (initial) + 2x (bought).

We can set up the equation: 4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and the total gallons of gas consumed per week.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week:
- Distance between home and office: 5 miles (one way)
- Since Andy drives to and from work, the total distance per day is: 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles
- Total miles driven per week: 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week

Next, let's calculate the total gallons of gas consumed per week:
- Fuel efficiency: 10 MPG
- Total miles driven per week: 50 miles
- Total gallons of gas consumed per week: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Now, let's calculate the total money spent on gas per week:
- Price of gas: $3/gallon
- Total gallons of gas consumed per week: 5 gallons
- Total money spent on gas per week: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15/week

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 0.25. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 0.125.

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 1 (which represents 100% of the total TVs sold). 
1 - 0.375 = 0.625.

To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we multiply the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (0.625).
0.625 * 40 = 25

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the number of groups formed and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

The total number of people is 90, and they are split into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups:

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought back:

6 * 2 = 12

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230

Number of stuffed koalas = 5
Number of stuffed zebras = 2
Number of stuffed frogs = 4

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy, so we will round down to the nearest whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal.

Number of stuffed goats to buy = 4

However, since 4.2 is 4.2% of 14, and 4 is 28.6% of 14, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that will make 30% of 14. 

Let's find the difference between 28.6% and 30% of 14.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch, and each bag has 72 chips, we need to find out how many square inches Milo can make with two bags of chips. 

First, we multiply the number of chips in one bag by 2 to find the total number of chips: 72 * 2 = 144 chips.

Next, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches with the glass chips, we need to find out how long the mosaic can be. 

To do this, we divide the total square inches by the height of the mosaic: 12 / 3 = 4.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea drank by the 4 students and the 16 students separately and then add them together.

4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea drank by the 4 students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea drank by the 16 students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea drank from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 38 / 4 = 9.5 gallons.

However, the question asks for the amount of tea at the beginning of the party. We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left, and we calculated that 38 quarts were drank. To find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the amount of tea drank to the amount of tea left: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The two friends who are worse than Jack can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The number of quarters they use is 240 / 10 = 24 each.

The friend who is better than Jack can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes. The number of quarters he uses is 240 / 30 = 8.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 24 (worse friend 1) + 24 (worse friend 2) + 8 (better friend) = 68.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * 0.25 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S, and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = S.

We know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute Z for F in the equation S = 2Z, so S = 2F.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2F. We can substitute S = 2F into the equation O = 2S, so O = 2(2F) = 4F.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F for Z, so O = 4F = 4Z.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it is made up of Z + F + S + S + O. Since F = Z and S = S = 2Z, we can substitute these values into the equation, so the total amount is Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms to get 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10 to get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find F = Z = 1, S = 2Z = 2, and O = 4Z = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed: 63
Cupcakes already have: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of cars Joe sold or gave away: 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars he sold or gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Now, we need to divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

$125,000 (from students) ÷ 20 students = $6,250 per student

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means 1/2 of 70 cars had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

The total points scored by Sasha in both games is 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has by substituting x = 47 into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Weight-based cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
- Mileage-based cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
- Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
- Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total shipping cost: $2.99
- Refund amount: $24
- Loss: $2.99 + (purchase price - refund amount) = $2.99 + ($32 - $24) = $2.99 + $8 = $10.99

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok per week:

- Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
- Total time per week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time per week by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. However, the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. So, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is:

- Mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the sum of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now that we know Anthony's savings, we can calculate Roy's savings. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we can calculate Roy's savings as follows:

Let's first find 40% of Anthony's savings:
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:
Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the lifting capacity of each person relative to Pompei's lifting capacity.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time it takes for one kangaroo.

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time for one kangaroo = 6 hours

Next, we need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since we know the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. However, we don't know the distance. But we can use the fact that the speed of the turtles is half the speed of the kangaroo. Let's denote the speed of the kangaroo as K and the speed of the turtle as T. We know that T = 0.5K.

Now, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance. 

Time for four turtles = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for four turtles = 2 * 6 hours
Time for four turtles = 12 hours

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution: 
$150 (payment) + $80 (mom's contribution) = $230

Since the price of the new laptop is reduced by $200 when she trades in her old laptop, the new price of the laptop is:
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so we can set up the equation:
$230 (total money) + $50 (extra money needed) = $400 (new price of the laptop)

Now, let's solve for the extra money needed:
$230 + $50 = $280

Since Erika already has $230, we can subtract this from the total amount she needs to find out how much money she had initially:
$280 (total needed) - $230 (already has) = $50 (initially had) 

However, this is the amount she needed to buy the laptop after trading in her old one. To find out how much she had in her purse initially, we need to add the $200 she got from trading in her old laptop:
$50 (initially had) + $200 (traded in) = $250

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. 

Total milk produced = 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day

Since the farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to produce the remaining amount of milk.

Remaining milk needed = 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk.

Number of cows needed = 10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

The farmer already has 3 cows, so we need to add the number of cows needed to the number of cows he already has.

Total cows needed = 3 cows + 2 cows = 5 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2:
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions of the glue sticks together:
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's denote your age as 'x'. Since you are three years younger than your brother, your brother's age is 'x + 3'. Your sister is 2 years younger than you, so her age is 'x - 2'. 

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine the 'x' terms and the constants: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can infer that the problem is asking for a whole number age, but the ages of the family members are not necessarily whole numbers. We can assume that the ages are whole numbers, and the problem is asking for the age of the person who is three years younger than the brother. 

However, to solve for the age of the person who is three years younger than the brother, we need to find the age of the brother first. The brother's age is x + 3. 

We can use the equation 8x = 78 to find the value of x. However, we need to find the value of x that makes all the ages whole numbers.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed:
54 ÷ 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on the first day, the second day, and the third day, and then add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"This problem can be modeled using exponential growth. The initial number of infected people is 10, and each day, the number of infected people increases by a factor of 7 (6 new infections per person plus the original person).

Day 1: 10 * 7 = 70
Day 2: 70 * 7 = 490
Day 3: 490 * 7 = 3430

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. 
Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), Claire will earn 1 * 12 = 12 badges.
Amber will earn 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.
Wendy will earn 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices she baked per hour is 2 * 8 = 16 slices.

In 5 hours, she baked 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, the total amount she raised is 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins she has. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 

The equation would be: x + (x + 30) = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 70

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Gretchen has 20 silver coins. 

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold coins) + 20 (silver coins) = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students and Mr. George. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos given to the students and eaten by Mr. George is 500 + 20 = 520.

Since George ordered 600 burritos, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

1. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.
2. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.
3. The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.
4. Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms:
2A + 25 + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the third equation into the above equation to get:
2(F - 12) + 25 + F = 85
Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + 25 + F = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(26 * 7) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces eaten, we add the pieces eaten on each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, then adding the results together.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bolts:
16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate. 

Her hourly rate can be calculated by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3). 

Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the total number of hours she will work (12) to find out her total earnings.

Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gives him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. He loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 80 / 4 = 20. So, he loses 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total he had after receiving the marbles from his friend: 80 - 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scored from each type of question and add them together.

Multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 multiple-choice questions. 
80% of 10 = 0.8 * 10 = 8
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

True/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 true/false questions. 
90% of 20 = 0.9 * 20 = 18
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she scores 18 points from true/false questions.

Long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 long-answer questions. 
60% of 5 = 0.6 * 5 = 3
Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5
= 900 / 5
= 180

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Since he needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each, we can calculate the total revenue he needs to generate:

Total revenue = Number of chickens * Price per chicken
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Now, to find out how much he bought the chickens for, we subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / Number of people selling glasses
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 32 / 2
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. To do this, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
Difference = 14 - 16
Difference = -2

"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

1. The cost of the hair service is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we add the costs of all three services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will receive from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope:

Length of the rope: 20 meters
Price per meter: $2
Total amount of money = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * $2
Total amount of money = $40

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope: unknown (but we can calculate it later)
Price per meter: $1.5
Let's assume the length of the new rope is x meters. Then, the cost of the new rope is:
Cost of the new rope = x * $1.5

Since Sarah plans to use the profit to buy the new rope, the profit will be equal to the cost of the new rope. We can set up an equation:

Profit = Cost of the new rope
$40 - Cost of the original rope = x * $1.5
$40 - $20 = x * $1.5
$20 = x * $1.5
x = $20 / $1.5
x = 13.33 meters (round down to 13 meters, since you can't buy a fraction of a meter of rope)

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:
Cost of the new rope = 13 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $19.5

Finally, let's calculate how much money Sarah will have left over:
Money left over = Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = $40 - $19.5
Money left over = $20.5

The final answer is: $20.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Let's assume Melanie's current age is 'x'. In 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, her current age 'x' plus 10 years will be equal to 18. 

x + 10 = 18

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. 

Let's assume the number of years after which her age will be thrice her present age is 'y'. 

In 'y' years, her age will be 8 + y. 

Her age will be thrice her present age, so we can write the equation as: 
8 + y = 3 * 8

Now, we need to solve for 'y'. 

8 + y = 24

y = 24 - 8
y = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert has a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x. 

The total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the runtime of the main concert and the encore, which is 2x + 15. We are given that this total runtime is 65 minutes.

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The runtime of her usual concerts is 25 minutes."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is 3x + x + 5x = 9x. 

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and since she mowed his lawn 'x' times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We are given that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 6x.

We are also given that she mowed a total of 9x lawns. Since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, and we know that she mowed a total of 9x lawns, we can set up the equation x + 3x + 5x = 9x. However, this equation is true for all values of x, so we need to use the information that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn.

Since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, and she made $6 from mowing his lawn, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales. The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 6x = 80 - 6(1) = 80 - 6 = 74.

The final answer is: $74"

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.
2. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7.

Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha had initially as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Initially, Martha had x notebooks. After buying 5 more, she had x + 5 notebooks.

We are given that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

x = 7 - 5
x = 2

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had:

Joseph had 3x = 3(2) = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

7 (Martha's notebooks) - 6 (Joseph's notebooks) = 1

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the remaining number of cookies is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 / 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), the total number of adult bowls that can be filled is 3. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl equals 2 child bowls. Therefore, 3 adult bowls equal 6 child bowls. 

So, the total number of child bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup is 6.

There are 2 children, and we want to know how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. To find this out, we divide the total number of child bowls by the number of children: 6 / 2 = 3.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 
2. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
   We know Duncan's current age is 60, so his age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.
   Therefore, the equation becomes: 52 = 2x
3. To find Adam's age four years ago, we need to solve for 'x'. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 52 / 2
   x = 26
4. Since we found Adam's age four years ago, we need to add 4 to find his current age: Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days and then divide that by 1000 miles per tune-up.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per tune-up:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total amount of money spent is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $31.

To find out how much each of them received, we need to divide the total amount by 2: $31 / 2 = $15.50.

The final answer is: $15.50"

"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of each type of pet together: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day. 
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

"To find the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and has a birthday every year, she has been collecting shells for 5 years. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of months she has been collecting shells is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the total number of months she has been collecting shells, which is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row. 

Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row: 27 / 3 = 9 cups per row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is half of the total cups in each row. 

9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, he can make 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine how much water was initially transferred to the tank from the pool. Since they filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons will be used.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 1000 gallons.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given the following information:
1. P + Pp + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. Pp = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = Pp + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

From equation 3, we can substitute Pp with J + 10:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute P in equation 1:
(2J + 10) + Pp + J = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using equation 2:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age using equation 3:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of 5 * $40 = $200 from selling them.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the money he made from the price after discount. 

Money James was out = Price after discount - Money made from selling CDs

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James took to swim 60% of the distance.
Distance = 20 miles
Speed = 2 miles per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours
60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time James rested on the island.
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 6 hours
Time rested = 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance.
Remaining distance = 20 - 12 = 8 miles

Step 4: Calculate the time James took to swim the remaining distance at half the speed.
Speed = 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 8 / 1 = 8 hours

Step 5: Calculate the total time taken by adding the time taken to swim 60% of the distance, the time rested, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
Total time = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 = x - 10 points.

The total points scored by the team is 45, and the sum of points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x - 10) + (x + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x = 45.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored x - 10 = 15 - 10 = 5 points.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept for 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier from her usual sleep time: 480 - 23 - 25 = 432 minutes.

"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital.

Total capacity = 1000 beds
Occupied beds initially = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is equal to 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. We add the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted.

Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 beds + 700 patients = 900 beds

Since the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, we can find the total number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the total capacity.

Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
= 1000 beds - 900 beds

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to family.

The remaining non-work emails (after subtracting the family emails) are 9 - 6 = 3. One-third of these emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 2, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

From point 1, we can find Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's assume the number reported by Courtney is 100%. 

20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Actual number of people = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Actual number of people = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of balls, we need to determine how many balls each boy carried and add them up.

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day. 

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, making the total 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, making the total 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 29. To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Since the total number of corn chips is divided equally among three people, but one person gets 15 more, we can represent the total number of corn chips as 3x + 15, where x is the number of corn chips each of the first two people gets.

However, we know that the first two people got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation 3x + 15 = 70 + 70.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 15 = 140.

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get 3x = 125.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 41.67. However, since the number of corn chips must be a whole number, this is not possible.

However, we can re-evaluate the problem. If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into the simplified equation: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is the sum of the first and third distances:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles + 110 miles
Total southerly distance = 410 miles

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the total southerly distance minus the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance = Total southerly distance - Northerly distance
Distance = 410 miles - 36 miles
Distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of string and then add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones. 

The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining 2 phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost for all 4 phones is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to first find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can add 7 to 13 to find the number of players in Zeke's team.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)
Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the ones she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many oranges that is, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of oranges she bought, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and the ones she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought: 240 - 60 - 80 = 100 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges.

"To find the total number of states in both countries together, we first need to find the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

Let's assume the number of states in India is x. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we can write the equation as:

x = (50 / 2) + 4
x = 25 + 4
x = 29

Now, we know that India has 29 states.

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the number of states in the USA and India:

Total states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India)
Total states = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

Total cherries = 60
Richard's cherries + Robert's cherries + Jerry's cherries = 60
20 + 30 + Jerry's cherries = 60
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days and then multiply it by their respective prices.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. So, G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Let's denote the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday as B. Then, A = B - 4.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

We also know that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, B = 15.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday by substituting B = 15 into the equation A = B - 4. A = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days:

- Total gingerbread boxes: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25
- Total apple pie boxes: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie by their respective prices:

- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150
- Total earnings from apple pie: 26 * $15 = $390

Total earnings for two days: $150 + $390 = $540

"To determine the total number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use and divide it by the amount of sunscreen in each bottle.

Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so she will be outside for a total of 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount percentage = 40%

Discount amount = 40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount amount
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices:
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that when Emil is 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From point 2, we know that when Emil is 24, his dad's age will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, we need to find his dad's and brother's ages now. 

Dad's current age = 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil will be 24 in 5 years)
Brother's current age = 12 - 5 = 7 years old (since brother will be 12 in 5 years)

The sum of their ages now is 43 + 7 = 50.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by 3: 21 / 3 = 7.

Now, we need to find 25% of the remaining students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet. We need to convert this to inches as well.

24 feet = 24 * 12 = 288 inches

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed in inches.

1332 - 288 = 1044 inches

Now, we need to divide the remaining space by the width of each plant to find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed.

1044 / 12 = 87

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract 17 from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed to find out how many more plants she needs to buy.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

This is her monthly savings for shoes. To find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we can divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes for both tasks. So, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's denote Bill's age at that time as 'x'. 

We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Therefore, when Bill saw the comet for the second time, his dad's age would be 30 + (x - 30) = x, since the time difference between the two events is the same as the age difference between Bill and his dad at that time.

However, we also know that the time difference between the two events is 75 years, since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x - 30 = 75

Solving for x, we get:

x = 105

This means that when Bill saw the comet for the second time, he was 105 years old. 

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that the time difference between the two events is 75 years. Therefore, we can subtract 75 from 105 to get:

105 - 75 = 30

However, this is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. We need to find Bill's age at that time. Since Bill's age is three times his dad's age at that time, we can set up the equation:

Bill's age = 3 * 30
Bill's age = 90

However, this is Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time. We need to find his age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the time difference between the two events is 75 years, we can subtract 75 from 90 to get:

90 - 75 = 15

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet. We know that Bill's age is three times his dad's age at that time. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Bill's age = 3 * (Bill's dad's age)

We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Bill's age = 3 * 30
Bill's age = 90

However, this is Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time. We need to find his age when his dad saw the comet. We know that the time difference between the two events is 75 years. Therefore, we can subtract 75 from 90 to get:

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months (quarterly), so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's assume the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day is x.
2. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x.
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2)((1/4)x) = (1/8)x.
4. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. So, the total number of flights made by the first plane is 2 * 44 = 88.
5. Since we assumed the total number of flights made by the first plane is x, we can set up the equation x = 88.
6. Now, we can find the number of flights to France by substituting x = 88 into the equation (1/8)x.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3 + 4 = 20

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 13

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 13/3

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3

We also know that the total age of the group is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3 + 4 = 20

We already know that x = 13/3. We can substitute this value into the equation:

(13/3) + 2(13/3) + 3 + 4 = 20

Combine like terms:

(13/3) + (26/3) + 7 = 20

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected by Walter before his friend donates $200. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend donates $200, making the total amount collected $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The final answer is: $6600"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of guests at the wedding by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, we need to find 1/2 of 1500 cookies.

1/2 of 1500 cookies = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church next door, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of people in the church next door = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. 

Let's say each kid gets x units of watermelon. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets 2x units.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (since there are 4 kids), and the total amount given to the adults is 2x + 2x = 4x (since there are 2 adults).

The total amount of watermelon given to the family is 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 8x = 100.

To find x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 100 / 8 = 12.5.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of watermelon each adult gets: 2x = 2 * 12.5 = 25.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Converting 300 minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Total hours worked: 9 hours

Time left to update records: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs to start making the cake 3 hours before 5:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total cost per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

However, this is the total number of babies born in a year. Since the question asks for the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to add the number of babies born to the initial population.

Initial population = 50
Babies born in a year = 1440
Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons of water needed, we do the following:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled between Shandy and Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Male students over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375
4. Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students:
Female students = 1125 + 750 = 1875

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. To do this, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract this from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is 10 * 40 = $400.

She also makes $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly income from tips is 15 * 40 = $600.

Her total weekly income is the sum of her wage and tips, which is 400 + 600 = $1000.

The down payment for the car is $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * 10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her total weekly income ($1000). 

2000 / 1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since Anne kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since Anne gave the 13 packs to 10 friends, we divide 13 by 10 to get 1.3 packs per friend. However, since each pack contains 60 pieces, we multiply 1.3 packs by 60 pieces to get the total number of pieces each friend received.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first determine the number of pictures in each album. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. 
Selfies only = 3 albums * Pictures per album
Selfies only = 3 * 9
Selfies only = 27
Portraits only = 2 albums * Pictures per album
Portraits only = 2 * 9
Portraits only = 18

Since we don't have information about the mix of selfies and portraits in the 3 remaining albums, we can't find the exact number of selfies and portraits separately. However, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits. 

Total selfies and portraits = Selfies only + Portraits only
Total selfies and portraits = 27 + 18
Total selfies and portraits = 45

"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 + 15 = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 (guests who have not checked out) + 37 (guests who have checked in) = 74.

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find out how many she is sure to get in each category.

First, let's find out how many questions are easy, average, and difficult.

Total questions = 60
Easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
Average and difficult questions = 60 - 24 = 36
Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult, 
Average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
Difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's find out how many points Aries is sure to get in each category.

Easy questions = 24
Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions = 0.75 * 24 = 18
Average questions = 18
Aries is sure to get half of the average questions = 18 / 2 = 9
Difficult questions = 18
Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions = 18 / 2 = 9

Now, let's add up the points Aries is sure to get in each category.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.
2. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.
3. We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, which is $12.
4. The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.
5. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can substitute this into the equation from step 4: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.
7. To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.
8. Since x = 2y (from step 2), we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2, indicating that the price per sandwich is constant across the first two packages.

Since the price per sandwich is constant, we can use the ratio of the number of sandwiches in the third package (8) to the number of sandwiches in the first package (2) to find the price of the third package. 

The ratio is 8/2 = 4. Since the price per sandwich is the same as the first package, we multiply the price of the first package ($3) by 4 to find the price of the third package.

Price of the third package = 3 * 4 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate how much he still owes after selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each incident.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). 

However, the third scenario is dependent on the second scenario not happening, so we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus convincing her, which is 60% (100% - 40%) * 20% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the first two scenarios and the third scenario: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability cannot exceed 100%. 

The correct approach is to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, which is 100% - (50% + 40% + 12%) = 100% - 102% = -2%. However, this is also not possible since the total probability cannot be negative. 

The correct approach is to find the probability that the normal teacher gives an extension and Marcus convinces her, which is 40% * 20% = 8%. Then, the probability that the normal teacher doesn't give an extension is 60%. The probability that Marcus convinces the teacher that his dog ate his assignment is 20%. The probability that the substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework is 50%. 

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is 8% + 60% * 20% + 50% = 8% + 12% + 50% = 70%. 

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 70% = 30%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to first calculate the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates: 950
Available seats for guests: 4750
Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat in terms of the large beans. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

We are also given that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans. 

Now, we need to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat in terms of the large beans. We know that he can eat 150 medium-sized beans, and 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans. 

So, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is 150 * 3 = 450.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: $15 per day * 3 days = $45
Total expenses: $3 per day * 3 days = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly wage after expenses:
Hourly wage = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly wage = $36 / 18
Hourly wage = $2

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first find out how many soda bottles he can place along the driveway. 

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. 

Number of soda bottles = Total length of driveway / Distance between each soda bottle
= 24 feet / 3 feet
= 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to go to 7 more bottles (8 total bottles - 1 starting bottle = 7). 

Time taken to go to each bottle = 5 seconds
Total time taken = Time taken to go to each bottle * Number of remaining bottles
= 5 seconds * 7
= 35 seconds

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money, we get:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of each fabric piece will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet (bed length) + 2 feet (additional length) = 10 feet, and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to calculate the area of one piece and then multiply it by 2.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width = 10 * 10 = 100 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area of fabric he needs is 2 * 100 = 200 square feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

1. First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost in the first race: -$5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount he won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount he lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.
4. Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007, so we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

The initial price of the car is $20,000.

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.

To calculate the depreciation for each year, we can use the formula:

Depreciation = Initial Price x Depreciation Rate

For 2008:
Depreciation = $20,000 x 21% = $20,000 x 0.21 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

For 2009:
Depreciation = $15,800 x 21% = $15,800 x 0.21 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

For 2010:
Depreciation = $12,482 x 21% = $12,482 x 0.21 = $2,623.22
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,623.22 = $9,858.78

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,858.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.

10% of the books are written in German, so the number of German books is 50 * 0.1 = 5.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of each tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of each tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt) to find the total number of tiles required:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile ($12):

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, which is a total of 4 sheets at a time.

Now, we divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets he can wash at a time: 5 sheets / 4 sheets per load = 1.25 loads. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Greg does 2 loads of laundry per week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The average score is 95."
"To find the number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10. 

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Now, Sidney has 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. 

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. Now, he has 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

6 * 4 = 24

The total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24."
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find the number of trucks that did not have mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we need to find a quarter of 20. 

A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures. 

The number of trucks that did not have mechanical failures is 20 - 5 = 15.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion.

Since Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means that for every 2 pounds of butter, he will pay the full price of 1 pound. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 3 pounds at the full price and 3 pounds at half the price.

The cost of 3 pounds at the full price is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

The cost of 3 pounds at half the price is 3 * ($4.00 / 2) = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the base fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests
However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41

Since the base fee is for 20 guests, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21

Now, let's calculate the cost for the additional guests: 
21 guests * $6 per guest = $126

Now, add the base fee and the cost for the additional guests: 
$125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Maggie had x dollars initially. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4x dollars left. Riza had the same amount initially, so she also has 3/4x dollars left.

We know that both of them have $60 left, so we can set up the equation:

3/4x = 60

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

So, Maggie and Riza each had $80 initially.

Now, let's find out how much money they spent. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * 80 = $20. Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * 80 = $26.67.

The total amount of money they spent is $20 + $26.67 = $46.67.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

Total initial amount = 2 * 80 = $160
Total amount spent = $46.67
Total amount left = $160 - $46.67 = $113.33

The final answer is: $113.33"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats.

We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205.

However, since we are looking for the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to find the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week, the first monkey eats 10 * 7 = 70 bananas.

The second monkey eats 14 bananas each day, so in a week, the second monkey eats 14 * 7 = 98 bananas.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Now, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas to find the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week: 2205 - 168 = 2037. However, this is the total for a week, not a day. 

To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7: 2037 / 7 = 291. 

However, this is incorrect because we are given that the total number of bananas is 315, and we are looking for the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205. However, this is not the case here. 

The total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205. However, this is not the case here. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, and the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day. The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days, we can set up the equation: 24 * 7 + x * 7 = 315 * 7, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day.

Simplifying the equation, we get 168 + 7x = 2205.

Subtracting 168 from both sides, we get 7x = 2037.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 291. 

However, this is incorrect because we are given that the total number of bananas is 315, and we are looking for the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, and the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day. The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days, we can set up the equation: 24 * 7 + x * 7 = 315 * 7.

However, this is not the correct equation. The correct equation is 315 = 10x + 14x + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day.

Simplifying the equation, we get 315 = 25x.

Dividing both sides by 25, we get x = 12.6."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. 

Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

A dozen roses cost $15. 
3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. 
Total cost = $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas
Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30
Total revenue = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits for the first three trains as well.

- He waits for the first train from 0 to 10 minutes.
- He waits for the second train from 30 to 65 minutes.
- He waits for the third train from 65 to 125 minutes.

The total time Paul waits for the first three trains is 10 + (65 - 30) + (125 - 65) = 10 + 35 + 60 = 105 minutes.

Adding this to the time he waits for the fourth train, we get 105 + 40 (145 - 105) = 145 minutes.

However, this is the time from the start, and we need to find the time Paul waits for the fourth train after the third train leaves. So, we need to subtract the time the third train leaves from the time the fourth train arrives, which is 145 - 125 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first calculate how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
So, the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, she needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide 80 by 10. 
80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

$2000 x 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

$1500 x 1.20 = $1800

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price he paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount = ((Original Price - Price Paid) / Original Price) x 100
= (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) x 100
= ($200 / $2000) x 100
= 0.10 x 100
= 10%

"To find the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created is 5 times the number created by one spring.

5 * 14400 = 72000

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to twice Binkie's score to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip distance. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the total time taken.

Time = distance / speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

However, this is the total time taken for the round trip. We need to find the time taken to reach the store initially. Since James walked halfway to the store and then back home, the time taken to reach the store initially is half of the total time.

Time taken to reach the store = Total time / 2
Time taken to reach the store = 2 hours / 2
Time taken to reach the store = 1 hour

"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we need to calculate the cost of 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas each. 

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence given to Sam and Harry from the total length of the fence:

100 - (20 + (20 + 60)) = 100 - 100 = 0

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks how much is left over for Sam, implying that the leftover is the portion that is not given to either Sam or Harry. Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, and Sam and Harry together get 20 + (20 + 60) = 100 feet, there is no leftover fence for Sam.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how much more fence Sam gets compared to the leftover, then the leftover is 0, and the amount Sam gets is 20 feet."
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine the rate at which it grows per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the annual growth rate, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we multiply the annual growth rate by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years:

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's break down the information:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The total number of bales made is 30, and the total number of bales picked up is 18. To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is spent on these days. His weekly minutes are 1200, so 1/16 of 1200 is (1/16) * 1200 = 75 minutes.

The total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday is 75 * 2 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1200 + 150 = 1350 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 1350 / 60 = 22.5 hours.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 of the initial height:
(2/3) * 24 = 16 feet

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 of the height after the first bounce:

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors ate. 

Let's call the weight left after the velociraptors ate ""x"". Since the Allosaurus ate half of this, we can set up the equation: x / 2 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2 = 540.

Now, we know that the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the weight left after the T-Rex ate ""y"". Since the velociraptors ate half of this, we can set up the equation: y / 2 = 540.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2: y = 540 * 2 = 1080.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Let's call the original weight of the triceratops ""z"". Since the T-Rex ate half of this, we can set up the equation: z / 2 = 1080.

To solve for z, we multiply both sides by 2: z = 1080 * 2 = 2160.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7
To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:
Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they traveled, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of days Billy works, we first need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works.

50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day.

2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day

Now, multiply the number of people he can help per day by the number of days he works.

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside the church is the sum of the number of cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who attended the wedding:
32 people (outside the church) + 480 people (transported) = 512 people

However, this is the total number of people who attended the wedding, not the number of people inside the church. To find the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding:
512 people - 32 people = 480 people

However, this is the number of people who attended the wedding, not the number of people inside the church.  We need to subtract the number of people who were transported by the buses and cars from the total number of people who attended the wedding to find the number of people inside the church.  Since the number of people who were transported by the buses and cars is 480, we can subtract that number from the total number of people who attended the wedding:
512 people - 480 people = 32 people

The final answer is: 32"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to first find Martha's age, and then add 10 to it.

Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can find Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
To find the total time spent over 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah's distance, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towels: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. New balance: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large. Let's call the total number of jellyfish 'x'. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This means 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3) * (x/5) = x/15.

3. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. This is equal to the number of large jellyfish that change color. So, we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

4. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15. This gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses during retirement. 40% of her current annual salary is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses during retirement will be 20 * $40,000 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her current salary, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount needed by the amount she saves per year: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement expenses. Since she plans to live for 20 years after retirement, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of years to find out how many more years she needs to work: 40 - 20 = 20 years.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the total number of students that 40% represents. 

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To find the total number of students, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240

"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the total miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since there are 3 people in total, and we are assuming James is the third person, we need to find out how much the other two people will take. However, the question does not mention James taking any amount of apples. 

Given the information, we can assume that James is the one who bought the apples and is now distributing them. 

So, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

"To find the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers, we need to calculate the production rate of each group and then add them together.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.
The total production rate of the first 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the total order is 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is 180 / 10 = 18.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

From point 1, we know A = M.

From point 2, we know C + S = 30.

From point 3, we know C = S + 12.

We can substitute C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30 to get:
S + 12 + S = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, and A + M + C + S = 56, we can substitute the values of C and S:
A + M + 21 + 9 = 56
Combine like terms:
A + M + 30 = 56
Subtract 30 from both sides:
A + M = 26

Since A = M, we can substitute A for M:
A + A = 26
Combine like terms:
2A = 26
Divide both sides by 2:
A = 13

Now that we know A = 13 and C = 21, we can find the difference between C and A:
C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. To find the total number of boxes, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to find the total weight of the boxes in ounces first. 

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is equal to the total number of crayons:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we add the total weight of the boxes and the total weight of the crayons to find the total weight:

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to find the total weight in pounds:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Let's assume the speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. So, the speed on the beach can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed * Time
2 = x * 40
x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, let's calculate the time taken to walk 1 mile on the beach and the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time on the beach = 2 / (1/20) = 40 minutes
Time on the sidewalk = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes

Since the total distance is 3 miles, and we know the time taken for the beach and sidewalk, we can find the total time taken for the entire walk:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 10
Total time = 50 minutes

2. If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles he had. 

Initial marbles = 36
Marbles lost = 10
Marbles left = Initial marbles - Marbles lost
Marbles left = 36 - 10
Marbles left = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows (initial) + 420 cows (added) = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens (initial) + 210 chickens (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, we need to calculate the original price and then apply the discount. 

The original price of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price. 
Discounted price = Original price - Discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since each pack has 9 bagels, we need to find the cost of each bagel by dividing the discounted price by the number of bagels. 
Cost per bagel = Discounted price / Number of bagels = $36.00 / 9 = $4.00

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate. 

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 * 1.5 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red and green jellybeans. 

There are 17 green jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10 (since a decade has 10 years).

First, let's find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a year:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply this by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many bouquets and individual sunflowers he sold per day. 

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total amount earned from bouquets is 12 times the cost of a bouquet, which is 12 * $8 = $96. However, he only earned $56 from the bouquets, so the difference is $96 - $56 = $40. This $40 must be the amount earned from selling individual sunflowers. 

Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is $40 / $2 = 20 sunflowers.

Now, we need to find out how many sunflowers he sold in 3 days. The number of sunflowers sold in 3 days is 20 * 3 = 60 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

Adam has $100 to invest, and each rock costs $5. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 rocks * $5/rock = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 (cost of 20 rocks) - $84 (revenue from 12 rocks) = $16 (loss from selling 12 rocks)
+ $40 (cost of 8 unsold rocks) = $56 (total loss)

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes she needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers, so it will take Lauren at least 8820 / 5 = 1764 days to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, 8820 / 6 = 1470 days to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 8820 / 7 = 1260 days to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes. However, since the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1764, 1470, and 1260.

The prime factorization of 1764 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^2.
The prime factorization of 1470 is 2 * 3 * 5 * 7^2.
The prime factorization of 1260 is 2^2 * 3^3 * 5 * 7.

To find the GCD, we take the lowest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
GCD(1764, 1470, 1260) = 2 * 3 * 7^2 = 294.

Now, we divide each number by the GCD to find the number of days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 1764 / 294 = 6 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 1470 / 294 = 5 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 1260 / 294 = 4.3 days (round up to 5 days since you can't draw a fraction of a day)

The greatest number of days it will take Lauren to draw all the picture scenes is the GCD, which is 294."

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month of May, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times 0.2, which is 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can write an equation: 2x + 5 = 27.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 22.

Now, divide both sides by 2: x = 11.

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells. 

Now, we know that Carlos collected 2x = 2 * 11 = 22 seashells. 

Jim collected 27 seashells. 

The total number of seashells collected is 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 2 x $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 2 devices, the total profit from Monday is 2 x $20 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 4 x $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 4 devices, the total profit from Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Since 1/4 of the babies wear blue, the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

The number of babies wearing blue and bows is 2. 

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 1/3 of the purple wearers, which is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the babies wearing blue and purple bows, which is 2 + 2 = 4.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of babies wearing purple bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So far, he has sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. This leaves him with 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree to calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now that we know the production of a 10-year-old tree, we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x = 1000, so the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, we can add up the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y = 12, we can find B by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B = 5, we can find R by substituting B into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

2. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given to the little sister 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

3. According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

4. We can simplify the equation: $15 - x = $12.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.
2. The mural is half yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.
3. The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, which is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. So, we can write the equation: 3x + 6 = 12.
4. To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 12 - 6, 3x = 6.
5. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: x = 6 / 3, x = 2.
6. Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

"To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100.

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost.

Number of cycles per dollar = Number of pods / Cost
= 120 / 12
= 10

So, the new box can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the total number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. He triples his money, which means he now has 3 times the value of the remaining bills. Since each bill is $20, the total value is 20 * 20 * 3 = $1200. 

5. Since the total value is $1200, and each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1200 / 20 = 60 bills.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now $5, the number of 5 dollar bills is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match. In the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals.

Total goals scored by team A = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Total goals scored by team B = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals scored in the match = 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days the 5-inch piece of chalk will last when used at 20% per day, and then subtract the days it was used at 45% on Monday.

First, let's find out how many days the 5-inch piece of chalk will last at 20% per day. 

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of 5 inches is used each day. 

0.2 * 5 = 1 inch per day

Since the chalk is 5 inches long, it will last for 5 / 1 = 5 days at 20% per day.

However, on Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. 

Now, the remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days the 2.75-inch piece of chalk will last.

0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

Now, let's divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day:

2.75 / 0.55 = 5 days

However, we need to subtract the day the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so the total number of days is 5 - 1 = 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the total number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total cost of the milk, we need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. 

Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5
= 8000 / 5
= 1600 gallons

The cost of the returned milk is 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5,600."
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples.
3. He picked up the 5 new apples and put all but one in his pocket. This means he has 1 apple left outside and 6 apples in his pocket.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples in his pocket, 1 apple outside, and 6 new apples.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which are the 6 new apples that fell out of the tree.

"To determine the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza needs to be cut into, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the total number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds per minute and how many melt per minute, and then calculate the net change in the number of snowballs per minute.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, so he builds 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so they melt 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net change in the number of snowballs per minute is (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to build 60 snowballs. 

Let's set up an equation: 

Initial snowballs + (net change per minute * time) = 60
0 + (1/5 * time) = 60

To solve for time, we multiply both sides by 5:
time = 60 * 5
time = 300 minutes

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to build 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are (x - 16) - 25 + 100 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

"To calculate Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total regular pay is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Since she has complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for each day she works. There are 6 days in a week, and she works 4 weeks, so she works a total of:
6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days

Her attendance bonus is:
24 days * $10/day = $240

Her total earnings are the sum of her regular pay and her attendance bonus:

"To find the total amount John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. 

To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the total amount of the second medicine in one dose, we need to multiply 14 mL by 3. 

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

Now, we know that one dose consists of 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine. To find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we add these two amounts together.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Since we need to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class capacity is 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

However, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, which is a total of 11 * 25 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest minus the total amount paid in the previous 11 months. 

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers changed per day. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan changes the remaining half of the diapers, he also changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height of the jar is 15 inches, so the volume is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume of the jar that can be occupied by jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know his guess. Since we don't know his guess, we can calculate the percentage difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Let's assume Tim's guess is x. The percentage difference is ((x - 900) / 900) * 100.

To find the actual difference, we need to find the value of x that would give us the same percentage difference as the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans. 

The difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans is 864 - 900 = -36. 

The percentage difference is (-36 / 900) * 100 = -4%.

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation: ((x - 900) / 900) * 100 = -4.

Solving for x, we get: (x - 900) / 900 = -0.04
x - 900 = -36
x = 864

So, Tim's guess was 864. The difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans is 864 - 900 = -36.

The final answer is: -36"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we need to find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are 180 people on the bus. 

The number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total number of students who will try the escape room, we need to multiply the number of students in each grade by the number of grades. 

There are 4 grades (4-7) and 10 students in each grade. 

Total students = 4 * 10 = 40

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups will be needed.

Number of groups = Total students / 8 = 40 / 8 = 5

Since each group uses 45 minutes, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group uses to find the total time.

Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 5 * 45 = 225 minutes

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, which is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces. So, we can write the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. 
   Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. 
   We can write this as B = 3C - 2.

2. Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. 
   The total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

3. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. 
   We can write this as C + B = 10.

4. Substitute the expression for B from step 1 into the equation in step 3. 
   C + (3C - 2) = 10

5. Combine like terms. 
   4C - 2 = 10

"To find the total cost, first, calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. 

The original cost of a manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40. The total cost of both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

A 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, calculate the cost of nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each costs $3. So, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen is the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

1. The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.
2. The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.
3. The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues from all magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the total number of issues. Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues, we need to find the total number of magazines. 

We know that the first 3 magazines send 12 issues each, the second magazine sends 6 issues, and the third magazine sends 24 issues. To find the total number of magazines, we can divide the total number of issues by the number of issues each magazine sends.

Let's assume the third magazine sends x issues. We already know that x = 24. 

The total number of issues is 66. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of issues: 3 * 12 + 6 + x = 66. We already know that x = 24, so we can plug this value into the equation: 3 * 12 + 6 + 24 = 66. This equation is true, so we can proceed.

Now, let's find the total number of magazines. We know that the first 3 magazines send 12 issues each, the second magazine sends 6 issues, and the third magazine sends 24 issues. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of magazines: 3 + 1 + 1 = total number of magazines. We know that the third magazine sends 24 issues, which is 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. This means that the third magazine is the same as the second magazine, so we only have 2 unique magazines. 

However, we know that the first 3 magazines send 12 issues each, so we have 3 magazines that send 12 issues each. We also have 1 magazine that sends 6 issues. We also have 1 magazine that sends 24 issues. So, the total number of magazines is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the decrease in January.

Initial price in November: $40
Price increase in December: 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
Price in December: $40 + $32 = $72
Price decrease in January: 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
Price in January: $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the reduced-rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced-rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at 75% of his standard rate (since he reduces his rate by 25%). The reduced rate is:
$80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour

The total amount from reduced-rate lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the amounts from standard and reduced-rate lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum of the scores by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine what 1/4 of the original amount is. 

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. 

1/4 of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, she must have given away the remaining 3/4 of the pomelos. 

3/4 of 20 is 20 * (3/4) = 15.

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = 81

"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and 4 is the reciprocal of 3/4).

Let's start by setting up the equation:

9 novels = 3/4 * x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 9 * 4/3
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he covers in one day and then multiply it by 3.

Distance covered in one day = Speed * Time
Since speed is given in km/hr, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance covered in one day = 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km
Total distance covered in 3 days = 1200 km * 3 = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
= (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
= 0.6 * 100

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes initially, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 boxes in a year (52 weeks). The total cost of the pasta is 52 * $1.00 = $52.00.

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the cheddar cheese is 52 * $3.00 = $156.00.

The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the gruyere cheese is 52 * $6.00 = $312.00.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese is the sum of the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $52.00 + $156.00 + $312.00 = $520.00.

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. 

First, we need to find the total number of minutes the custodian has to clean the classrooms. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day. 

Since they have 5 days, the total number of minutes they have to clean the classrooms is 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find the total number of minutes it takes to clean all the classrooms. Since it takes them 15 minutes per classroom, and there are 80 classrooms, it will take them 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms. To do this, we need to divide the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of minutes they have to clean the classrooms, and then multiply by 100.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as M. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2M. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2M - 5.

We know that each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, M = 10. 

The capacity of the bottom shelf is 2M = 2 * 10 = 20 books. The capacity of the top shelf is 2M - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 10 (middle shelf) + 10 (middle shelf) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are required to hold all of them. 

To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost price and the total selling price of the eggs.

First, let's find the total cost price. Since Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost price is:
5 * $2.40 = $12

Next, let's find the total number of eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, 5 dozens will be:
5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Now, let's find the total selling price. Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1, so the selling price for 60 eggs will be:
60 / 3 * $1 = $20

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

New price = Original price - Discount
New price = $18.00 - $3.00
New price = $15.00

Since the new price is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents to match the number of sticks (which is a unit of quantity, not price). There are 100 cents in a dollar.

New price in cents = New price * 100
New price in cents = $15.00 * 100
New price in cents = 1500 cents

Now, we can find the cost of each stick of jerky by dividing the new price in cents by the number of sticks.

Cost per stick = New price in cents / Number of sticks
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30
Cost per stick = 50 cents

"To determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to move on to the 7th grade, we first need to find the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly out of the total questions in both tests. 

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. 

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate this as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions she answered correctly in the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly in the second test, we subtract the number of questions she answered correctly in the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly. 

77 - 42 = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting B = 5S - 4 into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S = 20, we can find B by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

For the rooms, half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms in total, half of them is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time it takes for each side.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"To find the new speaking speed of John, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the new speed to words per second by dividing by 60.

New speed (words per second) = 375 WPM / 60 = 6.25 words per second

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speed in words per second.

Time = Total words / New speed (words per second) = 4500 words / 6.25 words/second = 720 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the time to minutes by dividing by 60.

Time (minutes) = 720 seconds / 60 = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 1.5 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he will make. He will make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade. 

Since the extra tart lemonade is twice as tart as the regular lemonade, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice. So, for the extra tart lemonade, he will need 2 cups of lemon juice.

For the regular lemonade, he will need 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.

In total, he will need 4 cups (for the regular lemonade) + 2 cups (for the extra tart lemonade) = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need 6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons.

The full-priced T-shirt costs $8.
The discounted T-shirt costs 50% off of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4.
So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40 and they are 40% off. 
The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The cost of the shoes is the original price minus the discount, which is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the cost of the T-shirts plus the cost of the shoes, which is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing his chores and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket: $13 ÷ $6.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $2"

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar of the mixture and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost of making one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The selling price of one jar is $50. 

The profit from selling one jar is: $50 - $44 = $6

To find the profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit from one jar by 10:
$6 * 10 = $60

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so in 30 cars, he makes 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the total number of cookies he had initially and then subtract the cookies he ate or gave away, and add the cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

Total initial cookies = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. 
So, he ate 3 cookies in total.

Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Randy baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
So, he baked 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
Total initial cookies - cookies eaten or given away + cookies baked = 18 - 3 - 2 - 2 + 12
Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12
Total cookies now = 23

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves: 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers for each half.

For the first half, he would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, he would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the two halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
2. Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
3. The total number of items Igor had is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes he gathered. Let's denote the number of beakers he gathered as B. The total number of items is the sum of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes: 8 + B + 16 = 29.
4. To find the number of beakers, we need to solve the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.
5. Subtract 24 (8 + 16) from both sides of the equation: B = 29 - 24.
6. B = 5.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa. 

Let's assume Aaron's speed is A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed is V miles per minute. We are given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron runs 2 miles.

Since Aaron's speed is A miles per minute, the time it takes him to run 2 miles is 2/A minutes. We are given that this time is 16 minutes, so 2/A = 16.

Now we can solve for A: A = 2/16 = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since A = 2V, we can substitute this value of A into the equation: 2V = 1/8. 

Now we can solve for V: V = (1/8)/2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

The time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles is 4/V = 4/(1/16) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Daily revenue = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily revenue = $10 + $5
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2:
Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $15 * 2
Weekly revenue = $30

"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of watermelons. 

Cost of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of each watermelon. The profit is 25% of the cost price.

Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit = $0.40

Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price + Profit
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To find the current age of James, we need to first find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19, so the time that has passed since John was 19 is the same as James' current age, which is 18 years. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the time that has passed since John was 32 is the same as the youngest son's current age. Therefore, the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find the total amount Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20:

$400 * 0.20 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

The mechanic charges $50 per hour and works for 3 hours, so the labor cost is:

$50 * 3 = $150

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost:

$80 + $150 = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

W = 15

Now that we know W, we can substitute it into the first equation to find C:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm. 

The final answer is: 5"
