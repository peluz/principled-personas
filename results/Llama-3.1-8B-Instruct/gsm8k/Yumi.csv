"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the eggs she used from the total number of eggs she laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% is the same as 1.5 times the original value)

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 2.5x

Now, divide both sides by 2.5 to solve for x: 
x = 130,000 / 2.5
x = 52,000

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we need to subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = New value - Original cost
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000
Profit = -28,000

However, since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, we need to add that to the profit to find the total profit: 
Total profit = Profit + Repairs
Total profit = -28,000 + 50,000
Total profit = 22,000

The final answer is: $22,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. 

Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal.

Feed needed in the final meal = Total feed needed per meal - Total feed given in the morning and afternoon
= 60 - 40
= 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.0829376, $0.04956256, $0.029837696, $0.017902816, $0.0107458496, $0.00644751424, $0.003823478592, $0.002294089552, $0.0013764549376.

To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of all the glasses. 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.0829376 + $0.04956256 + $0.029837696 + $0.017902816 + $0.0107458496 + $0.00644751424 + $0.003823478592 + $0.002294089552 + $0.0013764549376 = $24.999999999999998

However, we can simplify this process by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The first term is $5, the common ratio is 0.6, and the number of terms is 16. 

The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)
S = $5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4
S = $5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4
S = $5 * 2.49959726671875
S = $12.4974863345625

However, this is the sum of the first 16 terms of the sequence, but we need to add the cost of the first glass. 
Total cost = $12.4974863345625 + $5
Total cost = $17.4974863345625

The final answer is: $17.50"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes

Next, let's add the time it takes to install the updates:
40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

Now, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB at 2 GB/minute is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes

Finally, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time to install the updates, and the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:
40 minutes + 60 minutes + 60 minutes = 160 minutes

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 3 hours, John drove at 60 mph:
Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

For the first 2 hours of the return trip, John was stuck in traffic, so he didn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

For the next half-hour, John drove at 30 mph:
Distance = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 2.5 hours of the return trip, John drove at 80 mph:
Distance = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Now, let's add up the distances:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 200 = 395 miles

However, since John is on his way back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from home to the point where he turned around (180 miles) from the total distance to find out how far he is from home:
Distance from home = Total distance - Distance traveled to the point of return
Distance from home = 395 - 180
Distance from home = 215 miles

The final answer is: 215"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime pay rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

Her earnings for the week are $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We want to find the smallest 'x' for which $7.5x ≥ $90.

Dividing both sides by $7.5, we get x ≥ $90 / $7.5.

x ≥ 12

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take 13 years for the tree to start earning money. 

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. She sold 2 more at the red house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house.
4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

From point 1, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x left after the green house sale.

From point 2, she sold 2 more at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 left after the red house sale.

From point 3, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has ((2/3)x - 2)/2 left after the orange house sale.

From point 4, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

((2/3)x - 2)/2 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get:

(2/3)x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

(2/3)x = 12

Multiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for x:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance is 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, which is 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the item that will increase in value the most. 

First, let's calculate the increase in value for each item:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Since the problem doesn't specify the speed of the trains, we can assume they travel at the same speed. Let's denote the speed of the trains as 's'. 

The distance covered by each train in the first day is 80 miles. 

The distance covered by each train in the second day is 150 miles.

The total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances covered in the first and second day. 

Total distance = 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

Since both trains travel the same distance, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a teacher is 35 * 50 = 1750 hours.
Her hourly wage is $20, so her total earnings from teaching is 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a coach is 15 * 50 = 750 hours.
Her hourly wage is $30, so her total earnings from coaching is 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her annual salary:
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500."
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 x 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa wants to take to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Since Marissa has already taken 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, she has taken a total of 2 hours so far. 

The remaining time she has to complete the trail is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - (4 miles + 2 miles) = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the non-water portion is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the remaining two-fifths is non-water. So, the non-water portion is 15 - 9 = 6 liters.

Now, we have 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink. We spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The remaining water in the orange drink is 6.67 - 1/3 of 1 liter (since 1 liter was spilled) = 6.67 - 0.33 = 6.34 liters.

The total amount of water is 6.34 + 9 = 15.34 liters.

However, we need to find the water in the remaining 24 liters. Since we have 9 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total amount of non-water in the mixture is 3.33 + 6 = 9.33 liters. 

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 24 - 9.33 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: 14.67"

4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
5. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the age at which Raymond had a son from his current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs to the first 5 customers. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of 'x', which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for 'x':

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Now, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza cost $17. Each box costs $8.50, so the number of boxes is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:

60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

20 miles (first stop) - 45 miles (distance from second stop to the end) is not correct, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. 

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting 15 miles from the distance of the first stop and then subtracting that result from the total trip distance. 

However, a simpler way to find the distance between the two stops is to subtract the distance of the first stop from the total trip distance and then subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from that result. 

60 miles (total trip) - 20 miles (first stop) = 40 miles
40 miles - 15 miles (distance from second stop to the end) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the cost of the boots be B. 
One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so the other pair costs 2 * 33 = $66. 
The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 
Since the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B = 99 + 5. 
Solving for B, we get B = 104.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age now is 162, we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
= 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, then 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

He has 10 dogs and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. 

Total hours per day = 10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week.

Total hours per week = 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to get the total points: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how many yogurts he eats in 30 days. 

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the price per set to find the total cost. 

15 sets * $5.00 per set = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. So, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

Now, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set. 195 / 15 = 13. This means he sold all 13 Lego sets.

However, the question asks how many Lego sets he still has. Since he sold all 13 Lego sets, he has 0 Lego sets left."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by that time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total hours run per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Since John runs 60 miles a week and runs for 6 hours a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out Dana's walking speed first. Since she can skip at half the speed of running and she skips at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. 

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she spends walking and running. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"

"To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

Now, let's subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

So, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already eaten from your daily target. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can eat.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can eat by the total weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 300g = 240g

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add 80 and 220: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract 23 from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. 

1/4 of 120 units = (1/4) * 120 = 30 units

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week: 
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens: 
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week: 
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent going and coming back. 

First, let's find the time he spent going from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels from 1 to 4 PM, that's a 3-hour period. However, we need to find the distance he traveled and then divide it by his speed to get the time. 

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's find the time it took him to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour. Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 10 mph = 3 hours.

Since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours, and it took him 3 hours to travel that distance, he must have started at 10 AM. 

Now, let's find the time he spent going back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and his speed is 6 mph. Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

So, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (going) + 5 hours (coming back) = 8 hours.

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480

Since the revenue from car tires on Friday ($480) is higher than the revenue from both truck and car tires on Thursday ($520), we need to compare the revenue from car tires on Friday with the total revenue on Thursday.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue from car tires on Friday from the total revenue on Thursday: $520 - $480 = $40

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages of 2 flowers * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages of 3 flowers * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

Original price: $100
Discount percentage: 30%

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.3 x $100 = $30

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the two girls got, we need to multiply 1/6 by 24. 

1/6 * 24 = 4 liters per girl. 
Since there are two girls, they got 4 * 2 = 8 liters in total.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters. 
24 - 8 = 16 liters.

Then, we subtract the 6 liters the boy got from the remaining 16 liters. 
16 - 6 = 10 liters.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. 
He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.
He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.
He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we need to find their combined weights. 
Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the number of games they lost be x. 
Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. 
So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since x is the number of games they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene is 34 years old and has been vacationing since he was 23, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them up.

The first time, the alarm rang 4 times.

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first calculate her salary after 5 years of service, and then calculate her salary after 8 years of service.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

Increase after 6 years: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 6 years: $660 + $66 = $726
Increase after 7 years: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 7 years: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Increase after 8 years: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 8 years: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (total invited guests) - (1/4 of 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75.

12 (guests who will attend) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags needed) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we first need to calculate how much an adult and a child will eat. 

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and the children. 

For the adults, 20 adults will eat 20 * 10 = 200 lbs of potato salad. 
For the children, 5 children will eat 5 * 5 = 25 lbs of potato salad.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lost half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find out how many tomatoes Freda used: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
- 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The length of the inner box is 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The width of the inner box is 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).
The height of the inner box is 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the length, width, and height: 
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

- Friday: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours

Total hours watched: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, the remaining hours watched on Wednesday would be 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday would be 1.5 hours * 2 (to convert hours to minutes) / 0.5 (since each episode is 30 minutes) = 6 episodes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This means that the number of cookies he had before dropping any is 110 + 5 = 115.

So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 115.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 115 - 15
2x = 100

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 100 / 2
x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x.

We are also given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% over the four years, we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000 / 1.4 (to find the original salary, we divide by 1.4 because 100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4)

1.3x = 40000 / 1.4
1.3x = 28571.43
x = 28571.43 / 1.3
x = 22000

So Lylah's salary four years ago was $22000.

Now, we need to find their salaries four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
40000 * 1.4 = 56000

Lylah's salary increased by 40% as well, so her new salary is:
22000 * 1.4 = 30800

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:
Total distance = Distance at 10 miles per hour + Distance at 5 miles per hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jennie starts with a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. 

To find one-third of 60, we divide 60 by 3: 60 / 3 = 20. 

So, Jennie puts stamps on 20 letters. 

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie just stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters. 

To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie started, we need to subtract 20 from 30: 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them has. 

Lily has 50 friends. 
Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, let's add the number of friends Lily and Amy have together: 
50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to find the cost of each item and multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, let's find the cost of an orange. Since an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can find the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to multiply the number of patients by the average time each patient is seen. 

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150/hour, so the total cost is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

The hospital charges the patients $200/hour, so the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

$40000 - $30000 = $10000

The hospital makes $10000 in profit from these visits."
"To find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them, we need to calculate a third of 60. 

60 / 3 = 20 elves quit after children vomit on them.

Now, we subtract the elves who quit from the total number of elves. 

60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. 

40 - 10 = 30 elves left.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since his total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, the miles walked on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
= 41 - 28
= 13 miles

"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to first calculate how much he pays in a month. 

Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. 

So, the total amount Tom pays in a month is 4 * $15 = $60.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find the yearly cost.

$60 * 12 = $720.

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

The cost of the bags of chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of the cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
The total cost with the tip is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate how many questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 
35 (incomplete in the first test) + 70 (incomplete in the second test) = 105

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let the number of baby bees be x.
- Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x.
- There are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2.
- The total number of bees is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700

To solve for x, we multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 1400

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400

Divide both sides by 7: x = 200

Since the number of worker bees is 2x, we multiply x by 2: 2 * 200 = 400

The number of worker bees is 400."
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
3. So, after 12 hours, there are 30 - 15 = 15 bees that haven't returned yet.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
5. Now, we have a total of 15 (initial bees that left and haven't returned) + 60 (new bees that left) = 75 bees that haven't returned yet.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that (15) return to the hive.

So, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15.

"To find out who wins the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 440 feet per minute. 

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 10560 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet). His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. 

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. 

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 250 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 250 / 100 = 2.5 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents. 

Converting 225 cents to dollars: 225 / 100 = 2.25 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. There was 1 unicycle, so the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. 

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents. 

Converting 25 cents to dollars: 25 / 100 = 0.25 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'x'. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. 
   The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), so the remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - 2/3(x - 30).
   To simplify this, we can factor out (x - 30) from the expression: (x - 30) - 2/3(x - 30) = (1 - 2/3)(x - 30) = 1/3(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 5. 
   We can set up the equation: 1/3(x - 30) = 5.
   To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 15.
   Now, we can add 30 to both sides: x = 45.

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin

"To find the cost of the marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

Original price = $20
Increase rate = 20% of the original price = 0.20 * $20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
New price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
New price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912
New price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $41.472 = 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944
New price after 10 months = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $49.7664 = 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328
New price after 12 months = $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $59.71968 = 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943936
New price after 14 months = $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $71.663616 = 0.20 * $71.663616 = $14.3327232
New price after 16 months = $71.663616 + $14.3327232 = $85.9963392
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $85.9963392 = 0.20 * $85.9963392 = $17.19926784
New price after 18 months = $85.9963392 + $17.19926784 = $103.19560704
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $103.19560704 = 0.20 * $103.19560704 = $20.639121608
New price after 20 months = $103.19560704 + $20.639121608 = $123.834728648
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $123.834728648 = 0.20 * $123.834728648 = $24.7669457296
New price after 22 months = $123.834728648 + $24.7669457296 = $148.6016743776
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $148.6016743776 = 0.20 * $148.6016743776 = $29.72033487552
New price after 24 months = $148.6016743776 + $29.72033487552 = $178.32199925312
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $178.32199925312 = 0.20 * $178.32199925312 = $35.664399850624
New price after 26 months = $178.32199925312 + $35.664399850624 = $213.986399103744
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $213.986399103744 = 0.20 * $213.986399103744 = $42.7972798205488
New price after 28 months = $213.986399103744 + $42.7972798205488 = $256.7836789242928

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5. So, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. There are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself: 
3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
€1500 (budget) - €1323 (total cost) = €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job. 

First, let's find out how many eggs Sandra needs in total. Since she needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan and she's making 15, she needs 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 / 9 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, so we add 2 to 16. 16 + 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles from Monday to Friday. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles on the weekends.

Now, let's add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the miles he walks on the weekends. 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now we have the ages of Sally Four, Granny Red, and Sally Two. We still need to find the age of the fourth bird, but there's no information about the fourth bird's age. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds. Since we have three out of four birds' ages, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know and assume the fourth bird's age is unknown.

The total age of Sally Four, Granny Red, and Sally Two is 8 + 16 + 19 = 43 years.

Since we don't have information about the fourth bird's age, we can't calculate the total age of all four birds. However, the question seems to be asking for a numerical answer, so we'll assume the fourth bird's age is 0 (which is not possible in reality, but it's a way to provide a numerical answer).

The total age of the four birds is 43 + 0 = 43."
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt:

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to find the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Adding both times together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.
2. They made a profit of $25, so their total revenue is $25 + (costs) = $25 + ($3 + $2) * x, where x is the number of gallons they made.
3. Since the revenue per gallon is $10, the total revenue is 10x.
4. Setting up the equation: 10x = 25 + 5x
5. Subtracting 5x from both sides: 5x = 25
6. Dividing both sides by 5: x = 5
7. Since they spent $3 on lemons per gallon, the total amount spent on lemons is 3 * 5 = $15.

"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
3. He spends 1/3 on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
4. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$
5. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
6. The remaining amount after donation is: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$
7. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$: 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350$

"Let's break down the information given:

- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 an hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 an hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks together:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

"Let's break down the information given:

- Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
- She ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses by multiplying 4 and 40.

Number of red roses = 4x = 4 * 40 = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago, Jan was 28. Half of 28 is 14. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

From point 1, Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for the well-rounded team, we multiply the time per runner by the number of runners: 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. We multiply these times by the number of runners: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes.

There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. The difference is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom got 20 apples. 

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked by dividing the number of apples her mom picked by 2. 

Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked.

Total apples = 20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. 

We can set up the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r':

18r = 160 - 50
18r = 110
r = 110 / 18
r = 110 / (2 * 9)
r = 55 / 9
r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-examine the problem. We know that the total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160, and the total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 50. This means that the total number of straw pieces given to rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. We can set up the equation: 18r = 110.

Now, let's solve for 'r':

18r = 110
r = 110 / 18
r = 110 / (2 * 9)
r = 55 / 9
r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-examine the problem. We can try to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 110 to see if it can be divided by 6 to get a whole number.

The LCM of 18 and 110 is 330. 

We can set up the equation: 18r = 110. We can multiply both sides by 3 to get 54r = 330.

Now, let's solve for 'r':

54r = 330
r = 330 / 54
r = 5.55 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-examine the problem. We can try to find the LCM of 18 and 110 to see if it can be divided by 6 to get a whole number.

The LCM of 18 and 110 is 330. 

We can set up the equation: 18r = 110. We can multiply both sides by 3 to get 54r = 330. However, we can also try to find a multiple of 18 that is close to 110. 

18 * 6 = 108, which is close to 110. We can try to find the difference between 110 and 108, which is 2. 

We can set up the equation: 18r = 110. We can subtract 2 from both sides to get 18r - 2 = 108. 

Now, let's solve for 'r':

18r - 2 = 108
18r = 110
18r = 108 + 2
18r = 110
r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (approximately)

We can set up the equation: 18r = 110. We can subtract 2 from both sides to get 18r - 2 = 108. However, we can also try to find a multiple of 18 that is equal to 110. 

18 * 6 = 108, which is close to 110. We can try to find the difference between 110 and 108, which is 2. 

We can set up the equation: 18r = 110. We can add 2 to both sides to get 18r + 2 = 112. However, we can also try to find a multiple of 18 that is equal to 110.

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to first find out how many minutes he collects peaches for. Since he collects peaches for 3 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes.

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now that we know John collects peaches for 180 minutes, and he can collect 2 peaches a minute, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7 to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. 

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

After 10 years, the net change in trees is 8 * 10 = 80.

So, the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find out how many trees die, we need to calculate 30% of 130.

30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39.

So, the number of trees that die is 39.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, let's break down the events:

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos is 6 (white) + 30 (pink) = 36.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Violetta has $20 and one crayon costs $2. 

20 / 2 = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

2 * 5 = 10

Violetta can buy 10 crayons in total. 

Since she has $20 and each crayon costs $2, the total cost of the crayons will be 10 * 2 = $20.

Violetta will get $0 in change."

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens: $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"

New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 
Total amount = 2100 * 52 = 109200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total amount:
Total amount = 109200 + 5000 = 114200

"To find out the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese used in each meal and add them up.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since it's a week) and used 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total cheese used in sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets and used 3 slices per omelet (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich). So, the total cheese used in omelets is 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

For the macaroni and cheese, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add up the total cheese used: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the number of pens she initially had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

93 * 6 = 558

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five tests she has taken so far. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley has so far, we add up the scores of the five tests and subtract the lowest score.

89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367
367 - 71 = 296

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get a total score of 558. We subtract the total score she has so far from the total score she needs.

558 - 296 = 262

So, Brinley needs a score of 262 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost $20 each, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more to buy the jacket and shoes.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

She needs $60 more, but she earns $20 from babysitting, so she still needs $60 - $20 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we need to divide the remaining amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns from mowing the lawn ($4).

$40 / $4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total customers by Day 3: 500

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total customers by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total customers by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
= 500 - (100 + 150)
= 500 - 250
= 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute in total.

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We know that the initial amount of water in the big pool (2x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). So, we can set up the equation:

2x - 32 = 4y

We also know that the initial amount of water in the small pool (x) minus the water lost (32 gallons) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). So, we can set up another equation:

x - 32 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the second equation into the first equation:

2(x - 32) - 32 = 4y
2x - 64 - 32 = 4y
2x - 96 = 4y

Now, substitute x - 32 for y in the equation above:

2(x - 32) - 96 = 4(x - 32)
2x - 64 - 96 = 4x - 128
-160 = 2x - 128
32 = 2x
16 = x

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 32 = y:

16 - 32 = y
-16 = y

However, since y represents the amount of water in the small pool, it cannot be negative. This means that the initial amount of water in the small pool was not enough to last 4 minutes with a leak rate of 4 gallons/minute. This is a contradiction, and the problem as stated does not have a valid solution.

However, if we assume that the initial amount of water in the small pool was enough to last 4 minutes with a leak rate of 4 gallons/minute, then the initial amount of water in the small pool would be at least 16 gallons (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes). 

In this case, the initial amount of water in the big pool would be 2 * 16 = 32 gallons.

The total water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 32 gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool initially, the big pool lost 2/3 of its initial water, and the small pool lost 1/3 of its initial water. 

The amount of water lost from the small pool is 1/3 * 16 = 16/3 gallons.

The amount of water left in the small pool is 16 - 16/3 = 32/3 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{32}{3}}$"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

"To find the total amount Janeth will pay, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over 12 months. 

First, let's find the interest she will pay each month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. 

Since she will pay $165 a month, the remaining amount she will pay each month as interest is $200 - $165 = $35.

Now, let's find the total interest she will pay over 12 months. $35 x 12 = $420.

The total amount she will pay is the initial amount plus the interest. $2000 + $420 = $2420.

Since she will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 x 12 = $1980.

The remaining balance will be the total amount she will pay minus the initial amount. $2420 - $1980 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to know the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:

1. Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
2. Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
3. Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points, so half of that is 68 / 2 = 34. 10 more than that is 34 + 10 = 44. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so 68 + 17 = 85.

Now we know that Naomi scored 68, Yuri scored 44, and Brianna scored 85. We can add up the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna to find out how many points they scored in total. 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 251 - 197 = 54.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the given sequence of events.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.

30% of the students went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 (letters received) + 6 (letters sent) = 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages.

Since it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. 
Cost per day = 250 * 6 = $1500

She needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks. 
Total days = 4 * 5 = 20 days

Total cost before discount = 1500 * 20 = $30,000

After the movie is done, she gives a 10% discount. 
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * 30,000 = $3000

Total cost after discount = 30,000 - 3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. 
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, 
Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of the total number of students. Let's denote the total number of students as 'T'. Then, 50% of T is 27. 

We can write this as 0.5T = 27. To find T, we divide both sides by 0.5: T = 27 / 0.5 = 54.

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 54, and there are 3 classes, we can find the total number of students in each class by dividing 54 by 3: 54 / 3 = 18.

Since each class has 20 students, we can find the number of boys in the first two classes by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class. In the first class, there are 20 - 15 = 5 boys. In the second class, there are 20 - 12 = 8 boys.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13. 

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is 50% of 54, which is 0.5 * 54 = 27.

Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 27 - 13 = 14.

"Let's break down the information given:

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. 

However, we already know that the number of cougars killed today is 12, so we don't need to use x. 

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today. 

Total animals killed = (10 + 15) + (3 * 12) + 12
Total animals killed = 25 + 36 + 12
Total animals killed = 73

"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows each stall got, we divide 40 by 10: 40 / 10 = 4. 

So, each stall got 4 new cows. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Each stall has 20 original cows plus 4 new cows, which is 20 + 4 = 24 cows per stall. 

To find out how many cows are in 8 stalls, we multiply 24 by 8: 24 * 8 = 192.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by the number of cups needed per dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we can multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs: 5.5 * 2 = 11.

However, since you can't buy a fraction of a cup of flour, we can round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also calculate the total amount of flour needed for 66 cookies directly. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can calculate the total amount of flour needed for 66 cookies as follows: (66 / 12) * 2 = 11.

So Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

9,300 * 2 = 18,600 

18,600 / 3 = 6,200 

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00 

The final answer is: $62.00"

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount from the result: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000."
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent on all ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we first need to find the total number of bedrooms and then multiply it by the number of windows in each bedroom. 

There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6. 

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows between the houses. 

Total windows = 12 (in bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, the total number of stitches for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

Since the body takes 900 stitches, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the total number of lines for each scene and the song, and then add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines to memorize from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines to memorize from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add up the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards that didn't have the letter A, then subtract the number of cards with the letter B from that, and finally subtract the number of cards with the letter C from that.

First, let's find the number of cards with the letter A: 
2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Now, let's find the number of cards that didn't have the letter A: 
80 - 32 = 48 cards.

Next, let's find the number of cards with the letter B: 
1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, let's find the number of cards that didn't have the letter B: 
48 - 24 = 24 cards.

Finally, let's find the number of cards with the letter C:

"Let's break down the problem. 

Mico and Marco's current ages sum up to 20. 

Let's assume Mico's age is x and Marco's age is (20 - x), since their ages sum up to 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be (x + 10) and Marco's age will be (20 - x + 10) = (30 - x).

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (30 - x) = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Sam's current age as 'S' and Ruby's current age as 'R'. 

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second one: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. If a cobra has 70 spots, then a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we need to find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots on all the snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how many people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and their guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to find out how many beads fit into the remaining space. First, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining space by the length of each bead: 17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads.

"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

"To find the time the car in the fast lane took to cover 480 miles, we need to divide the distance by its speed. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour
Time = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's represent the total medals given out as 'x'. Then, 1/10 of x is equal to 39. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 10:
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available in total, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet. 

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars per packet = 40 chocolate bars

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets.

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars per adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children.

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get.

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. If a player has over 20 points, they get an extra point.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

"To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg per day = 14 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 14 days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last.

14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he only had 5 working days. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the target per day and multiply it by 5. 

Target per day = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Target for 5 working days = 17.14 * 5 = 85.7 (approximately)

Since Sam can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll round down to 85 crates for 5 working days.

Now, let's find out how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week. 

Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. Three other people bid once, so the desk price increases by $50 three times. 

The total increase in price is 3 * $50 = $150. 

Adding this to the initial bid, the desk price before Carmen's final bid is $200 + $150 = $350. 

Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, she makes 4 bids in total (including her initial bid). 

Each bid increases the price by $50, so the total increase in price due to Carmen's bids is 4 * $50 = $200. 

Adding this to the desk price before Carmen's final bid, the total cost of the desk is $350 + $200 = $550.

The final answer is: $550"

"To find out how much Annika spent on food and snacks, we need to calculate half of the $50 she brought. 

Half of $50 is $50 / 2 = $25.

She spent an additional $10 on rides. 

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

So, Watson made $3200 in April."

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

60 (total loaves) - 40 (morning sales) = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in one week, Joey loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

However, the question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy will need 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds (2 pounds/week * 4 weeks). 

So, the answer is 4 weeks."
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The discounted price is 2 x $11 = $22. So, the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. The discounted price is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. So, the savings from buying 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract the amount he wants to save from his initial budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000, so we need to subtract the amount he wants to save from his initial budget:
$6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent so far from the remaining budget:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we need to first find out how many eggs they consume in a day. 

There are 5 people in the family. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The rest of the people, which is 5 - 3 = 2, eat 2 eggs each day. So, the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. 

Now, we add the total number of eggs eaten by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs eaten per day by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age:

2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it's 2D.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it's D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. We can set up an equation based on this information:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract those from the total:
24 - 8 = 16 people

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2 people. So, we subtract those from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness:
8 - 2 = 6 people

Now, we subtract the total number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
16 - 6 = 10 people

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. 

The total number of people at the party is 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

So, 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. This means that 10 - 3 = 7 women left the party.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To find the number of pencils in each box, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24.

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: x = 24 / 3, x = 8.

So, each box contains 8 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 / 8 = 8.75.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's add the effect of the cream. The coffee is already 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, and then 15 milliliters of cream is added, making it 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can assume that the ratio of new records to old records is 1:2. This means that for every 1 new record, 2 old records are traded in.

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of old records traded in. Let x be the total number of old records traded in.

The ratio of new records to old records is 1:2, so the ratio of new records to total old records is 1:(2x). We know that 5 people leave with 7 new records, so the total number of new records is 7.

We can set up the proportion: 1/(2x) = 7/total old records. However, we know that the total number of old records is x, so we can simplify the proportion to 1/(2x) = 7/x.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 1*x = 7*2x. This simplifies to x = 14x. 

However, this is not correct, as it implies that x is 0. Let's re-examine the problem. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, and the ratio of new records to old records is 1:2, we can set up the proportion 1:2 = 7:x. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 1*x = 7*2. This simplifies to x = 14.

However, this is the number of new records that were traded in, not the total number of old records. Since the ratio of new records to old records is 1:2, the total number of old records is 2x. 

So, the total number of old records is 2*14 = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

- At the first bus stop, 5 people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 people got in.
- After the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop.

We can represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were 'x' people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5.
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that after the second bus stop, there were 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to their current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On their current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off their purchase. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount they got is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much they paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total income and then subtract the taxes. 

Job A's total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000. 
The state tax rate is 20%, so the taxes are $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. 
The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we first need to subtract the property tax from the total income. 
The property tax is $6,000, so the income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. 
The state tax rate is 10%, so the taxes are $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. 
The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price after the first year and then the price after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5). 
New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).
New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of all Maria's shares.
Final value = 9 * 8 = $72.

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by substituting x = 70 into the expression: 
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since there are twice as many chickens as cows). 

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: C + 2C = 60. 

Combining like terms, we get 3C = 60. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20. 

So, there are 20 cows and 2C = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. 

The total number of legs from cows is 20 * 4 = 80. 

The total number of legs from chickens is 40 * 2 = 80. 

The total number of legs from all animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

Weight of the pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of the blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of the green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of the yellow snake = 60 pounds

"To find the percentage increase, we need to first find the difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for all of them is 1 round * $5 * (x + 1) because Morgan is also playing. 

The cost of the arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of the go-karts is 2 rides * $10 * (x + 1) because Morgan is also riding the go-karts.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. 

Total cost = $5 * (x + 1) + $5 + 2 * $10 * (x + 1)
Total cost = $5x + $5 + $5 + $20x + $20
Total cost = $25x + $30

We know that the total budget is $90. So we can set up the equation:

$25x + $30 = $90

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

$25x = $90 - $30
$25x = $60

Now, we divide both sides by $25:

x = $60 / $25
x = 2.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

x = 2

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we first need to determine how much money he had left after buying the candy. 

Billy started with $10. He spent an unknown amount on candy. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x'. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x.

The amount of money Billy had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x). We can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we subtract 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Divide both sides by -1.5:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's break down the information given. Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. 

The statement ""Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son"" can be written as an equation: 2x - 5 = 45.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
This simplifies to: 2x = 50

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2: (2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
This simplifies to: x = 25

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."

Total boys = 53

Now, we need to find the number of boys present on Friday. We know that 4 boys were absent, so we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.
Boys present = Total boys - Absent boys
Boys present = 53 - 4
Boys present = 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to find the number of boys first. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, we multiply the number of girls by 2.

Number of girls: 6
Number of boys: 6 * 2 = 12

Now, we add the number of girls and boys to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total kids: 6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points. 

Total required points = 42
Points scored so far = 15 (first test) + 18 (second test) = 33

Minimum points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. 
   Four times that many minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. 
   So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence over goods on sale: 21

Total number of customers kicked out for these reasons: 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
50 - 31 = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Erin now has 14 points. Sara has 8 points. Erin has three times more points than Sara, which means Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points more than Sara. 

Since Erin has 14 points now, and she has 24 points more than Sara, we can set up an equation to find out how many points Erin had before. Let x be the number of points Erin had before. 

The equation is: x + 24 = 14 (since Erin had 24 more points than Sara, and now she has 14 points)

To find x, we need to subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 14 - 24
x = -10

However, this doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of points. This means that the initial information given is incorrect or inconsistent. 

But if we assume that the question is asking for the number of points Erin had before she scored 14 points, we can set up a new equation. Let x be the number of points Erin had before she scored 14 points. 

The equation is: x + 14 = 3 * 8 (since Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Sara has 8 points)

To find x, we need to subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 3 * 8 - 14
x = 24 - 14
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, let's calculate the cost of etching the logo on the picture frames. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of each picture frame. 20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching the logo on all the picture frames is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost. $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday, which is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"

The total amount spent is $400,000. 
40% of the total amount is faulty. 
40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

The value of the faulty pieces is $160,000. 
To find the value of the functioning pieces, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent:
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

Half of the 30 sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep. 
These 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from them is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The other half of the 30 sheep is also 15 sheep. 
These 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from them is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

First, let's add the cookies Rachel bought and the cookies Janet gave her:
23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

Now, let's subtract the cookies her brother ate:
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest Karan has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

The total interest can be calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Karan has to pay: 
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"

"To find the total number of pesos they have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos each of them has, and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have together:
Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350.

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to first find the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and each cup is sold for $1, the revenue per hour is 4 * $1 = $4.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours she spends running the stand. Since she sells all the lemonade in one hour, the profit per hour is $18 / 1 = $18.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total amount of land he had at first is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

The cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is $36, and the cost for David to ride all 9 rides is $30. 

The difference in cost is $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets for all 9 rides.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can set up the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x is 15, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus each is $10 a month. When bundled, Tim saves 20% on the total cost of the two services. 

First, let's find the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus without the discount: $10 + $10 = $20.

The discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.2 x $20 = $4.

So, the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of all the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable package.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the original energy used per day. 

Original energy used per hour = 900 watts
Original energy used per day = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts
Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, 
Original energy used per day in kilowatts = 7200 watts / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts

Now, let's find the new energy used per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours.
New energy used per hour = 900 watts
New energy used per day = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts
New energy used per day in kilowatts = 2700 watts / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts

Now, let's find the energy saved per day.
Energy saved per day = Original energy used per day - New energy used per day
Energy saved per day = 7.2 kilowatts - 2.7 kilowatts = 4.5 kilowatts

Now, let's find the total energy saved in 30 days.

2. He bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
3. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.
4. Now, Allan has a total of 80 (initial corns) + 60 (new corns) = 140 corns.
5. The total number of cannolis is 100.
6. The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
- He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

So, the total steps Elliott took before his jog would be 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total steps he took would be 10,000 (goal) - 2,000 (remaining) = 8,000 steps.

Now, to find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he took before his jog from the total steps he took: 8,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps before jog) = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Since Toby can read 300 words per minute, we can calculate the time it takes for him to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time it takes for Toby to finish the book and get to the airport is:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we subtract the total time it takes for him to finish the book and get to the airport from the time he has to be there:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can consider it as a 2-pound purchase with a discount on the second pound. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $1200 is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount Tim spent is the cost of the fireworks with the discount plus the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many cookies Shannon needs, we need to multiply the number of days she wants the cookies to last by the number of cookies she eats per day. 

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, and she wants them to last for 30 days. 

2 cookies/day * 30 days = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply 50,000 by 0.05:

50,000 * 0.05 = 2,500 candles that smell like wet dog

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a 1% chance of exploding. However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, and the remaining 95% are the ones that are more dangerous but do not smell like wet dog. So, 95% of the candles that smell like wet dog are the ones that are more dangerous but do not explode. 

To find the number of candles that are more dangerous but do not smell like wet dog, we multiply the number of candles that smell like wet dog by 0.95:

2,500 * 0.95 = 2,375 candles that are more dangerous but do not smell like wet dog

Now, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply the number of candles that are more dangerous but do not smell like wet dog by 0.05:

2,375 * 0.05 = 118.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a candle, we round down to 118.75 ≈ 119 candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog.

However, the problem states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are more dangerous and can explode. We know that 2,500 candles smell like wet dog, and 119 of them are more dangerous and smell like wet dog. To find the total number of candles that are more dangerous and can explode, we multiply the number of candles that smell like wet dog by 0.01:

2,500 * 0.01 = 25 candles that are more dangerous and can explode

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We already know that 119 candles are more dangerous and smell like wet dog. To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog that can explode. We know that 25 candles are more dangerous and can explode, and 119 candles are more dangerous and smell like wet dog. To find the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog that can explode, we divide the number of candles that are more dangerous and can explode by the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog:

25 / 119 ≈ 0.21

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 119 candles are more dangerous and smell like wet dog, and 0.21 is the proportion of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog that can explode. To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we multiply the number of candles that are more dangerous and smell like wet dog by 0.21:

119 * 0.21 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 x $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 x $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. 

We are given two pieces of information: 
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304.

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D. 

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute C into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries.

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each part of the trip and add them together.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker.
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker.

Now, let's calculate the size of Zack's locker:
Zack's locker = 4 * Peter's locker = 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches

Now, let's calculate the size of Timothy's locker:
Timothy's locker = 2 * Zack's locker = 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5: (3/5) * 30 = 18.
5. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods.

For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month. 
6 months * $8 per month = $48

For the next 8 months, the cost is $12 per month.
8 months * $12 per month = $96

After that, the price increased to $14 per month. Since 2 years is 24 months, we need to find out how many months are left after the first 14 months (6 + 8). 
24 months - 14 months = 10 months

The cost for the remaining 10 months at $14 per month is:
10 months * $14 per month = $140

Now, we add up the costs for all the periods:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x.

Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation: x = 28 - 6
x = 22

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans. This means he saved 2/3 of the savings from the tattered jeans.

Let the savings from the tattered jeans be y. Then, 2/3 of y is the savings from the jogger jeans, which is $6. We can write an equation: (2/3)y = 6
Multiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for y: y = 6 * (3/2)
y = 9

So, the savings from the tattered jeans is $9.

The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and the savings from the tattered jeans is $9. The original price of the tattered jeans is 28 + 9 = $37.

The cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $37. The difference is 37 - 22 = $15.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
- The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each day.
- The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each day.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and 3 homemade bird feeders, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type:

- Store-bought bird feeders: 3 * 20 = 60 birds
- Homemade bird feeders: 3 * 30 = 90 birds

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade bird feeders:

60 + 90 = 150

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he must have made $50 from selling cards. 

Since each card is sold for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount of money he made ($50) by the price of each card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5
Number of cards sold = 33.33

However, since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards sold.

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. We can set up an equation to find the total number of cards:

2/3 * Total number of cards = 33

To solve for the total number of cards, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total number of cards = 33 * (3/2)
Total number of cards = 49.5

Since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that he sold 33 cards and kept 1/3 of the cards, so the total number of cards must be a multiple of 3. 

Therefore, the total number of cards Kenny started with is 49."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. 

These 18 guests would have two hotdogs each, so the total number of hotdogs prepared for them would be 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests to have one hotdog each, which is a total of 36 hotdogs.

Since 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed would be 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

However, the caterer only prepared 36 + 36 = 72 hotdogs. This means that there are 80 - 72 = 8 hotdogs missing.

Since each hotdog is for one guest, the 8 missing hotdogs would be for 8 guests. However, the question asks for the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog. 

Since there are 40 guests and 8 hotdogs are missing, it means that 8 guests did not get a second hotdog because there were not enough hotdogs for them.

The final answer is: 8"

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons of gas.

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 0.75 gallons is equal to 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume George started with x dollars. Since he had 1% of his money left after buying chips, he spent 99% of his money. 

We know that 99% of x is equal to the cost of the chips and the candy bars. The cost of the chips is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20. 

So, 99% of x - 1.20 = cost of candy bars. 

We also know that George spent a total of $5. 

So, 99% of x = 5 + 1.20 = 6.20. 

Now, we can convert 99% to a decimal: 0.99x = 6.20. 

To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.99: x = 6.20 / 0.99 = 6.2626 (round to 2 decimal places). 

Since George spent $5, we can find the cost of the candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount spent: 5 - 1.20 = 3.80. 

Now, we can find the number of candy bars by dividing the cost of the candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: 3.80 / 0.75 = 5.0667 (round to 4 decimal places).

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne's 4-minute drive. So, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minute before Wayne. However, since you can't leave a negative amount of time before someone, this means Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature increase from baking and the temperature decrease from opening the window.

Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase from baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 degrees * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase from baking is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease from opening the window is 6 degrees. 

So, the final temperature is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to find out how long it took him to complete the entire triathlon. 

First, let's convert Jon's times into minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it's 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it's 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
Time for James to run: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours first. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Now, we can calculate the distance: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay will be 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money he has: 
$30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the sales to the department store.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale, so the total revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

The salesman sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to the department store for $25 each, so the total revenue from the department store is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of sneakers is $576, so the profit is:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20 and get a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, the total cost is $21. 

If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price, the total cost is $12 + (popcorn price + soda price). 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket and the snacks is $21 - $2 = $19.

We know the soda costs $3, so the popcorn price can be represented as x. The equation for the total cost of the regular ticket and snacks is 12 + x + 3 = 19.

Solving for x, we get x = 19 - 12 - 3 = 4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost per balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost per balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost per balloon was $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, making the new cost per balloon $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price:

Total cost = Number of balloons * New cost per balloon
Total cost = 170 * 65
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: $11050"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

The value of the 2 rubies she got in exchange is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the value of the sapphires she has left plus the value of the rubies she got in exchange, minus the value of the sapphires she traded. 

Total value = ($6400 - $2400) + $2400 = $6400 - $2400 + $2400 = $6400

$6400"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, so together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the total number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has and the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies that have spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds.

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds.

To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight of the feed by the weight the truck can carry: 3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans are 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Grayson's total earnings from recycling in a four-week month are 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

80 - 40 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.

24 oranges * $10/orange = $240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we need to subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed. 

Total hours = Total miles / Speed
Total hours = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is 200 / 50 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = 2/3 * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = 1/3 * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add up the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, let's add up the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30.

Now, we divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10.

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 / $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the 2 trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is 24 * 2 = 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 can fit on the trays, so the number of eggs that won't fit is 64 - 48 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 1 pack of razors after the discount is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 x 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 x 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 x 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. So, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours = 40 minutes/day.

Since she worked for 5 days, the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 now, three times that is 3 * 14 = 42.

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

To find Angela's current age, we need to subtract 4 from 42, because we know her age in four years. 

Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

The total cost is $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"Let's break down the information given:

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so to find out how many pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by 3.

120 / 3 = 40

"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). 
For the second venue, the total cost is $25x (per person charge).

To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:
200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:
10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. 

We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 2B/2 = B. So the equation becomes: 2B + B + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: 3B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3B = 36

Divide both sides by 3: B = 12

Now that we know Bodhi found 12 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 12/2 = 6

And the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by Mariah is 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by her grandma is 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 x 5 = 10.

3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 x 2 = 6.

The total number of gifts for all friends is 10 + 6 = 16.

Adding the 10 random gifts, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 16 + 10 = 26.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. 

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 
So, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 
Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 
Adding 2 feet to that makes the couch 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost is $7.

We know that the total cost is the sum of the costs of all the packs of gum. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. 

The total cost equation is: 2x (for the strawberry packs) + 2 (for the grape pack) + 1 (for the green apple pack) = 7.

Combine like terms: 2x + 3 = 7.

Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 4.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar and then calculate how many of that type of wood he can buy with his budget.

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar.
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we will calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his budget. 

He has $24, so he can buy 24 / 6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first find out how many snowshoes he needs in total. Since each dog has 4 legs and he has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost will be 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week, we need to calculate the cost of two bus trips per day for five days. 

Cost of two bus trips per day = 2 * $2.20 = $4.40
Cost of two bus trips per day for five days = $4.40 * 5 = $22.00

Now, we need to find out how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Amount saved = Cost of two bus trips per day for five days - Cost of weekly bus pass
Amount saved = $22.00 - $20.00
Amount saved = $2.00

"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120

"Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This can be represented as:

4x = 12 (onions)
4y = 4 (potatoes)

To find the values of x and y, we can solve these equations:

For onions: 4x = 12
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

For potatoes: 4y = 4
y = 4 / 4
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, Andy has 160 days to lose the weight.

To find the total calories he needs to burn, we multiply the weight he wants to lose (30 lbs) by the calories burned per pound (3500 calories). 
30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days. 
105,000 calories / 160 days = 656.25 calories per day

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let the cost of the lot be x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can multiply x by 3 to find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there might be an error in the given information. If the profit is negative, it means Tara actually lost money.

But if we assume that the question is asking for the amount of money she lost, then the answer would be:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 
   Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20) = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money. 
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. 
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

The total number of problems is 100, so the number of problems left after Monday and Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide 9 by 3/4. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. 

9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh. 

After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.

After adding the new device, Ada's weekly bill is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.
5. To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 152.

The final answer is: 152"
"Let's break down the information given. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for an unknown price. The total cost was $48. 

Let's denote the price of the headphone set as 'x'. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

4 + x = 48

To find the price of the headphone set, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the price of the headphone set is $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. If he had spent the $44 on CDs instead, he could have bought:

44 / 4 = 11 CDs

Since he could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphone set, and he could have bought 1 CD with the money he spent on the CD itself, the total number of CDs he could have bought is:

11 + 1 = 12

So, Tom could have bought 12 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (8 weeks total - 2 weeks with 5 hours). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. 
Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times 21 is 63, but since it's 3 times fewer, we subtract 63 from 21 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21 - 63 = -42. However, since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 is 3 times more than the number of passengers who got in. So, we need to divide 63 by 3 to get the number of passengers who got in, which is 21. 

Now, the total number of passengers is:
59 (left) + 21 (got in) = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years old.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years old.
4. The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer costs $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:

Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total to find the cost of the 2 monitors:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Computer cost + Printer cost)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 * 60 = 240. 

Then, we add 600 + 240 = 840.

So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 840.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, let's say George had x candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies.

Then, George ate 5 candies, so he was left with x - 5 candies.

We are given that George now has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had:

Nick had 2x candies, so Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Total vlogs Emma aims to make = 72

Vlogs needed to be made = Total vlogs aimed - Total vlogs made so far
= 72 - 54
= 18

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

2. The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so we add $5 to the initial share.

New amount after adding $5 = $6 + $5 = $11

3. The following day, he added another $10 to his share, so we add $10 to the new amount.

New amount after adding $10 = $11 + $10 = $21

4. He then spent $8 from his total, so we subtract $8 from the new amount.

Amount after spending $8 = $21 - $8 = $13

5. He saved some more and tripled the amount he had left after spending $8. To triple the amount, we multiply $13 by 3.

Final amount = $13 * 3 = $39

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half of April is 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount he saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis wants to save in April is $1125. So, the sum of the amounts he saves in the first and second half of the month is equal to his target:

xy + 2y = 1125

We can factor out y from the left side of the equation:

y(x + 2) = 1125

Since x is the number of days in the first half of April, x must be an integer between 1 and 15 (inclusive). We can try different values of x to find the one that satisfies the equation.

Let's try x = 15. Then, the number of days in the second half of April is 30 - 15 = 15.

Substituting x = 15 into the equation, we get:

y(15 + 2) = 1125
y(17) = 1125
y = 1125 / 17
y = 66.18 (approximately)

Since y must be an integer, x = 15 is not a valid solution.

Let's try x = 14. Then, the number of days in the second half of April is 30 - 14 = 16.

Substituting x = 14 into the equation, we get:

y(14 + 2) = 1125
y(16) = 1125
y = 1125 / 16
y = 70.3125

Since y must be an integer, x = 14 is not a valid solution.

Let's try x = 13. Then, the number of days in the second half of April is 30 - 13 = 17.

Substituting x = 13 into the equation, we get:

y(13 + 2) = 1125
y(15) = 1125
y = 1125 / 15
y = 75

Now we have a valid solution. The amount Elvis saves in the first half of April is $75, and the amount he saves in the second half is 2y = 2(75) = $150.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny's total earnings = 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, let's find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, we can multiply x by 4:

Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days he works: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. 

James's play set has 80 toys. A play set five times larger than James's would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: 

Let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, x + 2 = 400.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: 

x + 2 - 2 = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Twice as long as it takes him to swim a mile in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.
2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water and 3 miles in warm water.

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. 
Since the daily recommended cups of coffee is not specified, let's call it 'x'. 
So, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. 
So, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. 
So, Juan needs to reduce his current coffee intake of 5x cups to 4 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 
5x - 4.

However, we still don't know the value of 'x'. Since the problem doesn't provide a specific value for 'x', we can express the answer in terms of 'x'. But, if we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 8 (a common recommendation), then we can calculate the answer.

If the daily recommended cups of coffee is 8, then x = 8. 
So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from 5x = 5 * 8 = 40 cups to 4 cups. 
The number of cups Juan needs to reduce is 40 - 4 = 36 cups.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Now that we know there are 70 intervals of 1.5 minutes, and she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we multiply 70 by 2 to find the total pages she read in the first week. 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so the total is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   So, Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   So, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first find out how much money Mitchell made and then subtract the amount Liam made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so he made 21 x $4 = $84.

Now, we subtract the amount Liam made ($63) from the amount Mitchell made ($84) to find the difference: $84 - $63 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he has 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

He spent $70 - $20 = $50 on plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday. Since there are 3 days left, he spent $50 / $2 = 25 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures + 25 plastic action figures = 29 action figures.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will remove from the account in 2 years and subtract that from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

The total cost for 1 sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

The revenue from selling 1 sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit for 1 sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70.

The net profit for 10 sandwiches is $3.70 * 10 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to first find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find out how many small pieces of crayons there are in total. 

There are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so there are 3 x 64 = 192 small pieces of crayons. 

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, we need to divide the total number of small pieces of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

192 / 8 = 24 muffin crayons.

Now, we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons and she can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50. 

To find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon. 

24 x $1.50 = $36.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and the costs for the carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost for the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost for the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost for removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost for installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds. 
On days four and five, Mack saw 120 birds. 
On day six, Mack saw 20 birds. 
On day seven, Mack saw 90 birds.

First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw on days one and two: 50 + 50 = 100
Then, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw on days four and five: 120 + 120 = 240
Now, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw on days one, two, four, five, six, and seven: 100 + 240 + 20 + 90 = 450

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 64.2857."
"To find the final value of the number train, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find out how many cards the brother has, we need to subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has. 

The boy has 5 cards, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.
The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520.

First, we find 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8.

Then, we subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the length of each movie in minutes. 

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hour to minutes by multiplying 1 by 60, which equals 60 minutes. Adding the 30 minutes, the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes long.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the hours to minutes, 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Adding the 5 minutes, the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes long.

Now, we add the length of both movies: 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Let's break down the information given. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we need to add the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend. 

Judy brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils. 
Her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.

"To find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will need, we need to multiply the number of days he needs contacts by the number of pairs he uses per day. 

Pete needs contacts for 45 days and uses 1 pair per day, so he needs 45 pairs of contacts. 

Since he buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of 90 pairs of contacts (2 boxes * 45 pairs per box).

The discount is 10% off the original price of $100.00 per box. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00.

The discounted price per box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

To find the total cost of 2 boxes, we multiply the discounted price by 2: $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate the total hours they worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours she worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. The total hours John worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

The hourly wage is $10. Jill's total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running. 

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Total calories burned: 1600
Divide by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml of water. 

8 * 100 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
He increases his speed by 5 WPM again, so the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To find the average, we add the three measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends, so the total number of people invited by them is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 couples will be attending, which is 8 * 2 = 16 people.

Now, we add the people invited via email (including their friends), the people invited by phone (including their spouses), and Alex herself. 

Total people = 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends of the initially invited) + 16 (spouses of the friends invited by phone) + 10 (Alex's friends invited by phone) + 1 (Alex herself) = 327

However, we need to consider that Alex is also attending, so we should not count her as a separate person.

"To find the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Amazon cost = $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so the shipping cost is $4 * 2 = $8.

eBay cost = $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the Amazon cost from the eBay cost.

Difference = eBay cost - Amazon cost = $21 - $20 = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it would be 2x. 
And since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it would be 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x, which is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. 
The other angle is 3x, which is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents.

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. They both work for 12 hours a day. 

To find the total amount of chocolates they make in a day, we multiply the pounds each of them makes in an hour by the number of hours they work and add the results together.

"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the total rotations per year.

Rotations per year = 290,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 3,480,000 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years the tire will last.

Years before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 3,480,000 rotations/year = 3 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents.

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. We can subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has: $50 - $42 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 28 dozen by 12 to get the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: $194 * 490 = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street.

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Monica's street: 150 meters

Cost to repave Monica's street: $194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street to find the difference.

Difference: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. 
50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so the increased funding is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

The total cost of John's research is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so we find one-fourth of 72: 
72 * 1/4 = 18 seats occupied by administrators

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats: 
72 - 18 = 54 seats remaining

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so we find one-third of 54: 
54 * 1/3 = 18 seats occupied by parents

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by students: 
54 - 18 = 36 seats occupied by students

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. 

1 Mb = 1000 kb, so 1 kb = 1/1000 Mb. 

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb/s. To convert it to Mb/s, we divide 20 by 1000.

20 kb/s = 20 / 1000 Mb/s = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to find out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then calculate his commission on that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them:
Profit = Selling price - Cost to acquire
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

James got a 10% commission on the profit:
Commission = Profit * 0.1
Commission = $175,000 * 0.1
Commission = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends is $60. Since each class costs $10, the total cost of the classes he attends is 10 * (10 - x) = 100 - 10x.

Since the total cost of all classes is $60, we can set up the equation:

100 - 10x = 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides gives:

-10x = -40

Dividing both sides by -10 gives:

x = 4

So Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers per day:
50 customers/day * 2 = 100 customers/day

So, Julie's total weekly production is:
100 customers/day * 7 days/week = 700 customers/week

The combined total weekly production for both Jewel and Julie is:
350 customers/week (Jewel) + 700 customers/week (Julie) = 1050 customers/week

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two totals.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off because she had a voucher. So, the total cost for the first day is:
20 pomegranates * $20 each = $400
$400 - $2 (voucher) = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:
20 pomegranates * $30 each = $600
10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
$600 - $60 (discount) = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$540 (second day) - $398 (first day) = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in the first month 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats in the first month is $400, which is half of 'x', so we can write the equation as:

400 = x/2

To find the value of 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is $800.

The total sales in the first month is the sum of sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200
Sales in the second month = $900

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of sales in the first and second months:

Total amount in two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find out how much James paid, we need to calculate the total hours he used the carriage and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he got 1 hour free, so he actually used the carriage for 3 paid hours.

The first paid hour costs $15, and each hour after that costs twice the cost, which is $30.

So, the total cost is: 
- 1st hour: $15
- 2nd hour: $30
- 3rd hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received. 

First, let's find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. 

Her initial balance was $200, and her expected wage is $300. So, her expected balance should be $200 + $300 = $500.

However, her actual balance is $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the actual balance from the expected balance: $500 - $420 = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. 

1 egg = 2 deviled egg halves

Now, we need to find out how many eggs Lori needs to make 48 deviled egg halves. 

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens

"To find the total cost for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can set up the following equation for the total number of legs: 
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up the following equation: 
S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G: 
G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation: 
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation: 
4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms: 
2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides: 
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2: 
S = 15

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately and then add them together.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, a week's worth of coffee would be 7 pounds. The cost of the normal brand would be 7 * $5 = $35.

The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. A week's worth of the more expensive brand would be 7 * $6 = $42.

Since Roger can't buy his favorite brand, he has to buy the more expensive brand. The cost of the more expensive brand is $42. 

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we can calculate this as 60% of 150.

60% of 150 = 0.6 * 150 = 90 history teachers.

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60 math teachers.

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as an equation: J = 2S + 3, where J is the number of books Janey has and S is the number of books Sally has.

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can substitute J with 21 in the equation: 21 = 2S + 3.

Now, we need to solve for S. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 21 - 3 = 2S + 3 - 3, which simplifies to 18 = 2S.

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate S: 18 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 9 = S.

So, Sally has 9 books.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. When there are 8 more dogs, he needs 8 more toys. Now, he has a total of 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.

When he comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. Since he already had 12 dogs, now he has 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, he needs 28 more toys.

However, when he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. To find the total number of toys he needs, we subtract the 3 toys he no longer needs from the 28 toys he needed for the 28 dogs: 28 - 3 = 25.

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t = 44. 

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so T = t + 7.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the first equation, we get 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combine like terms, 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides, 3t = 30.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits in it. 

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, let's find the cost of one orange. Since one orange costs three times as much as a banana, and one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate. 
- 5 bananas cost 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples cost 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges cost 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the fruits in one crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to find the total number of squares and multiply it by 1 square foot per square.

The comforter has 14 red squares. 
It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

The total number of squares is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.
Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has, we need to multiply the number of high chairs by 5. 

Number of high chairs: 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Total number of chairs needed for adults and babies: 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Since the babies will be seated in high chairs, we only need to consider the adults for regular chairs. 
Number of regular chairs needed for adults: 42

Number of regular chairs available: 40
Number of regular chairs needed: 42
Number of regular chairs needed to be added: 42 - 40 = 2

The restaurant needs 2 more regular chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. 

50 percent of the deer are bucks, so the number of bucks is 50% of 50, which is 0.5 * 50 = 25 bucks.

Next, we need to find 20 percent of the bucks that are 8 points. 20 percent of 25 is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

So, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   To find Betty's points, we need to calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   30% of 50 = 0.3 * 50 = 15
   Betty's points = Adam's points + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   Tom's points = Betty's points - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   Marta's points = 3 * Tom's points = 3 * 35 = 105

Now, let's add up the points of all the students:
Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Marta's points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
400 - 255 = 145

The final answer is: 145"
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to start with the number of great grand-babies each grandchild has, which is 3, and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren Great Grandma Jones has, which is 3.

"To find out how much Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account. 50% of her paycheck is $2400 * 0.5 = $1200.

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment. 20% of her paycheck is $2400 * 0.2 = $480.

Now, let's subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the car payment from her total paycheck. $2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find out how many fireworks the city will set off in total. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks the city will set off is 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. 40% of 300 is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks she will set off is 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of fireworks Hannah will see is the sum of the fireworks she sees from the city and the ones she sets off in her backyard. So, 120 + 15 = 135.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that there are 8 males and 6 females, so the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and since there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The total number of males is 8, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"

"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise in total, we need to first find out how much they need to raise per hour. 

The amount they need to raise per hour is the total goal divided by the number of hours they have already raised money. 

Total goal: $6300
Amount raised in 3 hours: $2100

Amount raised per hour = Total goal / Number of hours = $6300 / 3 = $2100 / 3 = $700

Now, we need to find out how many hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal. 

Total goal: $6300
Amount raised per hour: $700

Number of hours = Total goal / Amount raised per hour = $6300 / $700 = 9

So, they have to fundraise for 9 hours in total to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage used for industrial purposes and subtract it from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find 80% of 40%: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

This means 32% of the river's water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Now, subtract this from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:
40% - 32% = 8%

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total quarts of each type of ice cream made in 48 hours:

Chocolate: 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla: 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:

2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"

"To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to first calculate the total cost of the ice cream. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and Erin has $6.00, we can divide the amount of money she has by the cost of each scoop to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

However, since the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 free,"" we need to consider the total number of scoops she can buy with the money, not just the number of scoops she pays for. 

Let's assume Erin buys 2 scoops for $3.00 (2 x $1.50 = $3.00), and then she gets 1 scoop free. This way, she can buy 3 scoops for $3.00. 

Now, let's calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with $6.00. 

$6.00 / $3.00 = 2

So, Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which is a total of 6 scoops."
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find out how many slices they ate in total. Since there are 5 people in total, and 2 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

2/3 * 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 2/3 * 60 = 40 slices

Now, let's find out how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is 2 pizzas in total. 

3/4 * 2 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 3/4 * 24 = 18 slices

Now, let's add the slices eaten by both groups of friends:

40 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas in total, with 12 slices per pizza, the total number of slices is:

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation: 

Length of Topher's shoe = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Substituting the length of Topher's shoe (100 inches) into the equation, we get:

100 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Now, we can solve for the length of Bobby's shoe by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

90 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to isolate the length of Bobby's shoe:

Length of Bobby's shoe = 90 / 9
Length of Bobby's shoe = 10

Let's say the number of students in each class is x. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We are given that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class.

Now, we are given that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%):

Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40

Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

Therefore, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to first find out how much they will pay per month. 

The electricity bill is $100 per month. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the total bill by 4 to find out the share of each roommate per month.

$100 / 4 = $25 per month per roommate

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the yearly share.

$25 * 12 = $300 per year per roommate

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items he sent.

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff sent:

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

So, the number of glasses Jeff has now is: 96 - 10 = 86
The number of plates Jeff has now is: 48 - 6 = 42

The total number of glasses Jeff has now is 86, and the total number of plates Jeff has now is 42.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 20 large buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers

Since large buttons are worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons: 
20 large buttons * 3 = 60 small buttons

Now, let's add up all the small buttons: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from converting large buttons

Total small buttons = 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons

Total buttons = 147 small buttons

The final answer is: 147"

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the total number of matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let x be the number of votes against the new regulation. 
Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 
The total number of votes is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation. 
So, we can write the equation: x + 2x = 33. 
Combine like terms: 3x = 33. 
Divide both sides by 3: x = 11. 
Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x, which is 2 * 11 = 22.

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we know there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can use point 1 to find the total number of puppies. Since two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the allowance from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, we can find the number of cases the third house needs, which is x = 100 cases.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read, and then add the 150 more books Ezra decided to read.

Total books read by Ezra and Ahmed = 300 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 450
Total books read by Ezra = 450 + 150 = 600

So, altogether, they have read 450 + 600 = 1050 books.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked is 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for the hours worked is 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday is $30.

Now, let's add the total earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling eggplants is 20 x 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already has $60 from selling eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from selling them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has for the weekend, we add the hours on Saturday and Sunday. 
Total time = 7 hours + 5 hours = 12 hours.

Since Tatiana reads for 3 hours, we subtract this from the total time to find the remaining time. 
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours.

Tatiana plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. 
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time to find the time spent playing soccer. 
Time spent playing soccer = Total time - (Time spent reading + Time spent playing video games) 
= 12 hours - (3 hours + 3 hours) 
= 12 hours - 6 hours 
= 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100. 
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time) * 100 
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 
= 0.5 * 100 
= 50%.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25. So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. 

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 25 * 0.6 = 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph. So, the time it takes to drive to the museum is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total driving time is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time he spends at the museum (6 hours), the total time Jack is gone from home is:

Total time = Driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles separately, and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels for the cars is 4 * 57 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels for the motorcycles is 2 * 73 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels for the cars and the motorcycles together: 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276.

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we multiply 600 by 1/3:
600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can buy the series for $6, the cost of the series is $6.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies remaining

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add the cost of the series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$6 + $800 + $2400 = $3206

The final answer is: $3206"

"To find the distance, we first need to find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drove. 

Half of 50 miles per hour is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 
5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. To find the distance they hiked, we multiply the speed by the time: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

They drove for 4.5 hours (6 - 1.5 = 4.5) at 50 miles per hour. To find the distance they drove, we multiply the speed by the time: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so if Emma jumps on x enemies, Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so if Emma collects y berries, Ava collects y + 3 berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so if Emma finishes the level in z seconds, Ava finishes in z + 4 seconds.

The score for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Score = (points for enemies) + (points for berries) + (points for time)
- Emma's score = 10x + 5y + 30z
- Ava's score = 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z + 4)

Simplifying Ava's score:
- Ava's score = 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z + 120
- Ava's score = 10x + 5y + 30z + 195

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
- Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
- Difference = (10x + 5y + 30z + 195) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
- Difference = 195

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, we can subtract the cost of the two pizzas that we already know to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week. 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pet store tank was 17, and this includes both white and orange fish. Since Bob bought all the fish from the tank, the total number of fish he bought is 17.

The total number of fish in Bob's pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (bought fish) = 24.

We know that the number of orange fish in the pond is 3 (initial) + 2x (bought), and the number of white fish is 4 (initial) + x (bought). The total number of fish in the pond is 24, so we can set up the equation:

3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24

Combine like terms:

3 + 4 + 2x + x = 24
7 + 3x = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3
x = 5.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't buy a fraction of a fish. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of white fish he bought, and the question does not specify that we must round down. Therefore, we will keep the decimal value.

However, since the question asks for the number of white fish he bought, we need to round down to the nearest whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a fish. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week. Since Andy drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. 

The total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the total gallons of gas consumed per week. We can do this by dividing the total miles driven per week by the fuel efficiency:

50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of gas per week by multiplying the gallons of gas consumed per week by the price of gas:

5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent from the quarters. Since she was given 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:

140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent from the twenties. Since she was given 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20, we can multiply the number of twenties by the value of each twenty:

10 twenties * $20 = $200

However, she only spent 3/5 of the twenties, so we need to multiply the total amount by 3/5:

(3/5) * $200 = $120

Now, let's add the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties:

$35 + $120 = $155

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than the day, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides. 

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells. 

First, we find the number of groups: 
Total people = 90
People per group = 9
Number of groups = Total people / People per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells:
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells:
Seashells per group = 2
Total seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Seashells per group
Total seashells = 6 * 2
Total seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the people who got off and add the people who got on.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172: 172 - 47 = 125.

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125: 125 + 13 = 138.

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138: 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply that by the number of days in the month.

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25
Number of days in the month: 30

First, multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the value of each bottle cap: 
10 * $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Then, multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month:
$2.50 * 30 = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discount amount and the final price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40. 
The discount is 25% of $40, which is 0.25 x $40 = $10.

So, the discount amount is $10. 
The final price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Mike pays with a $50 bill. 
To find out how much money he will have left over, we need to subtract the final price of the jeans from the $50 bill: $50 - $30 = $20.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

Time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 150 seconds
Time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds
Total time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total caroling time = Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" + Total time for ""Jingle Bells""
Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds
Total caroling time = 540 seconds

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial pay rate is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new pay rate $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final pay rate $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $10 per hour + 18 hours * $10.50 per hour + 2 hours * $11.50 per hour
= 200 + 189 + 23
= 412 dollars

Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour
= 210 dollars

The difference in their earnings is 412 - 210 = 202 dollars.

"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees = 1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 4.2 stuffed goats, but we'll round up to 5 stuffed goats to make sure the percentage is at least 30%.

So, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. So, the hours she still needs to play is 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will have traveled:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car passed the first car, the distance between them will be the difference in the distances they've traveled:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 400 passed (not 100, since the question states 400 fifth graders)

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school:

Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460
Total students in the school = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students in the school and multiplying by 100:

Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. 

Each bag holds 72 chips, so 2 bags will hold 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch of the mosaic. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, and it's a rectangle, we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height. 

Length = Total square inches / Height
Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches
Length = 4 inches

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea left, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons."
"Dale initially had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means he must have sold more than he had. 

Let's recalculate: Dale initially had 100 candies. He sold 150, but he only had 100, so he must have sold 100 of the 150 he sold from the new order of 100. This means he sold 100 candies from the new order. 

Now, Dale has 100 candies left from the initial order and 100 - 100 = 0 candies from the new order. So, he has 100 candies left in total. 

Dale needs to sell 100 candies to sell all of his candy.

"Let's break it down step by step:

- At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus.
- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

Total marshmallows used: 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped: 3
Total marshmallows lost: 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left: 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are 2 kids, we can divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have.

14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then multiply it by the cost per minute. 

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 
Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1/20 dollars. 
So, Jack's cost is 240 * (1/20) = 12 dollars.

Two of Jack's friends play for half as long as Jack, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. 
Their cost is 120 * (1/20) = 6 dollars each. 
Since there are two friends, their total cost is 2 * 6 = 12 dollars.

The other friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. 
Their cost is 360 * (1/20) = 18 dollars.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of all friends, which is 12 + 12 + 18 = 42 dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z. Since the amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of salt is 2Z. Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also 2Z.

The total amount of the ingredients (excluding oil) is Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z = 6Z.

Since the total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, the amount of oil can be found by subtracting the total amount of the other ingredients from 10 ounces. 

10 = 6Z + oil
oil = 10 - 6Z

Since the amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt, the amount of oil is 2 * 2Z = 4Z.

10 = 6Z + 4Z
10 = 10Z
Z = 1

Now that we know Z, we can find the amount of oil:
oil = 4Z
oil = 4 * 1
oil = 4

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of cars Joe gave away or sold. He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars, so in total, he gave away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away or sold from the initial number of cars he had. So, 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 
12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were already there (70) plus the number of cars that arrived during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had left, 1/2 of the cars that were there initially (50) had left, and 1/2 of the 20 cars that arrived during the first break had left. 

1/2 of 50 is 25, and 1/2 of 20 is 10. So, 25 + 10 = 35 cars had left. This means that 35 cars that were there initially and 10 cars that arrived during the first break had left. 

The number of cars that arrived during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35. 

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35 (cars that were already there) + 35 (cars that arrived during the lunch break) = 70.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has additional items to be installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's find out how many additional items Angela has in total: 6 (mirrors) + 2 (chandeliers) + 20 (pictures) = 28 items.

The cost of the initial installation is $129.00. The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item, so the total cost of the additional items is 28 * $15.00 = $420.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $420.00 = $549.00.

The total cost for Angela will be $549.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay, Kagiyami, and Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance he covered in the first 4 hours and the distance he covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Kora made 20 dishes.
- Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
- Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

- Erika has some savings in her purse, let's call it x.
- She earned $150 from her part-time job.
- Her mom gave her $80.

After receiving the $150 and $80, Erika has a total of $150 + $80 = $230. Since she now only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, she must have had some savings initially to reach a total of $230 + $50 = $280.

So, the amount of money Erika had in her purse initially is $280 - $230 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he made. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam made 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam ate 15 slices, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices he made: 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. 

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5 to find out how many cows are needed. 

25 / 5 = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from 5 to find out how many more cows he needs.

5 - 3 = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the used length of each glue stick and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 of the original length. 
5/6 of 12 millimeters is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used length is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the original length. 
1/3 of 12 millimeters is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 of the original length. 
1/2 of 12 millimeters is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add up the used lengths of the three glue sticks: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 - 20 = -8 millimeters. However, since a glue stick cannot have a negative length, this is an error in the calculation. The error is due to the fact that the used lengths of the glue sticks are more than the original length of the glue sticks. 

However, if we re-evaluate the problem, we can see that the total used length of the glue sticks is 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters. Since the total length of the three glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, but we don't know the number of socks Jack has yet.
3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, which means Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, we know Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes. Peter has 30 dishes and an unknown number of socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks.
The total number of dishes is 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8
- Students good at both math and English: unknown (let's call this x)

Since the total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both, we can set up the equation:

5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Combine the constants:
13 + x = 20

Subtract 13 from both sides:
x = 7

This means 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students good at math only and the students good at both:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

So, 12 students are good at math.

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

The total time for each group is 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = 10 minutes.

The total time available for performances is the total concert time minus the intermission time. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. The intermission is 10 minutes. So, the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Substituting the first equation into this, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Substituting the second equation into this, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85

Now, let's calculate 7/13 of the remaining pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the number of pieces he ate each day.
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda, we need to divide the total cost of 7 bottles of soda by 7 and then multiply by 3. 

Cost of 1 bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

To find the cost of 2 bottles of water, we need to divide the total cost of 4 bottles of water by 4 and then multiply by 2.

Cost of 1 bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water to find the total cost.

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bolts:
16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to first find out her hourly rate. 

Her hourly rate can be calculated by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3). 

Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can multiply it by the number of hours she will work (12) to find out how much she will earn.

Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. He lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 80 / 4 = 20.
4. So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80: 80 - 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she gets 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she gets 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly. 
Since each question is worth 5 points, she gets 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question together: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias made from selling the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens he sold. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he sold 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he made is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, we are asked to find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for. To do this, we need to subtract the profit from the total amount of money he made:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000."
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

32 glasses / 2 = 16 glasses

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we need to find the difference between the number of glasses Julie sold and the number of glasses Micah sold.

14 (Julie's glasses) - 16 (Micah's glasses) = -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of glasses, this means that Micah actually sold more glasses than Julie. 

The correct calculation should be:
16 (Micah's glasses) - 14 (Julie's glasses) = 2

So, Micah sold 2 more glasses than Julie.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first.

Let's start with the cost of the manicure. Since Iris spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, and she spent $400 on her hair, the cost of the manicure is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

Now, let's find the cost of the pedicure. Since Iris spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, and the manicure cost $100, the cost of the pedicure is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we can add up the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure to find the total amount Iris spent at the spa: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to first calculate how much money she will make from selling the rope. 

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount she will make is 20 * $2 = $40.

Next, we need to calculate how much the new rope will cost. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and it's also 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah made from selling the old rope to find out how much she will have left over. $40 - $30 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number 'x'. So, her age after 'x' years will be 8 + x.

We are told that her age after 'x' years will be thrice her present age, which is 8. So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8 + x = 24.

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 24 - 8.

x = 16.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2, a pack of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. The total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. The total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $24 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $72.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $72 = -$7.

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $7."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the runtime of Elaina's usual concert be x minutes. 

The final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, so its runtime is 2x minutes. 

At the end of the concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. 

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore. 

So, we can write the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then multiply the number made on Friday by 2.

Number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday: 125 + 125 = 250
Number of chimichangas made on Friday: 125 * 2 = 250
Total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 250 + 250 = 500

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds in the bushes.

Then, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so 2/3rd of the number of birds flying overhead is 4. This means there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply 3 by 8, which is 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of jars.

Total cookies = 55

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. 
100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants. 
75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up an equation to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. We know that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"Let's break down the information given. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. 

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2: $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. She made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn.
3. The number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is three times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.
4. The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is five times the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.

Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

Since we know she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and she made an equal amount from each lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + lemonade sales = 80.

We also know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, so we can substitute 6 for 6x in the equation: 54x + lemonade sales = 80. Since 6x = 6, x = 1.

Now we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + lemonade sales = 80 to find the amount she made from lemonade sales: 54(1) + lemonade sales = 80. 54 + lemonade sales = 80. 

Subtract 54 from both sides: lemonade sales = 26.

"Let's break down the information given. Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. We know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. 

Let's represent the number of notebooks Martha had initially as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has x + 5 notebooks.

We are also given that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. This means that x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 7 - 5, x = 2.

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had: Joseph had 3x = 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after dinner. 

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating dinner, that's a total of 3 adults and 2 children, which equals 5 people. 

Each adult can eat one bowl, so the adults will eat 3 bowls. Each child can also eat one bowl, so the children will eat 2 bowls. 

In total, 3 + 2 = 5 bowls will be eaten for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since 5 bowls were eaten for dinner, we need to find out how many bowls the pot can fill in terms of child's bowls. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child's bowls, we can say that 1 adult bowl equals 2 child's bowls. 

So, 5 bowls (eaten for dinner) in terms of child's bowls is 5 * 2 = 10 child's bowls. 

Since there are 8 child's bowls in the pot, and 10 child's bowls were eaten for dinner, there are 8 - 10 = -2 child's bowls left.

Since there are 8 child's bowls in the pot, and 10 child's bowls were eaten for dinner, there are actually 8 - 10 = -2 child's bowls left, but since we can't have a negative number of bowls, this means that there are actually 0 child's bowls left.

However, this is not the case, since we know that there are leftover bowls. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

"To find out how much William spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 1 ballpen at $0.5 is $0.5.

Now, let's add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks.
- Total material required for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material required for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the total number of tickets she bought. 

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, she bought a total of 9 * 3 = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent is $216.

So, the average price per ticket is 216 / 27 = 8.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left in his day.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
14 - 8 - 1 = 5

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 is 9 / 3 = 3.

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Now, let's find out how many blue and red shoeboxes are left. 

Blue shoeboxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

So, there are 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left in Tim's box.

"To find out how many books Joseph had initially, we need to multiply the number of books Sarah has by 2. 

Sarah has 9 books, so Joseph had 9 * 2 = 18 books initially.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. 1/5 of 30 is 30 / 5 = 6. 

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Dean started with 30 marbles. After giving away 16, he has 30 - 16 = 14 marbles left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: 
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
(60 - 8) = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, let's solve for x:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's age four years ago was 30. 

Now, let's find Adam's current age:
Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 30 + 4
Adam's current age = 34

Finally, let's find Adam's age in 8 years:
Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 34 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 42

"To find the total acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and add 100 to it. 

Twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in an hour and then multiply that by the number of hours he works and his hourly wage.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he would complete 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to half hours. 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 30 = 6 half hours.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 6 half hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Total bologna thrown = 58
- Number of red balloons = 20

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the total bologna thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at yellow balloons. 
Total bologna thrown at yellow balloons = Total bologna thrown - Total bologna thrown at red balloons
= 58 - 40
= 18

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount of money they spent is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since they spent $31 in total, and they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received. 

$31 / 2 = $15.50

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit Kira bought in total, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

14 - 2 = 12

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice that number playing volleyball, there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56.

The total revenue is the price per lollipop * total number of lollipops sold, which is $0.8 * 300 = $240.

The total cost is the cost per lollipop * total number of lollipops, which is $0.5 * 300 = $150.

The total profit is the total revenue - total cost, which is $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. So, the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5. 

However, if there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. This leaves 27 - 12 - 12 = 3 cups of tea for the cinnamon tea, which is not enough to make 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

"To find out how much water is in the tank initially, we need to calculate half of the water in the pool. 

10000 gallons (pool water) / 2 = 5000 gallons (water in the tank)

Now, we need to find out how much water is used in 6 days. 

500 gallons per day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the used water from the initial amount of water in the tank.

5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to first calculate how much money he has left. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days. 

Money left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7. He can see 1 more movie on an other day with the remaining money.

Total movies he can see: 5 (already seen on Fridays/Saturdays) + 8 (already seen on other days) + 1 (new movie on a Friday) + 1 (new movie on an other day) = 15

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 
Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. 
Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 
We are also given that P = Pp + J. 
We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had a total of 1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table and subtract the number of tables they already have.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables needed in total
30 tables needed - 15 tables already owned = 15 tables needed

So, they need 15 new tables.

Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

Total number of seeds spat = 40 seeds + 35 seeds = 75 seeds

Average total distance spat = Total distance spat by both / Total number of seeds spat
= 820 feet / 75 seeds
= 10.93 feet (rounded to two decimal places)

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day). 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), Cameron would pay 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. 

So, the total cost with the 12-hour option plus additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The difference between the two options is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos."

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of 5 * $40 = $200 from selling them.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the money he made from the price after discount.

"To find the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swam before resting.
Distance swam = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it took James to swim the first 12 miles.
Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James rested on the island.
Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance to be swum.
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Step 5: Calculate the new speed after James finishes resting.
New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, which gives us (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20, which gives us B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We know that B = D + 10 and B = A + 20. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20, which gives us D + 10 = A + 20. 

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get D = A + 10. 

Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10, which gives us A = (A + 10) - 10. 

This simplifies to A = A. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation 2D + A + 10 = 45, which gives us 2(A + 10) + A + 10 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3A + 30 = 45. 

We can subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5. 

The answer is 5."

Since there are 100 pages to the inch, and each page is printed on both sides, we have 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 200 * 1.5 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of minutes is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, let's find the total number of reports he stapled:
Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes he worked by the number of reports he staples per minute:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept for 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier from her usual sleep time: 480 - 23 - 25 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: 432"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons he has in relation to the measuring cups. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Two dozen cups = 2 x 12 = 24 cups
Measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has:
16 - 6 = 10 spoons

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. We already know he has 24 cups and 10 spoons.

Total number of utensils = 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. 

So, the hospital has 100 occupied beds initially. 

Since the hospital has 1000 beds in total, the number of unoccupied beds initially is 1000 - 100 = 900.

Now, let's calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days. 

50 patients are admitted each day, so in 14 days, 50 * 14 = 700 patients are admitted.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 100 (initially occupied) + 700 (admitted) = 800.

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 1000 (total capacity) - 800 (occupied beds) = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. So, 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20. 

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 100 - 20 = 80% of the number Courtney reported.

Since Courtney reported 48 people, 80% of 48 is 0.8 * 48 = 38.4.

However, the number of people cannot be a fraction, so we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, we need to add the holes dug each day and subtract the two holes filled in. 

Day 1: 10 holes
Day 2: 13 holes
Day 3: 8 holes
Total holes before filling in: 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes
Holes filled in: 2 holes
Total holes at the end of the third day: 31 - 2 = 29 holes

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can find the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day by multiplying the total holes at the end of the third day by 4.

Total holes at the end of the fourth day: 29 * 4 = 116 holes

The total number of holes at the end of the third day was 29, and the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day. To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total holes at the end of the third day from the total holes at the end of the fourth day.

Holes dug on the fourth day: 116 - 29 = 87 holes

The final answer is: 87"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

We also know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the amount each person got. 

Let's denote the total number of corn chips as 'x'. We can set up the equation: 

x = 70 + 70 + 85

Combine the constants on the right side of the equation: 
x = 225

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 
50% of $400 is 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into the simplified equation: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

If there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, then the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird is flying south, this distance is added to the total southerly distance:
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can add 7 to 13 to find the number of players in Zeke's team.

13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20

Now that we know Zeke's team has 20 players, we can add the number of players in both teams to find the total.

13 (Carlton's players) + 20 (Zeke's players) = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

In this case, the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of slats needed.

Total slats = Perimeter * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the ones she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many oranges that is, we need to divide the total number of oranges by 4. 240 / 4 = 60. So, she kept 60 oranges.

Now, to find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the ones she kept and gave away from the total. 240 - 60 - 80 = 100.

The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we need to find half of 50 first. 
Half of 50 is 25.

Now, we add 4 to 25 to find the number of states in India.
25 + 4 = 29

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together.

"Let's break down the information given:

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 11 boxes * $15 = $165
Total earnings on Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90

"Let's break down the information given. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 2 * 24 = 48 years old.

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother at that time, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we know that Emil is 19 years old now. So, his dad's age now is 48 - 19 = 29 years old, and his brother's age now is 12 - 19 = -7 years old. However, since age cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the information.

Let's re-evaluate the information. If Emil is 19 now, and he will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, then his dad's age at that time will be 2 * 24 = 48 years old. This means his dad's age now is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother at that time, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we know that Emil is 19 years old now. So, his dad's age now is 43 - 5 = 38 years old, and his brother's age now is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 38 + 7 = 45."

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract the space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed. 

First, let's convert 1.5 feet to inches: 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

Now, let's subtract the space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed: 1332 - (18 * (number of plants + 1)).

However, we don't know the number of plants yet. We know Pat already owns 17 flowers, and we need to find out how many more she needs to buy. 

Let's assume the number of plants is x. Then, the total length of the flower bed will be equal to the sum of the length of the plants and the space between them: 12x + 18x.

We know that the total length of the flower bed is 1332 inches, so we can set up the equation: 12x + 18x = 1332.

Combine like terms: 30x = 1332.

Now, divide both sides by 30: x = 1332 / 30 = 44.4.

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants (because Pat can't fit 44.4 plants in her flower bed).

Now that we know Pat needs 44 plants in total, and she already owns 17, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 27 * 6 = $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 / 1 = 3 roses.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 x $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find out how many sets of 30 shrimp she needs to cook. 

90 / 30 = 3

Since it takes her 10 minutes to cook one set of 30 shrimp, we can multiply the number of sets by the cooking time. 

3 * 10 = 30 minutes

However, this is the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, but we also need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp. 

So, the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect in 2 hours is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is the sum of the cooling effects minus the warming effect: 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, Bill saw the comet when he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Now, we need to find out how long it took for the comet to orbit the sun again, which is 75 years. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 75 years from the age at which he saw the comet for the second time. 

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time = 90 years old
Time taken for the comet to orbit the sun = 75 years

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 90 - 75 = 15 years old

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the number of flights to France, we first need to find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, in total, Adam received $6 from his mother and $12 from his father, which is $6 + $12 = $18. 

Adam bought the trousers for $30, and he received $18 from his parents. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Since the total age of the children is 20, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all children, which is A + A + A + 2A = 4A. We know that this is equal to 20.

So, 4A = 20. 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get A = 5.

Now that we know the average age of the group is 5, we can find Helene's age, which is 2A = 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will donate based on. 

The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to first find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, the number of people in the church is 750 / 15 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 6x, where x is a constant. 

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, let's say each kid gets 1 slice and each adult gets 2 slices. 

The total number of slices given to the kids is 4 * 1 = 4 slices. 
The total number of slices given to the adults is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

The total number of slices given out is 4 + 4 = 8 slices. 

Since the total number of slices is 6x, we can set up the equation 6x = 8. 

Solving for x, we get x = 8 / 6 = 4/3.

Now, the total number of slices is 6 * (4/3) = 8.

The number of slices each adult gets is 2, so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2/8) * 100 = 25%."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds:
- Time spent on rounds = Number of inpatients * Time per inpatient
= 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient
= 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on rounds to hours:
- Time spent on rounds (in hours) = 180 minutes / 60
= 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Time spent on appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
= 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment
= 300 minutes

Converting the time spent on appointments to hours:
- Time spent on appointments (in hours) = 300 minutes / 60
= 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
= 3 hours + 5 hours
= 8 hours

Finally, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours worked to find the time left for updating records:
- Time left for updating records = Total hours worked - Total time spent
= 9 hours - 8 hours
= 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time she wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is 8."
"Let's break down the information given. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, and together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 

First, let's add the number of boxes they sold: 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars in total and they sold 8 boxes, we can find the number of chocolate bars in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes: 64 / 8 = 8.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it's rented 3 x 4 = 12 days in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 x 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and the studio is rented 12 times a month, so the total cost of renting the studio per month is $40 x 12 = $480.

The total cost of students per session is $15, and the studio is rented 12 times a month, so the total cost of students per month is $15 x 12 = $180.

The total earnings of the dance studio per month is the total cost of renting the studio plus the total cost of students, which is $480 + $180 = $660.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $660."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. We are given that this total is 64, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'. Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7y. We are given that this total is 56, so we can write the equation:

7y = 56

To find the value of 'y', we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes, we can find the difference:

Difference = x - y
= 16 - 8
= 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we need to multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run. 

Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. 

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is x - 5 * 9 = x - 45%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining money:
Plums cost $0.25 each, so the number of plums he can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, 1 pack has 60 pieces. 

1.3 packs = 1 pack + 0.3 packs. 
1 pack has 60 pieces, so 0.3 packs have 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

So, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is L and the number of small stuffed animals sold is S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, and the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. We can set up the equation:

(Large stuffed animal price * Number of large stuffed animals) + (Small stuffed animal price * Number of small stuffed animals) = Total amount earned
($12 * L) + ($4 * S) = $120

Since S = 2L, we can substitute S with 2L in the equation:
($12 * L) + ($4 * 2L) = $120

Combine like terms:
($12 * L) + ($8 * L) = $120
($20 * L) = $120

Divide both sides by $20:
L = $120 / $20
L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:
S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 pounds by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 pounds by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set.

First, let's calculate the amount Tom paid from his old bedroom: $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find 10% of the remaining amount: 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability that he will have to turn in his homework.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 102% = -2%. However, since a probability cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem by finding the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework. 

The probability that the substitute teacher collects the homework is 50%. The probability that the normal teacher collects the homework and doesn't give an extension is 60% (100% - 40%). The probability that the normal teacher collects the homework, doesn't give an extension, and Marcus can't convince her that his dog ate his assignment is 60% * 80% (100% - 20%) = 48%.

The total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios: 50% + 48% = 98%. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to first find out how many seats are available for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats available for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive. 

Number of graduates: 950
Seats available for guests: 4750
Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, so we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans.

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean. Then, 3x is the number of small beans equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean. Since 150 medium-sized beans is equivalent to eating 150 * 3 small beans, we can set up the equation:

150 * 3 = x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 150 * 3 / 3
x = 150

So, 1 medium-sized bean is equivalent to 150 small beans. Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, he can eat 150 * 150 small beans.

The final answer is: 22500"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses = 45 - 9 = $36.

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: Hourly earnings = Net earnings / Total hours worked = 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils, then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.

The total amount spent is 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

The final answer is: 66"
"To find the total number of seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find the total number of soda bottles he will place and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find the total number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. 

Total number of bottles = Total width of the driveway / Distance between each bottle
Total number of bottles = 24 / 3
Total number of bottles = 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to go to 7 more bottles (8 total bottles - 1 for the starting point). 

Time to go from one bottle to the next = 5 seconds
Total time = Time to go from one bottle to the next * (Total number of bottles - 1)
Total time = 5 * 7
Total time = 35

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from that amount, we get:
$50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length times width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he needs a total of 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) - $11 (second race) = $10.50.

There were 3 races. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and isolate x. Multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms again: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

In 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

In 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

In 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,851.68."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, so that's 10% of 50, which is 0.1 x 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we add the number of English and German books to find the total number of non-Spanish books: 25 + 5 = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, which is a total of 4 sheets at a time.

Now, we can divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets he can wash at a time: 5 sheets / 4 sheets per load = 1.25 loads. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Greg does 2 loads of laundry per week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time they took to make the meal is the sum of their individual times, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is Donovan's time, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 x 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest. 

The rest of the emails are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. 

In a 5-day work week, James gets 80 x 5 = 400 emails.

Since 20% of these emails don't require a response, we already calculated that 16 emails don't require a response. 

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is 400 - 16 = 384 emails.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, they ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 24500 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.
3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney was left with 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.
4. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches left is 3 + 3 = 6.
5. The total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. 

The number of trucks that delivered the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

The total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to first calculate the total pounds of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter as follows:

- For the first 3 pounds, he pays full price: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- For the next 3 pounds, he gets one half off: 3 * ($4.00 / 2) = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total number of guests, we need to add the number of classmates, dance class members, and family members, then subtract the number of people who said they could not come. 

Total guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (could not come) = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 

Additional guests = Total guests - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is $6 per guest, so we multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per guest.

Cost for additional guests = 21 * 6 = 126

Now, we add the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost.

Total cost = Initial fee + Cost for additional guests = 125 + 126 = 251

The final answer is: 251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, she now has 3/4 * $60 = $45.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she had $60, she now has 2/3 * $60 = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have left: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total bananas = 315
- First monkey eats 10 bananas per day
- Second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day
- The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to find out how many bananas are left after the first two monkeys eat their share. 

First, let's find out how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in a day: 
10 (first monkey) + 14 (second monkey) = 24 bananas

Now, let's subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day: 
315 (total bananas) - 24 (bananas eaten by first two monkeys) = 291 bananas

So, the third monkey eats 291 bananas each day."

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 

15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total sales from milkshakes:
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the total sales from burger platters:
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Then, let's calculate the total sales from sodas:
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total sales from each item together:
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is not given, we assume Paul is at the station at time 0. The fourth train arrives at 145 minutes, so Paul needs to wait for 145 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved in total, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks she has saved them. 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save. 

200 toothpicks (required) - 120 toothpicks (already saved) = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save 80 toothpicks at the rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he bought it for is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for, so the price he sold it for is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price he bought it for, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

Discount = ((Original Price - Price Paid) / Original Price) * 100
= ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100
= (200 / 2000) * 100
= 0.10 * 100
= 10%

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of jellyfish each spring creates per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in 4 hours. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, each creating 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5 jellyfish/second.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the number of jellyfish created per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score, so we add 15 to 180.

"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the distance to the store and back. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, he walked a total of 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, we can find the total time it took him to walk 8 miles by dividing the total distance by his speed. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"To find out how much Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

If Jenny bought the bananas individually, the cost would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Since Jenny bought the bananas in bunches, the cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet. 

Since they have a total of 100 feet of fence, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to first find out how many inches it grows per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 
8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now that we know the growth rate per year, we can multiply this rate by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years:
2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:

$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to find the total minutes he spends in class per day. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total minutes in a week is 7 * 60 * 24 = 10080 minutes.

1/16 of the total minutes in a week is (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes John spends in class and the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total minutes per week = 1200 + 630 = 1830 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

Total hours per week = 1830 / 60 = 30.5 hours.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate.

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what the velociraptors had. So, the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. 
The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 unshaken and 2 shaken sodas.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans. 

There are 2 shaken cans and 2 unshaken cans, for a total of 4 cans. 

The probability is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

0.5 * 100 = 50%

"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps. 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he helps per day. 
2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day

12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people present is not given, we can assume that the number of people inside the church is equal to the total number of people who were present, which is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes per day.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
To find the total time spent over 5 days, we multiply 1 hour by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we multiply 8 by 3.5 to find Micah's total.

8 * 3.5 = 28

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52
Miles run by Amber = 8
Miles run by Micah = 28
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16

"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x: 
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings will be:

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Next, we need to calculate how much she will need for retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, her annual living expenses in retirement will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

To calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement, we multiply her annual living expenses by the number of years she plans to live in retirement:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000.

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement, but we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to live in retirement. 

40 years - 20 years = 20 years.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the first cut parts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we need to divide the length of each of the first cut parts by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total population of the school, we need to use the information that 40% of the population is 240 boys. 

Let's set up an equation: 40% of the total population = 240 boys. 

We can convert 40% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40/100 = 0.4. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 0.4 * total population = 240. 

To find the total population, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4: total population = 240 / 0.4 = 600.

Now that we know the total population is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population: number of girls = total population - number of boys = 600 - 240 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the garden soil is $26.
The total cost before the discount is $19 + $26 = $45.
The coupon discount is $7.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $45 - $7 = $38.

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.

"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4 inch heels and 3 wearing 2 inch heels).

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height of all the heels divided by the total number of women, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's a total of 250 miles per day. 

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles at this rate, we can divide 9,300 by 250. 

9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days

Since Soledad only has 30 days, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike in 30 days at the rate of 9,300 miles in 37.2 days.

First, we need to find the number of miles she can hike in 30 days at the rate of 250 miles per day. 

250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles

Now, we subtract the number of miles she can hike in 30 days from the total number of miles she wants to hike.

9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

Now, we need to find out how many more days she has to hike the remaining 1,800 miles. 

Since she has 30 days and has already hiked for 2 days (since she hikes twice a day), she has 28 days left.

Now, we divide the remaining miles by the number of days she has left to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day.

1,800 miles / 28 days = 64.29 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike approximately 64.29 miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each type of ball and add them together.

Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The final answer is: $157"
"I think there's a mistake in the names. It seems like there are two people named Pierre and Paul, but then another person named Peter and Jacques. I'll assume the correct names are Pierre, Paul, and Peter, and Jacques is not involved in the problem.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul together want 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

They bought 12 kg, and Pierre and Paul want 7 kg, so Peter will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature: 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop: 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase: 3 degrees Celsius

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had initially, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. 
He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she only has $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount she spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.2 x 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

The total number of students enrolled this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find out how many times the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so we divide 255 by 5 to get the number of blinks per minute. 

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing 459 by the number of blinks per minute, which is 51.

459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial and additional numbers of each type.

Initial male guppies: 4
Additional male guppies: 2
Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6

Initial female guppies: 7
Additional female guppies: 1
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8

Initial male goldfishes: 3
Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes.
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes.
Difference: 16 - 11 = 5

"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip and multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days, we multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days. 

Sofie walks 10 miles per day, so in 7 days, she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we need to divide the total distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk.

Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers, we first need to find the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour and the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

So, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the total number of toys ordered is 400. So, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the 4 workers produce 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to find the weight of each of his dogs and add them together.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's second dog weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

The total weight of all the dogs is 45 (Elijah's dogs) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kris had 7 stickers, and before giving them to Rob, he had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.
2. Since Kris had 16 stickers, and he received them from Luis, Luis must have had 16 stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth, so he must have received twice as many stickers from Seth. Therefore, Seth gave Luis 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
4. Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can find the total number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 km by dividing 20,000 km by 400 km/day.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write the equation: A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
5. Subtract 12 from both sides: 2A + 2S = 44
6. Divide both sides by 2: A + S = 22
7. We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so S + (S + 12) = 30
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2S + 12 = 30
9. Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18
10. Divide both sides by 2: S = 9
11. Now that we know S, we can find A: A + S = 22, so A + 9 = 22
12. Subtract 9 from both sides: A = 13
13. Camden painted S + 12 eggs, so Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
14. The difference between the number of eggs Camden and Arnold painted is 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. To find the total number of boxes, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to find the total weight of the boxes in ounces first. 

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is equal to the total number of crayons:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we add the total weight of the boxes and the total weight of the crayons to find the total weight:

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to find the total weight in pounds:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks is:

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so the total amount he makes is:

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find the speed on the beach.

Time on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles/minute

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute.

The time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent on the entire walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has 60 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he had initially. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24.

So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles and has 60 marbles, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of marbles he had:

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

Now that we know Bob had 36 marbles initially, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles if he loses 10 of the marbles he has.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Initial number of cows = 50
Cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days
Total cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited = 20 * 21 = 420
Total number of cows = 50 + 420 = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Initial number of chickens = 20
Chickens brought by Broilers Limited per day = 10
Total chickens brought by Broilers Limited = 10 * 21 = 210
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210 = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 + 230
= 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, we need to first calculate the original price of 4 packs of bagels. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $40.00 is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 9 x 4 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 ÷ 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 

1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many scoops Gomer ate, we need to know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. 

5 less than 23 scoops is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we know it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to divide the number of scoops by 2 and then multiply by 3.

18 scoops / 2 = 9
9 * 3 = 27

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know the number of green and red jellybeans, which is 17 + 34 = 51. 

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 
60 - 51 = 9.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The cost of a sunflower is $2.
- The cost of a bouquet is $8, which contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. Since he earns $26 from sunflowers per day, and each sunflower costs $2, we can divide the earnings by the cost of a sunflower to find the number of sunflowers sold per day:

$26 (daily earnings from sunflowers) / $2 (cost of a sunflower) = 13 sunflowers per day

Next, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since he earns $56 from bouquets per day, and each bouquet costs $8, we can divide the earnings by the cost of a bouquet to find the number of bouquets sold per day:

$56 (daily earnings from bouquets) / $8 (cost of a bouquet) = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

7 bouquets per day * 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold individually and the sunflowers in the bouquets:

13 sunflowers per day (sold individually) + 84 sunflowers per day (in bouquets) = 97 sunflowers per day

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

97 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to first calculate how many rocks he buys, how much he sells, and then the difference between his initial investment and the money he has left after selling 60% of his inventory.

Adam has $100 to invest. He buys rocks for $5 each. 

Number of rocks he buys = Total money / Price per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

He sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks.
Number of rocks sold = 20 * 0.6
= 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7. 
Total money made from selling rocks = Number of rocks sold * Price per rock
= 12 * $7
= $84

Adam initially had $100. After selling 12 rocks, he has $84 left. 
However, he still has 8 rocks left unsold. Since he bought 20 rocks, he still has 8 rocks worth of investment left. 
Value of unsold rocks = Number of unsold rocks * Price per rock
= 8 * $5
= $40

Total money Adam has left = Money made from selling rocks + Value of unsold rocks
= $84 + $40
= $124

However, Adam initially had $100. Since he has $124 now, he actually made a profit of $24. But the question asks for the amount of money he loses. Since he made a profit, the amount of money he loses is $0.

The final answer is $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of large, medium, and small-sized picture scenes Lauren needs to draw. 

First, let's find the LCM of 45, 36, and 49. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 49 is 7^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(45, 36, 49) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 49 = 8820.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene:
- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The greatest common multiple of the days is 63 days."

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6. 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person. 

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100% / 20% = 5 times the number of bottles.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. Since one person needs 5 bottles, 2300 people would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we need to subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles needed: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and then divide it by the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's start by finding the number of babies wearing purple. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, we can calculate the number of purple babies as follows:

Number of purple babies = 8 * (3/4) = 6

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and bows. 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so we can calculate the number of purple babies wearing bows as follows:

Number of purple babies wearing bows = 6 * (1/3) = 2

Next, let's find the total number of babies wearing bows. We know that 1/4 of the babies wear blue, and 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the number of blue babies wearing bows and the number of purple babies wearing bows:

Number of blue babies = 8 * (1/4) = 2
Number of blue babies wearing bows = 2
Number of purple babies wearing bows = 2
Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 + 2 = 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100:

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from selling the land.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So, the total amount of land sold so far is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters.

This means he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Haley's age is 26 years. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so we need to subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Initially, Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total found from the initial number: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total amount he gets paid for each collection.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
200 + 200 = 400

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640

Now, let's find the total number of apartments:
400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:
1040 * 3 = 3120

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount he makes per week is:
3120 * 0.40 = $1248

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet, so we'll come back to this.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's find the production of an 8-year-old tree. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, and a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

- Year 4 (8 years old): 800 fruits

Now we have all the information we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life.

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Ronnie was given x dollars. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

Initially, Ronnie had x dollars and Rissa had 3x dollars.

After they gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's say they each gave y dollars. So, Ronnie was left with x - y dollars and Rissa was left with 3x - y dollars.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means 3x - y = (4/5)(3x). 

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 5(3x - y) = 4(3x).

Expanding the equation, we get 15x - 5y = 12x.

Now, let's isolate y by moving the x terms to one side: -5y = 12x - 15x.

Combine like terms: -5y = -3x.

Divide both sides by -5: y = (3/5)x.

Now, we know that Ronnie was left with x - y dollars. We can substitute y = (3/5)x into this expression: x - (3/5)x.

To simplify, we can factor out x: x - (3/5)x = (2/5)x.

So, Ronnie is left with (2/5)x dollars.

We are given that Ronnie was initially given $5, so x = 5. 

Now, we can substitute x = 5 into the expression (2/5)x to find the amount of money Ronnie is left with: (2/5)(5) = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The other half of the mural is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can set up the equation:

3x + 6 = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 6

Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are three colors, the amount of red paint is x = 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12. 

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has $1200, he needs 1200 / 5 = 240 5 dollar bills.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide it by the amount of chalk used each day.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

The teacher then goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. 

To find out how many days the chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day.

20% of 1 inch = 0.2 * 1 = 0.2 inches

Now, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day:

2.75 inches / 0.2 inches per day = 13.75 days

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls in total, the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C.

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats. 

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since Kate has 6 friends, the total number of slices her friends will eat is 10 * 6 = 60.

The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many of each pizza Kate needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of slices her friends will eat by the number of slices each pizza is cut into.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since Kate can't buy a fraction of a pizza, she needs to buy 8 pepperoni pizzas (rounding up from 7.5) to have enough slices for her friends.

So, Kate needs to buy 5 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

The total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is 5 + 8 = 13."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds and how many melt in a given time period. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 60 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he builds 20 * (15/60) = 5 snowballs. 

In 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. 

Let's calculate the net number of snowballs Jay has after 15 minutes: 5 (built) - 2 (melted) = 3 snowballs.

Now, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take to reach 60 snowballs. We can do this by dividing 60 by the net number of snowballs Jay has after each 15-minute interval, which is 3.

60 / 3 = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply 20 intervals by 15 minutes to get the total time: 20 * 15 = 300 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 (since they ordered 2 packs of 50) - 25 bandages.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

x = 21

The initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is 21.

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings. 

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. 
Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we multiply the hours she works per day by the number of days she works per week and then by the number of weeks in April. 
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we need to add the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on both days.

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 90 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much root beer was left, we need to subtract the amount consumed each day from the initial amount. 

Initially, there were 24 gallons of root beer. 
On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons were left.
On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons were left.
On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons were left.

Now, 3 people, including Fred, are sharing the remaining root beer. To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people: 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of 66. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. 

The number of fish without red stripes is 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of 44.

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

Now, we need to add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

The total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

"Amy initially had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy used up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set. Now, she has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison, so the first floor's height is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then subtract that from the total average miles walked by all four dogs.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs to walk 4 miles, and the third needs to walk 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

The average miles walked by all four dogs is 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles * Number of dogs = 3 * 4 = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk.

Miles walked by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
= 12 - 8

"To find out how much John borrowed, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

He used 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply it by the price per kilogram.

The total weight of the tunas is 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class capacity is 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount borrowed plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans will be 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed.

However, the problem does not state that Tim made a guess.  To solve the problem, we will assume that he guessed the number of red jelly beans to be 864. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered the bus at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups and the total time required for all students to participate.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the total number of groups: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group uses 45 minutes to try and escape, so the total time required for all students to participate is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

"Let's call the length of the shorter piece 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying 8 by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound.

5 pounds of ground beef * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

"Let's break down the information given. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount from the standard lessons and the amount from the veteran lessons separately, then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. 
4 * $80 = $320

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. 
25% of $80 is 0.25 * $80 = $20. 
So, his reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.
He has 2 lessons at this rate.
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the amounts from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons together.
$320 + $120 = $440

The mean score is 70."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to first find out how many pomelos she has left. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can multiply the original amount by 1/4 to find the remaining amount.

Remaining pomelos = 20 * 1/4 = 5

Now, we know Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to subtract the remaining amount from the original amount.

Pomelos given away = Original amount - Remaining amount
= 20 - 5
= 15

"To find out how many apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples were left. 

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples were left.

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = 81

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. 
Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. Since 84 grapes were used, the initial number of grapes is x - 84.

We know that the initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes eaten by Madeline, used by her brother, and used by their mother. So, we can set up the equation:

x = 6 + 30 + 48

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 84

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. 

First, we need to find the total number of minutes the custodian has to clean the classrooms. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they have 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day. 

Since they have 5 days, the total number of minutes they have to clean the classrooms is 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find the total number of minutes it takes to clean all the classrooms. Since it takes them 15 minutes per classroom, and there are 80 classrooms, the total number of minutes is 15 * 80 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms. To do this, we divide the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of minutes they have to clean, and then multiply by 100.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. 
Two middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase to find out how many bookcases she needs. 
110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since the bag contains 30 sticks of jerky, we need to divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 
60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right. 
70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We know that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting B = 5S - 4 into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S = 20, we can find B by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

For the rooms, half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms in total, half of them is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is 120 * $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is $240 * 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade can upload per day. She uploads 6 batches of 7 photos each day, so she uploads 6 x 7 = 42 photos per day.

Now, let's divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day: 210 / 42 = 5.

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos."
"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for one week and then multiply it by 5.

- 1 skirt at $6.00: $6.00
- 2 pants at $8.00 each: 2 x $8.00 = $16.00
Total cost for one week: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

Now, multiply the total cost for one week by 5:
$47.00 x 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To find John's new speaking speed, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert WPM to words per second by dividing by 60.

New speed (words per second) = 375 WPM / 60 = 6.25 words per second

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. 

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed (words per second) = 4500 words / 6.25 words per second = 720 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert seconds to minutes by dividing by 60.

Time (minutes) = 720 seconds / 60 = 12 minutes

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500 people.

"To find the total number of popcorn pieces, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

The final answer is: 210"
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, which is 4 gallons for the party plus 1 extra gallon for Allen. 

Total gallons of lemonade = 4 + 1 = 5 gallons

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 5 gallons will require 5 cups of lemon juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed to get 5 cups of juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can set up a proportion to find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice.

6 lemons / 1 cup = x lemons / 5 cups

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6 * 5 = 1 * x
30 = x

So, Tim will need 30 lemons in total.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed per day, we need to calculate the total consumption of the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs separately and then add them together.

The 3 German Shepherds consume 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms of dog food per day.
The 2 Bulldogs consume 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms of dog food per day.

The total consumption per day is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the total consumption for a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7.

"To find the total number of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For the 2-legged animals, each animal has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is 10 * 2 = 20.

For the 4-legged animals, each animal has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is 15 * 4 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals: 20 + 60 = 80.

The total number of pairs of animal legs is half of the total number of legs, since each pair consists of 2 legs. So, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the information given. 

The tower is made out of 4 blue blocks. 
There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.
The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.
Since there are 32 blocks in the tower in total, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.
Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - (Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks)
= 32 - 12
= 20

"To find the distance Elvis traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

To find the distance Elvis traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

The bag has 54 red candies. It has twice that amount of orange candies, so the number of orange candies is 54 * 2 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

We know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - (Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies)

- Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Randy has:
10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, then add them together.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so half of them would be 12 / 2 = 6.

For the first half, he would get 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 * $7 = $42.

The total amount Matthew would earn is $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. So, the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Now, Nate starts filling in the holes at a rate of 9 holes per day. However, the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we need to find the difference in enrollment between the two schools.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to first determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs: 10 + 20 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total amount of money they all raised, we need to add up the amounts raised by each girl: 
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa would run 1 mile in 2x minutes. 

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa, we can set up the equation: x * 2 = 16, where x is the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile. 

Solving for x, we get x = 16 / 2 = 8 minutes. 

Now, we know that Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x minutes, which is 2 * 8 = 16 minutes. 

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, the total time it took her to complete her part of the race is 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. So, we need to subtract this from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we first need to find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost of each watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons: $80 / 50 = $1.60 per watermelon.

The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. This means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit). 

Let's denote the cost price as CP and the selling price as SP. We know that SP = 1.25 * CP. We also know that CP = $1.60. 

So, SP = 1.25 * $1.60 = $2.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is 2 * 12 = 24 years old now.
2. Since James is 24 years old now, and he was born when John was 19, John is now 24 + 19 = 43 years old.
3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, which means the youngest son is 43 - 32 = 11 years old now.
4. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem. 

Ana peels 1 orange in 3 minutes, so in 1 hour (60 minutes), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels 1 orange in 4 minutes, so in 1 hour (60 minutes), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original cost. 
20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the total labor cost is $50 x 3 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. So, the total number of legs can be expressed as 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, substitute W in the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expand the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

The number of chickens is 5."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
