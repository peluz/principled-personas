"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the unknown:** 
    * Let 'x' be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

* **Calculate sales at the green house:**
    * Melanie sold (1/3)x vacuum cleaners at the greenhouse.

* **Sales at the red house:**
    * She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold (1/3)x + 2.

* **Sales at the orange house:**
    * She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house, which is (1/2) * (x - (1/3)x - 2).

* **Total sales:**
    * The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of sales at all three houses: (1/3)x + 2 + (1/2) * (x - (1/3)x - 2) = 5

* **Solve for x:**
    * Simplify the equation: (1/3)x + 2 + (1/2)x - (1/6)x - 1 = 5
    * Combine like terms: (1/6)x + 1 = 5
    * Subtract 1 from both sides: (1/6)x = 4

"Here's how to calculate the price increase and the final cost:

* **Calculate the price increase per month:** 20% of $20 = $4
* **Calculate the price after each two-month period:** 
    * Month 1: $20 + $4 = $24
    * Month 2: $24 + $4 = $28
    * Month 3: $28 + $4 = $32
    * ... and so on
* **Calculate the total price after 36 months:**  This requires a bit of a calculation, but we can use a formula to simplify it. 

**The formula:**

The price after *n* months is: 
P(n) = 20 * (1 + 0.20)^n

**Applying the formula:**

P(36) = 20 * (1 + 0.20)^36 
P(36) = 20 * (1.20)^36
P(36) ≈ $100.80

**Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost approximately $100.80 after 36 months.**

"Let's break down this problem using variables and equations.

* Let Seth's current age be represented by 'S'
* Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'

We know:

* S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* (2B) + B + 2 = 28

Simplify and solve for B:

* 3B + 2 = 28
* 3B = 26
* B = 26/3 

Since Brooke's age is a fraction, we can't have a fractional age. This means there's likely an error in the problem statement.

**1. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay:**

* Janeth's monthly payment is $165.
* She will pay for 12 months.
* Total payment: $165 * 12 = $1980

**2. Calculate the total amount Janeth borrowed:**

* Janeth's total payment ($1980) is the sum of her original loan and the additional 10% she promised to pay back.

"Let's break down this problem using variables to represent Ruby's and Sam's current ages.

* Let Ruby's current age be represented by ""R""
* Let Sam's current age be represented by ""S""

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** R = 6S  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **Equation 2:** R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for S (Sam's current age). 

**Solve for R in Equation 1:**
R = 6S

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the time it takes for the slower car to travel 480 miles.  We know the faster car's speed and the distance it travels.

**Key Concepts**

* **Speed, Distance, and Time:**  The relationship between these three is defined by the formula:  
   * Speed = Distance / Time
* **Relative Speed:** The speed of the slower car is half the speed of the faster car.

**Solution**

1. **Find the speed of the slower car:** The slower car travels at 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

2. **Use the formula to find the time:**
   * Time = Distance / Speed

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Determine the charge needed:**  The phone needs to reach 100% charge, which is 100% - 60% = 40% of charge remaining.
* **Calculate the time:**  Since the phone charges at 1% per 3 minutes, we need to find the time it takes to add 40% of charge.
* **Set up a proportion:**  Let 'x' be the time in minutes. We can set up a proportion: 
   (1/3) = (40/100) / x
* **Solve for x:**
   * Cross-multiply: 100 * 40 = 3 * 1
   * Simplify: 4000 = 3
   * Divide both sides by 3: x = 1333.33 minutes
* **Convert to hours:** 1333.33 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 22.22 hours

**Therefore, it will take approximately 22.22 hours to fully charge the phone.**

"Let's break down this problem using variables and equations:

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know:

* c + w = 60 (The total number of animals is 60)
* c = 2w (He has twice as many chickens as cows)

Now we can solve for the number of animals:

1. **Substitute:** Since we know c = 2w, we can substitute that into the first equation: 2w + w = 60
2. **Simplify:** Combine the 'w' terms: 3w = 60
3. **Solve for 'w':** Divide both sides by 3: w = 20 
4. **Solve for 'c':**  Since c = 2w, substitute the value of 'w': c = 2 * 20 = 40

Now we know:
* c = 40 chickens
* w = 20 cows

Finally, calculate the total number of legs:

* Chickens have 2 legs each: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs
* Cows have 4 legs each: 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* Total legs: 80 legs + 80 legs = 160 legs

"To calculate the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating simple interest:

**A = P * r * t**

Where:

* A = the future value of the loan (the amount Karan will pay back)
* P = the principal amount borrowed (the initial loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* t = the time period in years

First, we need to convert the interest rate to a decimal: 10% = 0.10

Next, we need to convert the time period to years: 5 months / 12 months/year = 0.4167 years

Now we can plug the values into the formula:

A = 3650 * 0.10 * 0.4167

A = 151.99

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we can calculate the monthly payment by dividing the total amount she will pay back by the number of months:

Monthly payment = A / Number of months

Monthly payment = 151.99 / 5 = **30.398**


**Answer: 30.398**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Joanne's apples from the shortest trees:** Joanne gathered half the number of apples from the shortest trees as the tallest trees, so she gathered 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
* **Joanne's apples from the average trees:**  She gathered more apples from the average trees than the shortest trees, so let's call the number of apples from the average trees ""x"".
* **Joanne's total apples:** Joanne gathered 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x apples.
* **Sister's apples from the tallest trees:** Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 30 * 2 = 60 apples.
* **Sister's apples from the shortest trees:** She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 15 * 3 = 45 apples.
* **Sister's total apples:** Her sister gathered 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105 apples.
* **Combined total:** The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.
* **Solving for x:**  Combining like terms, we get 150 + x = 500. Subtracting 150 from both sides, we get x = 350.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the daily savings in the first half of the month.
* Elvis saves twice as much in the second half, so he saves 2x in the second half.

**2. Set up the Equation:**

* Total savings in the first half: x * (number of days in the first half)
* Total savings in the second half: 2x * (number of days in the second half)
* Total savings goal: 1125 

**3.  Determine the Number of Days:**

* We need to find the number of days in the first half and the second half of the month. 

**4.  Calculate the Savings in the Second Half:**

*  We know Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. 
*  Let's assume the number of days in the first half is 'n'. 
*  The total savings in the first half would be x * n.
*  The total savings in the second half would be 2x * (n + 1) (since there is one extra day in the second half).
*  We can set up an equation: x * n + 2x * (n + 1) = 1125

**5. Solve for x:**

*  Simplify the equation: x * n + 2x * n + 2x = 1125
*  Combine like terms: 3x * n + 2x = 1125
*  Factor out x: x(3n + 2) = 1125
*  Solve for x: x = 1125 / (3n + 2)

**6.  Determine the Number of Days in the Second Half:**

*  We need to find the number of days in the second half of the month. 

**7.  Calculate the Daily Savings in the Second Half:**

*  Substitute the value of x back into the equation for the second half savings: 2x * (n + 1)

**8.  Final Answer:**

*  The final answer will be the daily savings in the second half of the month. 



Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the calculation of the number of days in the first half and the second half of the month.

    * Richie scored 20 more than Mark: R = M + 20

* **Solve for Mark's goals (M):**
    * Since R = A + 45 and R = M + 20, we can substitute to find M:  M + 20 = A + 45
    * Therefore, M = A + 25

* **Solve for Anna's goals (A):**
    * Substitute the value of M back into the equation M = A + 25:  A = (M - 25)

* **Substitute to find the total goals:**
    * We know R = 80, and R = M + 20. Substitute M = A + 25: 80 = (A + 25) + 20
    * Simplify: 80 = A + 45
    * Solve for A: A = 35

* **Calculate the total goals:**

"Let's break down this problem using a strategic approach:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
*  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are '0.9x' red jelly beans.
*  Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are '1.01x' green jelly beans.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green: 
x + 0.9x + 1.01x = 4500

**Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 2.9x = 4500
* Divide both sides by 2.9: x = 1551.7 (approximately)

**Calculate the difference in green and red jelly beans:**

* Green jelly beans: 1.01x = 1.01 * 1551.7 = 1567.8 (approximately)
* Red jelly beans: 0.9x = 0.9 * 1551.7 = 1396.7 (approximately)
* Difference: 1567.8 - 1396.7 = 171.1

**Answer:** The jar contains approximately **171.1** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of branches Felix climbed.
* Let 'y' represent the number of days he worked.

**2. Set up the Equation:**

* Felix's earnings are based on the number of branches climbed and his hourly rate. 
* We know his earnings are $105, and he charges $0.25 per branch.
* We can express this as an equation: 0.25x * y = $105

**3. Solve for x (the number of branches climbed):**

* We need to find the value of 'x' that satisfies the equation. 
* Divide both sides of the equation by 0.25: 
   * x * y = $105 / 0.25
   * x * y = $420

**4.  Find the average number of branches climbed per day:**

* To find the average number of branches climbed per day, we need to divide the total number of branches climbed by the number of days worked.
*  x / y = $420 / $105 
*  x / y = 4

**5.  Answer:**

Felix climbed an average of **4** branches per day.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables to represent the unknown quantities:

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.
* The total number of cards is 341, so x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Now, let's solve the equation:

* 7x + 12 = 341
* 7x = 329
* x = 47 

Since Smendrick has 3x cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos' speed:**  Let's assume each kangaroo travels at a speed of 'k' miles per hour.
* **Total distance:**  Since the kangaroos travel together, the total distance is the same for all of them.
* **Turtles' speed:** Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is 'k/2' miles per hour.

**Setting up the Equation**

We know the following:

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Total time for kangaroos: 18 hours
* Total distance = Constant
* Speed of each kangaroo: k
* Speed of each turtle: k/2

Let's use the formula for time to set up an equation:

18 hours = (Distance) / (k) 

**Solving for Distance**

We can rewrite the equation to solve for the distance:

Distance = 18 hours * k

**Calculating Time for Turtles**

Now, let's consider the time it takes four turtles to travel the same distance:

Time for turtles = (Distance) / (Speed of each turtle)
Time for turtles = (Distance) / (k/2)
Time for turtles = (Distance) * (2/k)

**Finding the Relationship**

Notice that the distance is the same for both scenarios.  We can substitute the distance we found earlier:

Time for turtles = (18 hours * k) * (2/k)

**Simplifying**

Time for turtles = 36 hours

**Final Answer:** 
 
 **36 hours**

* **Your brother's age is ""x + 3""**
* **Your sister's age is ""x - 2""**
* **Your mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1**

Now, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 87

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 75

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 10.71

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let  'x' represent the number of books Fawn has.
* Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has 'x - 12' books.
* Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has 'x - 12 + 25' books, which simplifies to 'x + 13' books.

Now we can set up an equation representing the total number of books:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combining like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Solving for x:

3x = 84
x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has **28** books.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm.**
* **Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 2x.**
* **Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm, so it's 2x + 100 acres.**

**The total acreage is the sum of both farms:**

* **Total acreage = Farmer Brown's acreage + Farmer Smith's acreage**
* **Total acreage = x + (2x + 100)**

**Simplify the equation:**

* **Total acreage = 3x + 100**

**We know the total acreage is 200 acres:**

* **200 = 3x + 100**

**Solve for x:**

* **100 = 3x**
* **x = 33.33 (approximately)**

**Now that we know Farmer Brown's acreage, we can find Farmer Smith's acreage:**

* **Farmer Smith's acreage = 2x + 100 = 2(33.33) + 100 = 66.66 + 100 = 166.66 (approximately)**

**Finally, calculate the total acreage:**

* **Total acreage = Farmer Brown's acreage + Farmer Smith's acreage = 33.33 + 166.66 = 200**


**Therefore, the total acreage of the two farms is approximately 200 acres.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the initial amount of water in the tank:** The tank is filled with half the pool's water, so it holds 10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons.

2. **Calculate the total water used:**  The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days it will be emptied of 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

3. **Calculate the remaining water:** The tank started with 5000 gallons and was emptied by 3000 gallons, leaving 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons.

    * Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
    * Let Paul's age be represented by 'P + 10' (since he's 10 years older than John)
    * Let John's age be represented by 'J'

* **Set up the equations:**
    *  P + P + J = 100  (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100)
    *  P = P + 10 + J  (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for P:**
    * Simplify the second equation: P = P + 10 + J
    *  Subtract P from both sides: 0 = 10 + J
    *  Solve for J: J = -10 

* **This result is not possible:**  A person cannot have a negative age. This indicates there's an inconsistency in the given information.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips the other two people received.**
* **The third person received 15 more than the others, so they received x + 15.**
* **The total number of corn chips received by the three people is 70 + 70 + (x + 15) = 150 + x**
* **Since two people received an equal amount, the total number of corn chips must be divisible by 2.**

**To find the value of x, we can use the fact that the total number of corn chips is divisible by 2:**

* **150 + x = 2 * (x + 15)**
* **150 + x = 2x + 30**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables to represent the unknown quantities:

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

* A + S + W = 339  (The total number of Pokemon caught)
* A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Now, we can solve for 'S' (Stan's catch count):

1. **Substitute** the first equation (A = S + 5) into the second equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W = 334

3. **Substitute** the third equation (S = 4W - 13) into the simplified equation:
   2S + (4W - 13) = 334

4. **Solve for W** in terms of 'S' in the third equation:
   2S + 4W - 13 = 334
   4W = 347 - 2S
   W = (347 - 2S) / 4

5. **Substitute** this value of 'W' back into the equation 2S + W = 334:
   2S + ((347 - 2S) / 4) = 334

6. **Simplify and solve for 'S':**
   8S + 347 - 2S = 1336
   6S = 989
   S = 164.83

**Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we need to check our work.  Let's assume the problem meant to say Stan caught 165 Pokemon.**


**Therefore, Stan has caught 165 Pokemon.**

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.** 
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, meaning it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
   - Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank. 
   - We know that 9% of the initial charge is lost each hour, so after 5 hours, the power bank had 95% of its capacity remaining. 
   - This can be represented as: 0.95x = 0.95 * x 
   - Therefore, the initial charge (x) can be calculated as: x = 0.95 * x 
   - This means the power bank had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, meaning it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours. 

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge after the next 3 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, meaning it had 93% of its capacity remaining after 3 hours. 

* **Step 4: Calculate the final charge.**
   - The power bank had 28% of its capacity remaining after 8 hours.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so a large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.**
* **We know that the total earnings from all stuffed animals is $120, so $8x + $12 * x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding Proportional Pricing:**  The prices are proportional, meaning the number of sandwiches and the price are directly related.  
* **Finding the Ratio:**  
    * The first package has 2 sandwiches at $3.
    * The second package has 4 sandwiches at $6.
    * This means the ratio of price to sandwiches is $3:2 and $6:4.
* **Finding the Missing Price:**
    *  To find the price of the 8-sandwich package, we need to find the missing value in the ratio. 
    *  Let 'x' be the price of the 8-sandwich package.
    *  The ratio of price to sandwiches for the 8-sandwich package is x:8.
    *  We can set up a proportion:  $3/2 = $6/4 = x/8
    *  Solving for x: x = (3 * 4) / 2 = 6

**Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $6.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w'
* Let Colin's current age be represented by 'c'

**Setting up the equations:**

* **Wendy's age in 7 years:** w + 7 
* **Colin's age in 7 years:** c + 7
* **Wendy's age in 25 years:** w + 25
* **Colin's age in 25 years:** c + 25
 
**The problem states:**

* ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""  This translates to: w + 7 = 5(c + 7)
* ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now."" This translates to: c + 25 = (1/3)(w + 25)

**Solving the system of equations:**

1. **Simplify the equations:**
   * w + 7 = 5c + 35
   * c + 25 = (1/3)(w + 25)

2. **Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' in the first equation:**
   * w = 5c + 28

3. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   * c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 28 + 25)

4. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   * c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 53)
   * 3c + 75 = 5c + 53
   * 2c = 22
   * c = 11

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we can use the following equation:

Total cookies = Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies + Chocolate chip cookies

We know the total number of cookies is 7995, and we know the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies.  Let's represent the number of chocolate chip cookies with the variable ""x"".

7995 = 2595 + 3075 + x

Now, we can solve for x:

7995 = 5670 + x
x = 7995 - 5670
x = 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made **2325** chocolate chip cookies.

* **Find the youngest son's age in 3 years:** The youngest son was born when John was 32, so he is currently 32 - 3 = 29 years old. In 3 years, he will be 29 + 3 = 32 years old.

**Answer:** 32

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem focuses on the time it takes to peel oranges and the difference in peeling speed between Ana and Jane. We need to determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled after an hour.

**Assumptions**

* **Constant Rate:** We assume both Ana and Jane peel oranges at a constant rate throughout the hour.
* **Equal Time:**  We assume they start peeling at the same time and continue for an hour.

**Solution**

1. **Calculate Ana's peeling time:** 
   * Ana peels 1 orange per minute.
   * In an hour, she peels 60 oranges.

2. **Calculate Jane's peeling time:**
   * Jane peels 1 orange per minute.
   * In an hour, she peels 60 oranges.

3. **Determine the difference:**
   * The difference in the number of oranges peeled is 60 - 60 = 0.

**Answer:** 0

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.**


**Answer: 5**
