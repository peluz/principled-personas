"The discount is 25% of the original price.  To find the original price, we can set up a proportion:

* Let 'x' be the original price.
* The discount is 0.25x 
* The price after the discount is $19.50.

We can write this as an equation:

x - 0.25x = $19.50

Simplify the equation:

0.75x = $19.50

Solve for x:

x = $19.50 / 0.75

x = $26.00

**Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.**

* Let Darrell's current age be 7x
* Let Allen's current age be 11x

Their total age is 162, so: 7x + 11x = 162

**Solving for x:**

* 18x = 162
* x = 162 / 18 
* x = 9

**Calculating Allen's Age in 10 Years:**

* Allen's current age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99
* Allen's age in 10 years will be 99 + 10 = 109

**Answer:** Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Mark's age two years ago:**  Since Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago, we know half of Jan's age two years ago was 30 / 2 = 15. Mark was 5 years older than that, so he was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
* **Mark's current age:** Mark is currently 20 + 2 = 22 years old.
* **Jean's age:** Jean is two years older than Mark, so she is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:** There are three numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) on a six-sided die.  The probability of rolling one of these is 3/6 = 1/2.
* **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:** There are three even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  To get the probability of two even numbers in a row, we multiply these probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.
* **Difference in probabilities:** The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4. The difference is (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4.
* **Percentage:** To express the difference as a percentage, multiply by 100%: (1/4) * 100% = 25%

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool initially.
    * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool, so it initially had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, so in 4 minutes, they lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, meaning it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
    * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We know they have the same amount of water after 4 minutes.

* **Solve for x:**
    * 8x = x - 16
    * 7x = -16
    * x = -16/7

* **The answer is not possible:**
    * We cannot have negative water. This means there's an error in the problem setup. 


**Final answer:**  The problem has an error.

    * The difference in snails is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

* **Fish Difference:**
    * The difference in snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  This means 28 = 2 * x

* **Solving for x:**
    * 28 = 2x
    * x = 14

**Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.**

* **Let's represent the starting floor as ""x"".**
* **The problem states:**  ""Bill's floor is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6.""

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let Ruby's current age be 'R'**
* **Let Sam's current age be 'S'**

We know:

* **R = 6S** (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **R + 9 = 3(S + 9)** (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for S (Sam's current age):

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** 
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We know the speed of the car in the slow lane is half the speed of the car in the fast lane.  We also know the distance traveled by the car in the fast lane. We need to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance.

**Using the Formula**

We can use the following formula to relate speed, distance, and time:

* **Distance = Speed x Time**

**Solving for Time**

1. **Find the speed of the car in the slow lane:** The car in the slow lane travels at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, so its speed is 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

2. **Rearrange the formula to solve for time:** Time = Distance / Speed

3. **Calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane:** Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Let's break down the information:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is 105:  x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now, let's solve for x:**

"Here's how to break down the calculation:

**Step 1: Calculate the time for the initial leg of the trip.**

* Distance: 200 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the time for the detour.**

* Distance: 10 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the time for the return trip.**

* Distance: 240 miles
* Speed: 80 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the total time.**

* Total time = Time for initial leg + Time for detour + Time for return trip
* Total time = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours

**Final Answer: 6.00 hours**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.**
* **Four times that number minus 5 equals the number kicked out for shoplifting:** 4x - 5
* **Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence:** 3(4x - 5)
* **The total number of people kicked out is 50:** x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* 5x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50
* 17x - 20 = 50
* 17x = 70
* x = 70 / 17
* x = 4.12 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to consider the context of the problem.  It's likely that the question is asking for the number of people kicked out for reasons other than the three categories mentioned. 

**Therefore, we can assume that the question is asking for the number of people kicked out for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence.**

**The answer is 50 - 4.12 = 45.88**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate Cho's total distance:**

* Cho's distance = Speed * Time
* Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

**2. Calculate Chloe's distance:**

* Chloe's distance = Speed * Time
* Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

**3. Find the difference in distance:**

* Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
* Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

**Answer:** 67 kilometers

"Let's break down the problem:

* **What we know:** Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.
* **Let's represent the unknown:**  Let 'x' be the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

**Setting up the equation:**

*  (3/5)x =  the amount of land sold
*  x - (3/5)x = 12.8 hectares 

**Solving for x:**

1.  (2/5)x = 12.8 hectares

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate daily energy consumption:**

* The AC uses 900 watts per hour.
* Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
* Daily energy consumption: 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours

**2. Calculate energy saved per day:**

* Mel reduces his usage by 5 hours.

* **Joanne's apples from the average trees:**  She gathered more apples from the average trees than the shortest trees, so let's call the number of apples from the average trees ""x"".
* **Joanne's total apples:** Joanne gathered 30 + 15 + x apples.
* **Sister's apples from the tallest trees:** Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 30 * 2 = 60 apples.
* **Sister's apples from the shortest trees:** She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 15 * 3 = 45 apples.
* **Total apples gathered by the sister:** The sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples.
* **Combined total:** The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, so Joanne's apples plus the sister's apples equals 500.
* **Solving for x:**  We know Joanne's total is 30 + 15 + x = 500.  Solving for x, we get x = 500 - 30 - 15 = 455.


**Therefore, Joanne gathered 455 apples from the average trees.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of camels.**
* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries):

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
   360 - 2d + d = 304
   -d = -56
   d = 56

**Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.**

* **David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.**

* **Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.**

* **Together they found 43 insects, so x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43**

* **Combine like terms: 3x/2 + 7 = 43**

* **Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x/2 = 36**

* **Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 72**

* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 24**

* **David found x/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.**

* **Lily found (x/2) + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.**


**Therefore, Lily found 19 insects.**

* **Total goals for all three:**  We know Richie scored 80, Mark scored a number of goals, and Anna scored 35.  To find the total, we need to add their individual scores.

**Let's calculate the total goals:**

* Mark's goals:  We need to find out how many goals Mark scored.
* Anna's goals: We know Anna scored 35 goals.
* Richie's goals: We know Richie scored 80 goals.

**Total goals:** 80 + Mark's goals + 35 = Total goals

"To find the correct temperature, we need to determine the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the desired temperature. 

The difference is 468 - 520 = -52.

The percentage difference is (-52 / 520) * 100% = -10%.

To compensate for the 10% difference, we need to add 10% of 520 to the desired temperature.

"Jerry's age 5 years ago was represented by the variable ""x"".  We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2 * (x - 5)

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we need to solve for x and then add 3. 

Let's solve the equation:

x = 2 * (x - 5)
x = 2x - 10
-x = -10
x = 10

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old. In 3 years, he will be 10 + 3 = **13 years old**.

"To find the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can use the following formula:

**Time = Distance / Speed**

We know the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is:

**Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour**

Now, to find the time for the additional 2000 miles, we can use the same formula:

**Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours**

Therefore, it would take **5 hours** to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Lynn's distance be represented by ""L""
    * Paisley's distance is ""P""
    * Reggie's distance is ""R""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  P = 4 miles (Paisley ran 4 miles)
    *  R = 5 * P + 3 miles (Reggie ran 5 times Paisley's distance plus 3 miles)
    *  L = L (Lynn's distance is unknown)

* **Substitute the value of P into the equation for R:**
    * R = 5 * 4 + 3 miles = 23 miles

* **Now we can find Lynn's distance (L):**
    *  R = L + P + 4 miles

"To calculate the time it takes Bob to dig the hole, we need to consider the volume of the hole. 

The volume of a rectangular prism (like a hole) is calculated by:

Volume = length x width x depth

In this case:

Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot, we can calculate the total time:

Time = Volume / Shovel Time per cubic foot

Time = 72 cubic feet / 3 seconds/cubic foot = 24 seconds

**Therefore, it will take Bob 24 seconds to dig the hole.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **First month's sales:** Let 'x' represent the total sales from green hats.  Since red hat sales were half of the total, Ariadne earned $400 from red hats, meaning she earned x/2 from green hats.
* **Total sales in the first month:**  The total sales in the first month is x + 400.
* **Second month's sales:**  The second month's sales were 3/4 of the first month's sales, so she earned (3/4) * (x + 400).
* **Total sales in two months:**  To find the total sales in two months, we need to add the sales of both months.

**Let's set up an equation:**

*  x + 400 = (3/4) * (x + 400)

**Solve for x:**

* 4x + 1600 = 3x + 300
* x = 1200

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Time with arms raised:** Helga dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.
* **Time with arms down:** Helga dances without her arms raised for 3 minutes.
* **Taps per minute with arms down:**  She taps her right foot at 300 taps/minute and her left foot at 250 taps/minute, for a total of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Convert Topher's shoe length to inches:** 8 feet and 4 inches is equal to 8 * 12 + 4 = 96 inches + 4 = 100 inches.

* **Set up an equation:** Let 'x' represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  We know Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe: 100 inches = 9x + 10 inches.

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Subtract 10 inches from both sides: 90 inches = 9x
    * Divide both sides by 9: x = 10 inches

**Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Dora's father's age:** Let's represent Dora's father's age as ""f"".  We know that his age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so: f = 2d + 8 
* **Dora's mother's age:** Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is f - 4.
* **Total age:**  We need to find the total age of Dora, her father, and her mother. This is: d + f + (f - 4)

**Now, let's plug in Dora's age:**

* We know Dora is 15 years old, so d = 15.
* Substitute this into the equation for her father's age: f = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
* Substitute this into the equation for her mother's age: f - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34

**Finally, calculate the total combined age:**

* Total age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

**Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87.**

"Let's break down the information:

* **Total votes:**  The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against it.
* **Council size:** There are 33 people on the council.

To find the number of votes in favor, we need to understand that the total votes are the sum of votes in favor and against.  

Let 'x' represent the number of votes against the regulation.  

* **Votes in favor:** 2x 
* **Total votes:** x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms: 3x = 33

Solving for x: x = 33 / 3 = 11

* **Votes in favor:** 2 * 11 = 22

**Therefore, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.** 


**22**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Size Small:** Krissa has twice as many students needing size small as extra-small, so she needs 11 * 2 = 22 size small shirts.
* **Size Medium:** She has four less students needing size medium than size small, so she needs 22 - 4 = 18 size medium shirts.
* **Size Large:** She has half as many students needing size large as size medium, so she needs 18 / 2 = 9 size large shirts.
* **Size Extra-Large:** She has six more students needing size extra-large than size large, so she needs 9 + 6 = 15 size extra-large shirts.
* **Total:**  To find the total number of shirts, add the number of shirts for each size: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 65 shirts.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as 'x'.**

* **The first house needs 1/2 of the second, so it needs x/2 cases.**

* **The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.**

* **The total number of cases needed is 250, so we can set up an equation:** x + x/2 + x = 250

* **Combine like terms:** (5/2)x = 250

* **Multiply both sides by 2/5:** x = 100

* **The second house needs 100 cases of shingles.**

* **The third house needs 100 cases of shingles.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of zest Tanya uses.**
* **Since she uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, she uses x ounces of fragrance.**
* **She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * salt ounces of oil.**
* **She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so she uses x ounces of salt.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos:**  We know the speed of a kangaroo is the base for our calculation.
* **Turtles:** The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo.
* **Time:** The time it takes to travel is directly related to the speed and distance.

**Calculations**

1. **Kangaroo Speed:**  Let's assume the speed of a kangaroo is 'x' miles per hour.
2. **Turtle Speed:** The speed of a turtle is 'x/2' miles per hour.
3. **Distance:** The distance is the same for both groups.
4. **Time:**  We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

**Solving for Time**

* **Kangaroos:** 18 hours = Distance / x
* **Turtles:**  Let 't' be the time it takes for the turtles.  We have: t = Distance / (x/2)

**Finding the Relationship**

Since the distance is the same for both groups, we can equate the two equations:

18 hours = Distance / x = Distance / (x/2)

**Simplifying**

* 18 hours = Distance / x = Distance * 2 / x

**Solving for Time**

* 18 hours = 2 * Distance / x
* 18 hours * x = 2 * Distance

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Jack's dishes:** Jack collected 60 dishes.
* **Peter's socks:** Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 2 * 60 = 120 socks.
* **Jack's socks:** Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, meaning Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
* **Total socks:** Peter has 120 socks, and Jack has 30 socks, for a total of 120 + 30 = 150 socks.
* **Total dishes:** Jack has 60 dishes, and Peter has 120 socks, for a total of 60 + 120 = 180 dishes.

**Therefore, together they have 150 socks and 180 dishes.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let your age be represented by ""x""
    * Your brother's age is ""x + 3""
    * Your sister's age is ""x - 2""

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The sum of our ages is 87:  x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87

* **Solve the equation:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Melanie's current age:**  Let Melanie's current age be represented by the variable 'x'.
* **In 10 years:** In 10 years, Melanie will be x + 10 years old.
* **Thrice her present age:**  Thrice her present age is 3x.
* **The equation:** We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, so: x + 10 = 18
* **Solving for x:**  Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: x = 8
* **Finding the time:** Melanie is currently 8 years old.  To find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 3 * 8 = 24.
* **Calculating the time:**  Since Melanie is currently 8 years old, it will take 24 - 8 = 16 years for her age to be thrice her present age.

"Let's break down the information:

* **Thingamabob speed:**  We know a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob.
* **Whatchamacallit speed:** We know a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
* **Whirligig speed:** A whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob.

To find the whirligig's speed, we can use the following logic:

* If a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, and a whatchamacallit spins 121 meters per second, then the thingamabob spins at 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.

* **Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:**  This means Peter's age is (John's age + 10) + John's age.

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  Let's use this information to solve for John's age.

**Let's represent the ages:**

* John's age:  *J*
* Paul's age: *J + 10*
* Peter's age: *(J + 10) + J*

**Now, we can set up an equation:**

(J + (J + 10) + J) = 100

**Simplify and solve for J:**

3J + 10 = 100
3J = 90
J = 30

**Now that we know John's age (J = 30), we can find Paul's age:**

Paul's age = J + 10 = 30 + 10 = 40

**Finally, we can find Peter's age:**

Peter's age = (J + 10) + J = 30 + 10 + 30 = 70

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips the other two people received.**
* **They received 15 more than x, so they received x + 15.**
* **The total number of corn chips received by the three people is 70 + 70 + (x + 15).**
* **We know that the total number of corn chips is equal to the number of people receiving corn chips.**

**Therefore, we can set up an equation:**

70 + 70 + (x + 15) = 2 * (x + 15)

**Solving for x:**

* 155 + x + 15 = 2x + 30

    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Simplify: 2S + W + 5 = 339
    * Substitute S = 4W - 13 into the equation: 2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 21 = 339
    * Add 21 to both sides: 9W = 360
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40 

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute W = 40 into the equation for S: S = 4(40) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 160 - 13
    * Calculate: S = 147

**Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled south.**
   * Distance = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

* **Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled north.**
   * Distance = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

* **Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled south again.**
   * Distance = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

* **Step 4: Calculate the total distance.**
   * Total Distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

**Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles.**

    * Since the comet orbits every 75 years, we know the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years. 
    * We can use the equation b = 3f to find the value of 'f'
    *  We know that Bill's age is 30 years old, so we can substitute that into the equation b = 3f to find the value of 'f'
    *  We can then use the value of 'f' to find the age Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Buford writes 12 checks per year. 

Here's the breakdown:

* Monthly: 1 (electric) + 1 (gas) = 2 checks
* Quarterly: 1 (pest/lawn) = 1 check
* Total: 2 + 1 = 3 checks per month
* Total checks per year: 3 checks/month * 12 months = 36 checks

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **First plane's flights:** Let's say the first plane makes 'x' number of flights in a day.
* **Greece flights:** It flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* **France and Germany flights:** The remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each destination gets (1/4x)/2 = (1/8)x flights.
* **Second plane's flights:** The second plane flies to Poland, and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44/2 = 22 trips.

**Therefore, the first plane makes (3/4)x flights to Greece, and the remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany. The second plane makes 22 trips to Poland.**

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.** 
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, meaning it had 9% of its capacity left after 5 hours.
   - Let's assume the initial charge was 'x'. After 5 hours, the remaining charge is 0.9x.
* **Step 2: Calculate the charge after 5 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 0.9x remaining after 5 hours.
* **Step 3: Calculate the charge after 8 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, meaning it had 7% of its capacity left after 3 hours.
   - Let's assume the initial charge was 'x'. After 8 hours, the remaining charge is 0.9x.

"Here's how to break down the probabilities:

* **Probability of substitute teacher:** 50%
* **Probability of no extension with normal teacher:** 60% (100% - 40%)
* **Probability of Marcus getting an extension:** 20%
* **Probability of Marcus getting an extension regardless of teacher:** 20%

To find the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the possible scenarios:

* **Substitute teacher:** 50% chance of no extension, 20% chance of Marcus getting an extension.
* **Normal teacher:** 40% chance of no extension, 20% chance of Marcus getting an extension.

**Calculating the overall probability:**

* **Scenario 1:** Substitute teacher, no extension: 0.50 * 0.60 = 0.30
* **Scenario 2:** Substitute teacher, extension: 0.50 * 0.20 = 0.10
* **Scenario 3:** Normal teacher, no extension: 0.40 * 0.60 = 0.24
* **Scenario 4:** Normal teacher, extension: 0.40 * 0.20 = 0.08

**Total probability:** 0.30 + 0.10 + 0.24 + 0.08 = **0.72**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Xavier's new height:** Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches.
* **Cole's new height:** Cole grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.
* **The difference:** The difference between Cole's and Xavier's new heights is 52 inches - 4 feet 3 inches. 

To convert feet to inches, we know 1 foot = 12 inches. So, 4 feet 3 inches is equal to 4 * 12 + 3 = 51 inches.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount the first person received.
    * The second person received 'x + $80'.
    * The third person received '2 * (x + $80)'.

* **Total amount:** The total amount received by all three is $1920.  So, we can write the equation: 
   x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

* **Solve the equation:**
    * x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920
    * 4x + $240 = $1920
    * 4x = $1680

* **Allosaurus's meal:** The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, meaning the remaining weight was 270 kilograms.

Let's break it down:

1. **T-Rex's meal:**  Let's call the original weight of the triceratops ""x"".  The T-Rex ate 1/2 * x.
2. **Velociraptors' meal:** The velociraptors ate 1/2 * (1/2 * x) = 1/4 * x.

x = 270 * 4
x = 1080

**Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.**

**1. Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**

* Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

**2. Calculate Lauren's annual living expenses:**

* She plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

**3. Calculate Lauren's annual savings after living expenses:**

* Her annual savings are $20,000, and her annual living expenses are $40,000, so she has $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 left for other expenses.

**4. Calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save:**

* She wants to save for 20 years, and her annual savings are $20,000.  Therefore, she needs to save $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

**5. Calculate the number of years to reach her savings goal:**

* She needs to save $400,000 and her current savings are $60,000.  Therefore, she needs to save $400,000 - $60,000 = $340,000 more.
* She saves $20,000 per year, so it will take her $340,000 / $20,000 = 17 years to reach her goal.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
    * Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2x seashells.
    * Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

* **Total shells:**  The total number of shells is the sum of what each person collected: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5

* **Dividing equally:** They divided the total shells equally, so each person got (5x + 5) / 3 shells.

* **Solving for x:** We know Jim collected 27 shells, so 2x + 5 = 27.  Solving for x:
    * 2x = 22
    * x = 11

* **Calculating the number of shells each person got:**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

* **Blue rope length:** The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.

* **Red rope length:** The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.

* **Combined length:** The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so: x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 6x - 28 = 37
    * Add 28 to both sides: 6x = 65
    * Divide both sides by 6: x = 10.83 (approximately)

* **Find the length of the red rope:** 
    * Red rope length = 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (10.83 - 7) = 4 * 3.83 = 15.32 (approximately)

**Therefore, the length of the red rope is approximately 15.32 centimeters.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the amount of money Ronnie had:**  Let Ronnie's initial amount be represented by 'x'.
* **Rissa's initial amount:** Rissa had thrice the amount Ronnie had, so she had 3x.
* **Money given to their sister:**  Both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount to their sister. Let's call this amount 'y'.
* **Rissa's remaining amount:** After giving money, Rissa has 4/5 of her initial amount, which is (3x) - y.
* **Setting up the equation:** We know that Rissa has 4/5 of her money left, so we can write the equation: (3x) - y = (4/5) * 3x

**Solving for y:**
1. Simplify the equation: 3x - y = (12/5)x
2. Subtract 3x from both sides: -y = (12/5)x - 3x
3. Combine like terms: -y = (3/5)x
4. Solve for y: y = (-5/3)x

**Finding Ronnie's remaining amount:**
* **Ronnie's initial amount:** x
* **Money given to their sister:** y = (-5/3)x
* **Ronnie's remaining amount:** x - y = x - (-5/3)x = (8/3)x

**Final answer:** The amount left in Ronnie's money is **(8/3)x**.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be 'w'**
* **Let Colin's current age be 'c'**

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25) / 3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Substitute the value of 'w' from the first equation into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = ((5(c + 7) + 25) / 3)

2. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   c + 25 = (5c + 35 + 25) / 3
   c + 25 = (5c + 60) / 3
   3c + 75 = 5c + 60
   15 = 2c
   c = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Test tubes:** Igor gathered half the requested number of test tubes, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** Igor gathered 2 more than the requested number of Petri dishes, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total items:** Igor had 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.
* **Beakers:** We know Igor had 29 items in total, and he had 24 items already, so he lost 29 - 24 = 5 beakers.


**Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Vanessa's speed:** Vanessa ran 4 miles, and since she ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran 2 miles.
* **Aaron's speed:** Aaron ran 16 minutes for 2 miles, so his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.
* **Vanessa's speed:** Vanessa's speed is 4 miles / Vanessa's time. 
* **Vanessa's time:**  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.  

Let's calculate Vanessa's time:

Vanessa's time = 4 miles / (0.125 miles/minute) = 32 minutes.

"This question is about the time it takes to peel oranges and the number of oranges peeled, not about the efficiency of the individuals.  

Here's how to approach the problem:

* **Individual peeling time:** Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes.
* **Total oranges peeled:**  We need to know how many oranges are in the basket to determine the difference in oranges peeled.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
