* **Understand the ratio:** The ratio 7:13 means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.
* **Use the total ratio parts:**  We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar, which represents 7 parts of the ratio.
* **Calculate the value of one part:**  To find the value of one part, divide the total teaspoons of sugar by the number of parts: 120 teaspoons / 7 parts = 17.14 teaspoons per part.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, so in 4 minutes, they lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the pool sizes:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, meaning it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Ruby's current age be ""R""**
* **Let Sam's current age be ""S""**

We know:

* **R = 6S** (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **R + 9 = 3(S + 9)** (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for S (Sam's current age):

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** 
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the speed of the car in the slow lane:**

* The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, so it's traveling at 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

**2. Use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time**

* We know the distance (480 miles) and the speed of the car in the fast lane.  We can use this to find the time it took.

**3. Solve for time:**

"Let's break down the information:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

"Here's how to break down the calculation:

**Step 1: Calculate the time for the initial leg of the trip.**

* Distance: 200 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the time for the detour.**

* Distance: 10 miles

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.**
* **Four times the number of mask refusals is 4x.**
* **Five less than four times the number of mask refusals is 4x - 5.**
* **This number represents the people kicked out for shoplifting.**
* **Three times the number of shoplifters is 3(4x - 5).**
* **The total number of people kicked out is x + 4x - 5 + 3(4x - 5) = 50**

Now, let's solve for x:

* **Combine like terms: 9x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50**
* **Combine like terms: 21x - 20 = 50**
* **Add 20 to both sides: 21x = 70**
* **Divide both sides by 21: x = 3.33**

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to consider the context of the problem.  It's likely there's a rounding error in the problem statement.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.**

* **David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.**

* **Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.**

* **Together they found 43 insects, so x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43**

* **Combine like terms: 3x/2 + 7 = 43**

* **Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x/2 = 36**

* **Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 72**

* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 24**

* **David found x/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.**

* **Lily found (x/2) + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.**


**Therefore, Lily found 19 insects.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of blue jelly beans.**

* **Red jelly beans:** The jar has 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so there are 0.9x red jelly beans.

* **Green jelly beans:** The jar has 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so there are 1.01x green jelly beans.

* **Total jelly beans:**  The total number of jelly beans is x + 0.9x + 1.01x = 2.91x

* **We know the total is 4500:** 2.91x = 4500

* **Solve for x:** x = 4500 / 2.91 
   * x ≈ 1560.7 

* **Since we can't have a fraction of jelly beans, we need to adjust our thinking.**  Let's assume the note is a bit off.  

* **Let's try a different approach:**  We know the ratio of red to blue jelly beans is 1:1.  This means that if we have 100 jelly beans, there are 100 red and 100 blue.  

* **Let's use this to find the number of green jelly beans:**  Since the ratio of green to blue jelly beans is 1.01:1, we can say that for every 100 jelly beans, there are 1.01 green jelly beans.  

* **Calculate the number of green jelly beans:**  Since the total number of jelly beans is 4500, we can calculate the number of green jelly beans by multiplying the number of blue jelly beans by 1.01.


**Final Answer:** 4500 jelly beans.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Lynn's distance be represented by ""L""
    * Paisley's distance is ""P""
    * Reggie's distance is ""R""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P = 4 miles (Paisley's distance)
    * R = 5P + 3 (Reggie's distance is 5 times Paisley's and 3 miles farther)
    * L + P + R = Total distance (Lynn, Paisley, and Reggie's combined distance)

* **Substitute the value of P into the equation for R:**
    * R = 5 * 4 + 3 = 23 miles

* **Now we can find Lynn's distance (L):**
    * L + 4 + 23 = Total distance
    * L + 27 = Total distance
    * L = Total distance - 27

* **We need to find the total distance to solve for L.**  We know that the total distance is the sum of the distances of all three runners.  We know that Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 23 miles, and we need to find Lynn's distance.  

* **Therefore, we can find Lynn's distance by substituting the values of P and R into the equation for L:**
    * L = Total distance - 27
    * L = (4 + 23) - 27
    * L = 27 - 27
    * L = 0 miles

**Answer:** Lynn ran 0 miles.

"To calculate the time it takes to dig the hole, we need to consider the volume of the hole.  

The volume of a rectangular prism (like a hole) is calculated by:

Volume = length x width x depth

In this case:

Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet = 72 cubic feet

Since Bob shovels 1 cubic foot every 3 seconds, we can calculate the total time:

Time = Volume / Shovel Rate

Time = 72 cubic feet / 3 seconds/cubic foot = 24 seconds

**Therefore, it will take Bob 24 seconds to dig the hole.**

We know:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way:

"Here's how to break down the cost:

* **Shipping cost:** 
    * Weight: 4 pounds
    * Cost per pound: $0.35
    * Total shipping cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
    * Distance: 20 miles
    * Cost per mile: $0.08
    * Total mileage cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Week 2:** Boris produces half of the first week's output, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:** Boris produces three times the output of the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:**  8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:**  To find the output for week 4, we need to subtract the total from the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Anthony's savings:** Anthony has $10.00 more than Eva, who saved $20.00, so Anthony saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

2. **Roy's savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, who saved $30.00.  To find Roy's savings, we need to calculate 40% of $30.00. 
   * 40% of $30.00 = (40/100) * $30.00 = $12.00

3. **Roy's total savings:** Roy saved $12.00 more than Anthony, so he saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos' speed:**  Let's assume a kangaroo travels at a speed of 'x' miles per hour.
* **Turtles' speed:** Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is 'x/2' miles per hour.

**Calculating the Time**

* **Kangaroos' distance:**  Since they travel together, the time is directly proportional to the distance.
* **Turtles' time:**  We need to find the time it takes for four turtles to cover the same distance.

**Setting up the Equation**

* **Kangaroos' total distance:**  They travel for 18 hours at a speed of 'x' miles per hour.
* **Turtles' total distance:**  They also travel for 't' hours at a speed of 'x/2' miles per hour.

**Solving for 't'**

* **Kangaroos' distance:**  Distance = Speed * Time, so 18 hours * x = Distance
* **Turtles' distance:**  Distance = Speed * Time, so Distance = (x/2) * t

**Finding the Relationship**

* **Distance is the same:**  The distance covered by the kangaroos and the turtles is the same. 
* **Setting up the equation:**  18 hours * x = (x/2) * t

**Solving for 't'**

* **Simplifying the equation:**  36 hours = 1/2 * t
* **Solving for 't':**  t = 72 hours

**Answer:** It will take **72 hours** for four turtles to travel the same distance.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Bill's current age be 'b'
    * Let his father's age be 'f' when Bill saw the comet the first time.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Halley orbits every 75 years.
    * Bill saw the comet when he was 30 years old. This means his father was 30 - f years old when Bill saw the comet.
    * Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the comet the first time. This means Bill was 3 * (30 - f) years old when he saw the comet the second time.

* **Use the information about Halley's orbit:**
    * The problem states that Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. This means the time between each orbit is constant.

* **Igneous' howl:** Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time is 60 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Convert to minutes:** There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the total howl time is 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Father's gift:** Adam's father gave him twice the amount his mother gave him, so he received 2 * $6 = $12.
* **Total from gifts:** Adam received a total of $6 + $12 = $18 from his gifts.
* **Adam's savings:**  To find out how much he contributed from his savings, subtract the total from his gifts from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

**Answer:** $12

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.  We know the total age is 20 and there are 4 children.
2. **Find Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so her age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.
3. **Set up an equation:** We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.  Let's call Wilfred's age 'x'.  We can now write an equation:
   (3 + 4 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20
4. **Solve for Helene's age:**  We can simplify the equation to:
   (7 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20
   7 + Helene's age + x = 80
   Helene's age + x = 73
5. **Solve for x:** We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.  We can substitute the value of Helene's age from step 4 into this equation.
   Helene's age + x = 73
   2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age) / 4 + x = 73
   We know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4.  We can substitute these values into the equation.
   2 * (3 + 4 + Wilfred's age) / 4 + x = 73
   2 * (7 + Wilfred's age) / 4 + x = 73
   7 + Wilfred's age + x = 73
   Wilfred's age + x = 66

"Here's how to calculate the car's price in 2010:

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $20,000 * 0.21 = $4,200.  The car's value is now $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $15,800 * 0.21 = $3,278.  The car's value is now $15,800 - $3,278 = $12,522.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12,522, which is $12,522 * 0.21 = $2,554.22. The car's value is now $12,522 - $2,554.22 = $9,967.78.

**Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,967.78.**

"To calculate the cost of your kitchen floor renovation, we need to determine the number of tiles needed and then multiply that by the cost per tile. 

First, we need to find the area of your kitchen floor in square feet. You've already provided that it's 200 square feet.

Next, we need to determine the area of one tile. You've stated that each tile is 1 foot in length.  

Finally, we can calculate the number of tiles needed by dividing the total area of your kitchen floor by the area of one tile. 

**Here's the calculation:**

* **Area of one tile:** 1 square foot
* **Total area of kitchen floor:** 200 square feet
* **Number of tiles:** 200 square feet / 1 square foot/tile = 200 tiles

**Cost of tiles:** 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate daily energy demand:**

* Each person needs 20% of their daily energy demand from a juice.
* Total daily energy demand for 2300 people is 2300 * 0.20 = 460 units.

**2. Calculate the total bottles needed:**

* Hortex needs to produce enough juice to cover 460 units of energy.
* Total bottles needed is 460 / 0.20 = 2300 bottles.

**3. Calculate the difference:**

* Hortex needs to produce 2300 bottles to meet the energy needs of 2300 people. 
* They already produce 4200 bottles, so they need to produce 2300 - 4200 = -1900 more bottles.

"Let's break down the information and solve for the length of the red rope:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**
* **The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.**
* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.**

**The combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:**
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Now, let's solve for x:**
x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

**The yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.**

**The blue rope is 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters long.**

**The red rope is 4 * (12 - 7) = 28 centimeters long.**


**Therefore, the length of the red rope is 28 centimeters.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the amount of money Rissa had:**  Let 'x' be the amount of money Rissa had initially.
* **Rissa's money after giving to her sister:**  Rissa gave away x/3 of her money.
* **Ronnie's money after giving to her sister:** Ronnie gave away 5/1 of her money.
* **Rissa's remaining money:**  Rissa has 4/5 of her original amount, which can be written as (4/5)x.
* **Rissa's original amount:** We know that Rissa had (4/5)x, and she gave away x/3, so we can set up an equation: (4/5)x = (x/3)
* **Solving for x:**  Multiply both sides by 15 to get rid of the fractions: 12x = 5x
* **Solving for x:**  Subtract 5x from both sides: 7x = 0
* **Finding Rissa's original amount:**  Divide both sides by 7: x = 0.


**Therefore, Rissa had $0 initially.** 

**Ronnie's money:**  Since Rissa gave away 0, Ronnie's money is the same as the amount she gave away. 


**Final answer:** 0

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be ""W""**
* **Let Colin's current age be ""C""**

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  W = 5(C + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** C + 25 = (W + 25)/3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

**Step 1: Solve for W in terms of C in the first equation:**

W = 5(C + 7)
W = 5C + 35

**Step 2: Substitute this value of W into the second equation:**

C + 25 = ((5C + 35) + 25)/3

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for C:**

C + 25 = (5C + 60)/3
3C + 75 = 5C + 60
15 = 2C
C = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Three times the number of cupcakes is 3x.**
* **Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, so she made 3x - 2 brownies.**
* **Carly made a total of 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.**
* **We know the total number of brownies and cupcakes is 10 treats.**

**Let's use the information about brownies to solve for x:**

* **Carly made 3x - 2 brownies.**
* **We know the number of brownies is equal to the number of cupcakes.**
* **Therefore, 3x - 2 = x**

**Solve for x:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
   * Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  S = K + 8  (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
   *  S = 27 - 12 (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)

* **Solve for Kim's paintings (K):**
   * Since S = K + 8 and S = 27 - 12, we can substitute the first equation into the second:
     * (K + 8) = 27 - 12
     * K + 8 = 15

* **Calculate the profit:** 25% of $80 is (25/100) * $80 = $20
* **Add the profit to the original cost:** The total cost of the watermelons was $80, and the profit was $20, so the selling price was $80 + $20 = $100.
* **Divide the selling price by the number of watermelons:** Each watermelon was sold for $100 / 50 = $2.

**Answer:** $2

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.**


**Answer: 5**
