"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Green House:** Melanie sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the greenhouse.  Let's represent the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with as ""x"".  She sold (1/3)x.
* **Red House:** She sold 2 more to the red house, so she had x - (1/3)x = (2/3)x left.
* **Orange House:** She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house.  This means she sold (1/2) * (2/3)x = (1/3)x at the orange house.
* **Total Sold:**  The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is (1/3)x + 2 + (1/3)x = (2/3)x + 2
* **Remaining:** She has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so (2/3)x + 2 = 5
* **Solve for x:** 
    * Subtract 2 from both sides: (2/3)x = 3
    * Multiply both sides by 3: 2x = 9
    * Divide both sides by 2: x = 4.5

**Therefore, Melanie started with 4.5 vacuum cleaners.**

"Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Watermelon cost:** Since a watermelon costs three times the price of a pepper, let's represent the cost of a pepper as 'x'.  The cost of a watermelon is then 3x.
* **Orange cost:** An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so it costs 3x - 5.
* **Total cost:**

"Here's how to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months:

**Understanding the Growth Pattern**

The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This is an exponential growth pattern.  

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate the growth factor:** 1 + (20/100) = 1.20 (The price increases by 20% of the original price, so the growth factor is 1.20)

2. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   * Month 1: $20 * 1.20 = $24
   * Month 2: $24 * 1.20 = $28.80
   * Month 3: $28.80 * 1.20 = $34.56
   * ... and so on

3. **Calculate the price after 36 months:**  We can use a formula to simplify this.  The price after *n* months is:

   Price after *n* months = $20 * (1.20)^n

4. **Plug in the value of *n*:** Price after 36 months = $20 * (1.20)^36

**Using a calculator:**

You can use a calculator to find the final price.  

**Final Answer:**

The price of the bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately **$100.80**

"Let's break down this problem using algebra:

* Let Seth's current age be represented by the variable ""S""
* Let Brooke's current age be represented by the variable ""B""

We know:

* S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   (2B) + B + 2 = 28

2. **Simplify and solve for B:**
   3B + 2 = 28
   3B = 26
   B = 26/3 

3. **Substitute the value of B back into the first equation to find S:**
   S = 2 * (26/3)
   S = 52/3

4. **Simplify the answer:**
   S = 17.33 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.33 years old.**

* **The total eggs from white chickens is 5(r + 2).**
* **The total eggs from both types of chickens is 42.**

Now we can set up an equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

**Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.**

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool initially.
* The big pool initially had twice the water of the small pool, so it had 2x gallons.

**2. Set up the Equations:**

* **After 4 minutes:** The big pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.  The big pool now has 2x - 16 gallons.

"Let's break down this problem using algebra:

* Let Carver's son's age be represented by the variable ""s"".
* We know Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, so we can write this as an equation: 2s - 5 = Carver's age

* We know Carver's age is 45, so we can substitute that into the equation: 2s - 5 = 45

* Now, solve for ""s"" (the son's age):

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Joanne's apples from the shortest trees:** Joanne gathered half the number of apples from the tallest trees, so she gathered 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Joanne's apples from the average trees:**  She gathered more apples from the average trees than the shortest trees, so let's call the number of apples from the average trees ""x"".
* **Joanne's total apples:** Joanne gathered 30 + 15 + x apples.
* **Sister's apples from the tallest trees:** Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 30 * 2 = 60 apples.
* **Sister's apples from the shortest trees:** She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 15 * 3 = 45 apples.
* **Total apples gathered by the sister:** The sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples.
* **Combined total:** The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, so Joanne's apples plus her sister's apples equals 500.  We can set up an equation: 30 + 15 + x + 105 = 500
* **Solving for x:** Combine the known apples and simplify the equation: 15 + x + 135 = 500.  
* **Solving for x:** Subtract 135 from both sides: x + 150 = 500.  
* **Solving for x:** Subtract 150 from both sides: x = 350.

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
   360 - 2d + d = 304
   -d = -56
   d = 56

**Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.**

"Let's break down the cost of each venue:

**Venue 1:**

* Flat fee: $200
* Food cost per guest: $5
* Total cost per guest: $200 + ($5 * number of guests)

**Venue 2:**

* Cost per guest: $25
* Food included, so no additional cost

**Setting up the equation:**

To find the point where the cost is equal, we need to set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + ($5 * number of guests) = $25 * number of guests

**Solving for the number of guests:**

1. Simplify the equation: $200 + 5*number of guests = 25*number of guests
2. Subtract 5*number of guests from both sides: $200 = 20*number of guests
3. Divide both sides by 20: number of guests = 10

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using algebra:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.**

* **David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.**

* **Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.**

* **Together they found 43 insects, so x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43**

* **Combine like terms: (5x/2) + 7 = 43**

* **Subtract 7 from both sides: (5x/2) = 36**

* **Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72**

* **Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4**

* **Since we can't have a fraction of an insect, we need to adjust our assumption.  Let's assume Bodhi found 14 insects.**

* **David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found 14/2 = 7 insects.**

"Here's how to solve this optimization problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of 2x4 pieces Frederick buys.
* Let 'y' represent the number of 2x8 pieces Frederick buys.

**2. Set Up the Constraints:**

* **Wood Cost:** 4x + 6y ≤ 24 (The total cost of wood cannot exceed $24)
* **Sticks:** 2x + 8y ≥ 400 (The total number of sticks must be at least 400)
* **Non-negativity:** x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Frederick can't buy negative quantities of wood)

**3.  Find the Optimal Solution:**

To find the most popsicle sticks he can make, we need to find the combination of 'x' and 'y' that satisfies the constraints and maximizes the number of sticks.  This is a classic linear programming problem.  

* **Graphing the Constraints:**  You can graph the constraints on a coordinate plane. This will help visualize the feasible region, which is the area where all the constraints are satisfied.
* **Finding the Corner Points:**  Identify the corner points of the feasible region. These are the points where the lines representing the constraints intersect.
* **Evaluating the Objective Function:**  At each corner point, calculate the number of sticks (2x + 8y) to determine which combination yields the maximum number of sticks.

**4. The Answer:**

After solving the problem, you'll find the optimal solution.  This will tell you the number of 2x4 and 2x8 pieces Frederick should buy to maximize his popsicle stick production while staying within his budget. 


**Note:**  This process involves a bit of algebra and graph plotting.  You can use online tools or software to help with the calculations and visualization.

* **Jenna's chairs:** Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 3c chairs.
* **Ophelia's sofas:** We know Ophelia has 20 sofas.
* **Setting up the equation:** We can now write an equation to represent the relationship between the number of chairs and sofas:
   * c - 2 = 20 
* **Solving for chairs:**  Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
   * c = 22
* **Jenna's sofas:** Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 3 * 22 = 66 sofas.
* **Total sofas and chairs:**  Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 66 sofas, for a total of 20 + 66 = 86 sofas and chairs.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of CDs Tom could have bought.

**2. Set up the equation:**

* The cost of the CDs is 4x (since each CD costs $4).
* The cost of the headphone set is unknown, but we know the total cost is $48.
* Therefore, the equation is: 4x + cost of headphones = $48

**3.  Find the cost of the headphone set:**

* We know the total cost is $48, and Tom spent $4 on the CDs.
* So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44

**4.  Solve for the number of CDs:**

* The cost of the headphone set is $44.
* We know each CD costs $4.
* Therefore, Tom could have bought x = $44 / $4 = 11 CDs.

**Answer:** Tom could have bought 11 more CDs.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding Exponential Growth:** The beanstalk's height is growing exponentially, meaning it doubles each day. 
* **Finding the Target Height:** We need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to reach 20 feet (the height of Mark's window).
* **Using the Exponential Growth Formula:**  The general formula for exponential growth is: 
   * A = P * (2)^(t/d) 
   * Where:
      * A = the final amount (20 feet)
      * P = the initial amount (4 feet)
      * t = the time (days)
      * d = the growth factor (in this case, 2, as it doubles each day)

* **Solving for t:**
   * 20 = 4 * (2)^(t/1)
   * 5 = 2^(t/1)
   * 2.5 = 2^t 
   * Since 2.5 is 2 raised to the power of 1.25, we can solve for t. 

* **Calculating the Number of Days:**  
   * t = log2(2.5) 
   * t ≈ 1.25 days

**Therefore, it will take approximately 1.25 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.** 


**Final Answer:** 1.25

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the sales from green hats in the first month:**

* Ariadne earned half the amount from green hats as red hats, so she made $400 / 2 = $200 from green hats.

**2. Calculate the total sales in the first month:**

* Ariadne's total sales in the first month were $400 (red hats) + $200 (green hats) = $600.

**3. Calculate the sales in the second month:**

* Her sales in the second month were 3/4 of the first month's sales, so she made (3/4) * $600 = $450 in the second month.

**4. Calculate the total sales over two months:**

* Her total sales over two months were $600 (month 1) + $450 (month 2) = $1050.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Legs:** Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs.
* **Heads:**  Each sheep and goose has one head.

**Setting up the Equations**

Let:
*  's' represent the number of sheep
*  'g' represent the number of geese

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

*  4s + 2g = 70 (total legs)
*  s + g = 20 (total heads)

**Solving for Sheep**

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using the second equation:

1.  s = 20 - g

**Substituting into the First Equation**

Substitute this value of 's' into the first equation:

* 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

**Solving for 'g'**

* 80 - 4g + 2g = 70
* -2g = -10
* g = 5

**Finding 's'**

Now that we know 'g' (the number of geese) is 5, substitute it back into either of the original equations to find 's'. Let's use s = 20 - g:

* s = 20 - 5
* s = 15

**Answer:** There are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of zest Tanya uses.** 
* **Since she uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, she uses 'x' ounces of fragrance.**
* **She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * salt ounces of oil.**
* **She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so she uses 'x' ounces of sugar.**
* **We know she uses 10 ounces total.**

**Now let's express the amounts in terms of 'x':**

* Oil = 2 * salt 
* Salt = x
* Zest = x
* Sugar = x

**We can now set up an equation:**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using algebra:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.**

* **Smendrick has 3 times PJ's cards:**  Smendrick has 3x cards.

* **Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:** Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Total cards:** The total number of cards is the sum of Becca's, Smendrick's, and PJ's cards: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

**Now, let's solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341
2. Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
3. Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

**Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's cards:**

* Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

**Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.**

"Here's how to solve this problem using proportional reasoning:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos and Time:**  The number of kangaroos and the time it takes them to travel are directly related.  
* **Turtles and Speed:** The number of turtles and the time it takes them to travel are also related.

**Setting up the Proportion**

Let's use a variable to represent the speed of a kangaroo:

* Let 'k' be the speed of a kangaroo.
* The time it takes 3 kangaroos to travel is 18 hours.

We can set up a proportion:

* 3 kangaroos * k = 18 hours

**Finding the Speed of a Turtle**

* The speed of a turtle is half that of a kangaroo, so the turtle's speed is k/2.

**Calculating the Time for Four Turtles**

* The time it takes four turtles to travel is the time it takes one kangaroo to travel. 
* We can use the proportion to find the time for four turtles: 
    * 4 turtles * (k/2) = 18 hours

**Solving for the Time**

* 2 turtles * k = 18 hours
* k = 18 hours / 2 turtles
* k = 9 hours/turtle

**Final Answer**

* 4 turtles * (k/2) = 18 hours
* 4 turtles * (9 hours/turtle) = 36 hours 


**Therefore, it will take 36 hours for four turtles to travel across the highway.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
    * Let Paul's age be represented by 'P' + 10 
    * Let John's age be represented by 'J'

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P + P + J = 100  (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100)
    * P = P + 10 + J  (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for P (Peter's age):**
    * Simplify the second equation: P = P + 10 + J
    * Subtract P from both sides: 0 = 10 + J

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Dinar's score be represented by 'd'
    * Let Azibo's score be represented by 'a'
    * Let Bahati's score be represented by 'b'

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  b = a + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
    *  b = d + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
    *  a + d + b = 45 (The total points scored by all three)

* **Solve for 'a' (Azibo's score):**
    * Since we know b = a + 20 and b = d + 10, we can substitute to find 'a':
        *  d + 10 = a + 20
        *  a = d - 10 
    * Now, substitute this value of 'a' into the equation for 'b':
        * b = (d - 10) + 20
        * b = d + 10
    * We know b = d + 10 and b = a + 20, so we can set them equal to each other:
        * d + 10 = a + 20
        * d + 10 = (d - 10) + 20
        * d + 10 = d + 10
    * This equation is true for any value of 'd'.  

* **We need more information to solve for 'a'** 

**Final Answer:** We cannot determine the exact number of points Azibo scored with the information provided.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips the other two people received.**
* **They received 15 more than x, so they received x + 15.**
* **The total number of corn chips received by the two people is 2x + (x + 15) = 3x + 15**
* **Amora and Lainey received a total of 70 chips, so 3x + 15 = 70**
* **Solving for x: 3x = 55**
* **Therefore, x = 18.33**

**Since we can't have a fraction of a corn chip, we need to adjust our assumption. Let's assume the number of corn chips the other two people received is 18.**

* **The other two people received 18 corn chips each.**
* **The total number of corn chips received by the other two people is 2 * 18 = 36**
* **The total number of corn chips received by the three people is 36 + 15 = 51**

**Therefore, there were a total of 51 corn chips.**

* **The cost of the tickets is $0.**


**Therefore, the travel cost is $0.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using algebra:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.**

* **Stan's Pokemon:** Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch: 4x - 13

* **Alex's Pokemon:** Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: 4x - 13 + 5

* **Total Pokemon:** The total number of Pokemon caught is the sum of their catches: x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

* **Simplify and solve for x:** 9x - 21 = 339
   * Add 21 to both sides: 9x = 360
   * Divide both sides by 9: x = 40

* **Stan's Pokemon:** Stan caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.


**Answer:** Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Calculate the first plane's total flights:**  Let 'x' represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
* **Flights to Greece:** The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so it flies to Greece (3/4)x flights.
* **Flights to France and Germany:** The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of these destinations gets (1/2) * (x - (3/4)x) flights.
* **Flights to Poland:** The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips represent half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44 / 2 = 22 flights.

**Let's break down the information:**

* **First plane:**  We know the first plane makes 'x' flights in a day.
* **Greece:** (3/4)x flights
* **France and Germany:** (1/2) * (x - (3/4)x) flights
* **Poland:** 22 flights

**To find the number of flights to France, we need to find the value of 'x'.**

**Let's use the information about the other plane:**

* The other plane makes 22 flights to Poland.
* This means the other plane makes 22 * 2 = 44 flights in total.
* The other plane makes half the number of flights the first plane makes, so the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 flights.

**Now we can solve for 'x':**

* The first plane makes 88 flights.
* (3/4)x = 88
* Multiply both sides by 4/3: x = 88 * (4/3)
* x = 116.67

**Since we can't have a fraction of a flight, we need to adjust our assumption.  Let's assume the first plane makes 117 flights in a day.**

* **Flights to Greece:** (3/4) * 117 = 88.5 flights
* **Flights to France and Germany:** (1/2) * (117 - 88.5) = 14.75 flights
* **Flights to Poland:** 22 flights

**The first plane makes 117 flights in a day.**

* Since the total age is 20 and there are 4 children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years.

**2. Calculate Helene's age:**

* Helene is twice as old as the average age, so she is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

**3. Calculate the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro:**

* Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7 years

**4. Calculate Wilfred's age:**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Initial Charge:** We need to find the initial charge of the power bank.
* **Loss Rate:** The power bank loses 9% of its charge per hour for the first 5 hours.
* **Change in Loss Rate:** The loss rate changes to 7% per hour after 5 hours.
* **Remaining Charge:** The power bank has 28% charge remaining after 8 hours.

**Calculations**

1. **First 5 hours:**  Let's assume the initial charge was 'x'. After 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge, so it has (0.91x) remaining. 

2. **Change in Loss Rate:** After 5 hours, the loss rate changes to 7% per hour.

3. **Remaining Charge After 5 Hours:** We know the power bank has 28% charge remaining after 8 hours.

**Solving for the Initial Charge**

* **Let's use a variable:** Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank.
* **Equation:** We can set up an equation to represent the remaining charge after 5 hours: 
   * 0.91x = 28% of the initial charge.
* **Convert percentage to decimal:** 28% = 0.28
* **Solve for x:** 
   * 0.91x = 0.28
   * x = 0.28 / 0.91 
   * x = 0.308 (approximately)

**Final Calculation**

* **Charge after 8 hours:** The power bank loses 7% of its charge per hour for 3 hours.
* **Charge after 8 hours:** 0.308 * 0.93 = 0.28 (approximately)


**Answer:** The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 0.308.

* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understand the relationship:**  We know that 40% of the school population is boys.  
* **Find the total population:** Since 240 boys represent 40% of the population, we can set up a proportion: 
   * 40/100 = 240/x  (where x is the total population)
* **Solve for x:** Cross-multiply: 40 * x = 240 * 100
* **Simplify:** 40x = 24000
* **Isolate x:** Divide both sides by 40: x = 600 
* **Find the number of girls:**  The total population is 600, and we know 40% are boys. Therefore, the number of girls is 600 - 240 = 360.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

The number of blinks per minute is a constant rate.  We can use this to find the time it takes to reach a specific number of blinks.

**Setting up the Proportion**

Let 'x' represent the time in minutes it takes to blink 459 times. We can set up a proportion:

* Blinks per minute = 255 / 5 minutes 
* Blinks per minute = 51

Now, we can set up the proportion:

* 51 blinks / 1 minute = 459 blinks / x minutes

**Solving for x**

To solve for 'x', cross-multiply:

* 51 * x = 459 * 1
* 51x = 459

Divide both sides by 51:

* x = 459 / 51
* x = 9 minutes

**Answer:** It will take the light **9 minutes** to blink 459 times.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let Liam's current age be ""L""
   * Let Vince's current age be ""V""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know L = 16 (Liam's current age)
   * Two years ago, Liam was L - 2 years old, and Vince was V - 2 years old. We're told this was twice Vince's age: L - 2 = 2(V - 2)

* **Solve for V (Vince's current age):**
   * Substitute the value of L (16) into the equation: 16 - 2 = 2(V - 2)
   * Simplify: 14 = 2V - 4
   * Add 4 to both sides: 18 = 2V
   * Divide both sides by 2: V = 9

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.**

* **Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs:**  This means we can write an equation:  Camden + Sarah = 30

* **Camden painted 12 more than Sarah:**  We can represent this as: Camden = Sarah + 12

* **Combine the equations:** We know that Arnold and Madeline painted 'x' eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs.  We can write this as: x + x = 56 

* **Solve for x:**  2x = 56
   * x = 28  (This means Arnold and Madeline each painted 28 eggs)

* **Find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:** Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so we need to find that difference. 
   * Camden = Sarah + 12
   * Since we know Sarah painted 'x' eggs, we can substitute: Camden = Sarah + 12 = 28 + 12 = 40

* **Calculate the difference:** Camden painted 40 eggs and Arnold painted 28 eggs. The difference is: 40 - 28 = 12

**Answer:** Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

    * Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2 * C seashells.
    * Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2 * C + 5 seashells.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of seashells is the sum of what each person collected: 
   C + 2C + (2C + 5) = Total seashells

* **Solve for C:**
    * Combine like terms: 5C + 5 = Total seashells
    * Since they divided the total seashells equally, we know the total number of seashells is 27.
    * Substitute the value of the total seashells: 5C + 5 = 27
    * Subtract 5 from both sides: 5C = 22
    * Divide both sides by 5: C = 4.4

* **Find the number of seashells each person got:**
    * Carrey collected C = 4.4 seashells.
    * Carlos collected 2 * C = 2 * 4.4 = 8.8 seashells.
    * Jim collected 2C + 5 = 2 * 4.4 + 5 = 13.6 seashells.

   (1/3)(5(c + 7) + 25) = c + 25

* **Solve for c:**
    * Simplify the equation: (5c + 35 + 25) / 3 = c + 25
    * Further simplification: (5c + 60) / 3 = c + 25
    * Multiply both sides by 3: 5c + 60 = 3c + 75
    * Subtract 3c from both sides: 2c + 60 = 75
    * Subtract 60 from both sides: 2c = 15
    * Divide both sides by 2: c = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define the variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of customers who come into the dealership.
*  Let 'z' represent the number of cars sold.

**2. Set up the equations:**

* We know that for every 25 calls, he gets 1 customer:  x / 25 = y
* We also know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold: y / 2 = z

**3. Solve for 'y' in terms of 'x':**

* From the first equation, we can solve for 'y': y = (25 * x)

**4. Substitute 'y' into the second equation:**

*  (25 * x) / 2 = z

**5.  Solve for 'x' to find the number of calls needed:**

*  We want to find the number of calls (x) that will result in 15 cars sold (z).  
*  We know that z = 15.
*  Substitute z = 15 into the equation: (25 * x) / 2 = 15
*  Multiply both sides by 2: 25 * x = 30
*  Divide both sides by 25: x = 1.2

**6.  Round to the nearest whole number:**

*  Jason needs to make approximately 1.2 * 25 = 30 telephone calls to reach his goal.

**Final answer:** Jason needs to make approximately **30** telephone calls.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered.**
* **Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes, so he gathered x + 2 Petri dishes.**
* **The total number of items Igor gathered is x (test tubes) + (x + 2) (Petri dishes) + y (beakers).**
* **We know the total number of items is 29, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 2) + y = 29**
* **We also know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so x = 16/2 = 8**
* **Substitute the value of x into the equation: 8 + (8 + 2) + y = 29**
* **Simplify the equation: 18 + y = 29**
* **Solve for y: y = 29 - 18 = 11**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Vanessa's speed be represented by 'x' miles per hour.
    * Let Aaron's speed be represented by '2x' miles per hour (twice Vanessa's speed).

* **Use the information given:**
    * Vanessa ran 4 miles.
    * Aaron ran 1 mile (since he ran twice as fast as Vanessa).

* **Set up an equation:**
    * Vanessa's time = Distance / Speed 
    * Vanessa's time = 4 miles / x miles per hour
    * Aaron's time = Distance / Speed
    * Aaron's time = 1 mile / 2x miles per hour

* **Use the given information about Aaron's time:**
    * Aaron's time = 16 minutes 
    * We need to convert this to hours: 16 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.2667 hours

* **Set up an equation to relate Aaron's time to Vanessa's time:**
    * Aaron's time = Vanessa's time 
    * 0.2667 hours = 4 miles / x miles per hour

* **Solve for x (Vanessa's speed):**
    * 0.2667 hours * x miles per hour = 4 miles
    * x = 4 miles / 0.2667 hours
    * x = 15.0 miles per hour

* **Calculate Vanessa's time:**
    * Vanessa's time = Distance / Speed
    * Vanessa's time = 4 miles / 15.0 miles per hour
    * Vanessa's time = 0.2667 hours

* **Convert to minutes:**
    * Vanessa's time = 0.2667 hours * 60 minutes per hour
    * Vanessa's time = 16 minutes

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
