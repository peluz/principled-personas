* **Ratio of boys to girls:**  We know the number of boys is 60, and we need to find the number of girls. 

**To find the number of girls, we can use the following logic:**

* **Total number of people on the Chinese team:** 160
* **Number of girls:** 160 - 60 = 100

**Therefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of white carnations.**
* **Red roses:** Sandra ordered 4x red roses.
* **Pink Calla Lilies:**  She ordered 5x pink calla lilies.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool initially.
    * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool, so it initially had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, so in 4 minutes, they lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the pool sizes:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, meaning it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
    * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We know they have the same amount of water after the leak.
    * 8x = x - 16

* **Solve for x:**
    * 7x = 16
    * x = 16/7

* **Calculate the current water in the small pool:**
    * The small pool has x - 16 gallons, so it has (16/7) - 16 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of camels.**
* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries):

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
   360 - 2d + d = 304
   -d = -56
   d = 56

**Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's break down the costs for each venue:**

* **Venue 1:**
    * Flat fee: $200
    * Food cost: $5 per person * x guests = $5x
    * Total cost: $200 + $5x

* **Venue 2:**
    * Cost per person: $25
    * Number of guests: x
    * Total cost: $25x

**To find the point where the costs are equal, set the two equations equal to each other:**

$200 + $5x = $25x

**Solve for x:**

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

**Answer:** 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.**

* **David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.**

* **Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.**

* **Together they found 43 insects, so x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43**

* **Combine like terms: 3x/2 + 7 = 43**

* **Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x/2 = 36**

* **Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 72**

* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 24**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Lynn's distance be represented by ""L""
    * Paisley's distance is ""P""
    * Reggie's distance is ""R""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P = 4 miles (Paisley's distance)
    * R = 5P + 3 (Reggie's distance is 5 times Paisley's and 3 miles farther)
    * L + P + R = Total distance (Lynn, Paisley, and Reggie's combined distance)

* **Substitute the value of P into the equation for R:**
    * R = 5 * 4 + 3 = 23 miles

* **Now we can find Lynn's distance (L):**
    * L + 4 + 23 = Total distance
    * L + 27 = Total distance
    * L = Total distance - 27

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 's' represent the number of sheep.**
* **Let 'g' represent the number of geese.**

We know:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way:

1. **Solve for 's' in the second equation:** 
   s = 20 - g

2. **Substitute this value of 's' into the first equation:**
   4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'g':**
   80 - 4g + 2g = 70
   -2g = -10
   g = 5

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 't' represent the age of the twin.
    * Let 'p' represent the age of the triplet.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * ""One twin is 7 years older than one triplet"":  t = p + 7
    * ""Their combined ages are 44"": t + p = 44

* **Solve for one of the variables:**
    * Substitute the first equation into the second equation: (p + 7) + p = 44
    * Simplify: 2p + 7 = 44
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 2p = 37
    * Divide both sides by 2: p = 18.5

* **Find the age of the twin:**
    * Substitute the value of p back into the equation t = p + 7: t = 18.5 + 7
    * Simplify: t = 25.5

**Therefore, one of the twins is 25.5 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the total water used by Colorado City.** 
   If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and we want to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we need to know the total amount of water used.

* **Step 2: Calculate the water used for industrial purposes.**
   We know 80% of the water used by Colorado City is for industrial purposes.

* **Step 3: Calculate the water used for non-industrial purposes.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Dora's father's age:** Let's represent Dora's father's age as ""f"".  We know that his age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so: f = 2d + 8 
* **Dora's mother's age:** Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is f - 4.
* **Total combined age:** We need to find the total age of Dora, her father, and her mother. This is: d + f + (f - 4)

**Now, let's plug in Dora's age:**

* We know Dora is 15 years old, so d = 15.
* Substitute this into the equation for her father's age: f = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
* Substitute Dora's father's age into the equation for her mother's age: f - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34

**Finally, calculate the total combined age:**

* Total age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

**Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of zest Tanya uses.**
* **Since she uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, she uses x ounces of fragrance.**
* **She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2x ounces of salt.**
* **She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2x = 4x ounces of oil.**

**Now, we know the total amount of each ingredient is 10 ounces.**  We can set up an equation:

x + x + 2x + 4x = 10

**Combine like terms:**

7x = 10

**Solve for x:**

x = 10 / 7

**Now that we know x (the amount of zest), we can find the amount of oil:**

Oil = 4x = 4 * (10/7) = 40/7 ounces

**Therefore, Tanya uses 40/7 ounces of oil.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **First plane's flights:** Let's say the first plane makes 'x' number of flights per day.
* **Greece flights:** It flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* **France and Germany flights:** The remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each destination gets (1/4x)/2 = 1/8x flights.
* **Second plane's flights:** The second plane flies to Poland, and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44/2 = 22 trips.

**Therefore, the first plane makes 3/4 * x flights to Greece, and the remaining 1/4 * x flights are split equally between France and Germany. The second plane makes 22 trips to Poland.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.  We know the total age is 20 and there are 4 children.
2. **Find Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so her age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.
3. **Set up an equation:** We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's represent Wilfred's age as 'x'.  We can now write an equation: 
   (3 + 4 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20
4. **Solve for Helene's age:**  We can simplify the equation to: (7 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20
5. **Solve for x:**  We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.  We can substitute this into the equation above. 
6. **Solve for x:**  We can now solve for x.

* **Total balls:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

**Now we can solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: 4x / 2 + 4 + x = 19
2. Simplify: 2x + 4 + x = 19
3. Combine like terms: 3x + 4 = 19
4. Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 15

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be ""w""**
* **Let Colin's current age be ""c""**

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25) / 3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

**Let's solve for ""w"" in the first equation:**

w = 5(c + 7)
w = 5c + 35

**Substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:**

c + 25 = (5c + 35 + 25) / 3

**Simplify and solve for ""c"":**

c + 25 = (5c + 60) / 3
3c + 75 = 5c + 60
15 = 2c
c = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Three times the number of cupcakes is 3x.**
* **Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, so she made 3x - 2 brownies.**
* **Carly made a total of 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.**
* **The number of brownies is represented by 3x - 2.**
* **We know the number of brownies is equal to the number of cupcakes, so 3x - 2 = x.**
* **Solving for x, we get 2x = 2, so x = 1.**

**Therefore, Carly made 1 cupcake.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
   * Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  S = K + 8  (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)

* **Discount:** 80% of $400 = $320
* **Price after discount:** $400 - $320 = $80
* **Labor cost:** $50/hour * 3 hours = $150
* **Total cost:** $80 + $150 = $230

**Answer:** $230

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Each chicken has 2 legs, each cow has 4 legs)

Now we can solve for 'c'.  Here's one way:

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.** 


**Answer: 5**
