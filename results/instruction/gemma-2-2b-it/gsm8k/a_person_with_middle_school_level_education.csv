* **Hamsters:**  We know 10 cages of hamsters got 5 pieces of straw each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw for the hamsters.
* **Total Straw:**  We know 160 pieces of straw were given to the small rodents, and we know 50 pieces were given to the hamsters. That means 160 - 50 = 110 pieces of straw were given to the rats.
* **Rats per Cage:**  We know there are 3 cages of rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. So, we can find the number of rats by dividing the total straw given to the rats by the number of pieces per rat: 110 / 6 = 18.33.

* **Let's figure out their ages:**  Since their ages add up to 20, we need to find two numbers that together equal 20. 
* **Think about numbers:**  We can think of numbers that add up to 20.  For example, 10 and 10, 9 and 11, 8 and 12, and so on.
* **Find the solution:**  We need to find two numbers that add up to 20.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let Ruby's current age be ""R""
   * Let Sam's current age be ""S""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * ""Ruby is 6 times older than Sam"": R = 6S
   * ""In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam"": R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

* **Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

   1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** Since we know R = 6S, we can replace R in the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

   2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
      * 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
      * 3S = 18
      * S = 6

* **Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the speed of the car in the slow lane:**

* The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, so it's going 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

**2. Use the formula: distance = speed x time**

* We know the distance (480 miles) and the speed of the car in the slow lane (30 miles/hour).  Let's call the time it took the slow lane car ""t"".
*  480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

**3. Solve for time (t):**

* Divide both sides of the equation by 30 miles/hour: 
   t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

* We know Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute that into the equation: 2s - 5 = 45.
* Now we can solve for ""s"" (Carver's son's age):
    * Add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2s = 50
    * Divide both sides by 2: s = 25

    * We know 4x - 5 represent the number kicked out for shoplifting.
    * We also know 3(4x - 5) represent the number kicked out for physical violence.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The total number of people kicked out is x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: 9x - 20 = 50
    * Add 20 to both sides: 9x = 70
    * Divide both sides by 9: x = 70/9

* **Find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:**
    * Since we know x represents the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for mask refusal from the total number of people kicked out: 50 - x

* **Calculate the final answer:**

* **Let's use an unknown:**  Let's say the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had was represented by the variable ""x"".

**Setting up the equation:**

*  He sold 3/5 of his land, which means he has 2/5 of his land left.
*  We know 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

**Solving for x:**

*  To find the original amount of land (x), we can set up a proportion: 
   (3/5) * x = 12.8 hectares

*  To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
   3 * x = 12.8 * 5

*  Simplify:
   3x = 64 hectares

*  Divide both sides by 3:
   x = 21.33 hectares (approximately)

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of camels.**
* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries):

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
   360 - 2d + d = 304
   -d = -56
   d = 56

**Answer:** There are **56** dromedaries.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
   * David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
   * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Total insects:**  The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + x/2 + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve for x:**
   * Combine like terms: (3x/2) + 7 = 43
   * Subtract 7 from both sides: (3x/2) = 36
   * Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 72
   * Divide both sides by 3: x = 24

* **Find Lily's insects:**
   * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (24/2) + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

   16 students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank a total of 16 * 2 = 32 quarts of tea.

* **Step 3: Add the tea drunk by both groups.**
   The total tea drunk is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

* **Step 4:  Find the total tea at the beginning.**
   We started with 10 quarts left, and we drank 38 quarts, so we had 10 + 38 = 48 quarts at the beginning.

* **Step 5: Convert quarts to gallons.**
   There are 4 quarts in a gallon. So, we have 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons of tea at the beginning.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'S' represent the number of cards Smendrick has.
    * Let 'P' represent the number of cards PJ has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has S + 12 cards.
    * Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so S = 3P.
    * The total number of cards is 341: S + P + Becca = 341

* **Now we can solve for Becca's cards:**
    * Substitute the value of S from the second equation into the third equation:  (3P) + P + (S + 12) = 341
    * Simplify: 4P + S + 12 = 341
    * Since S = 3P, substitute that in: 4P + 3P + 12 = 341
    * Combine like terms: 7P + 12 = 341
    * Subtract 12 from both sides: 7P = 329
    * Divide both sides by 7: P = 47

* **Find Becca's cards:**
    * S = 3P, so S = 3 * 47 = 141
    * Becca has S + 12 cards, so Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Let's break this down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let your age be represented by ""x""
    * Your brother's age is ""x + 3"" (3 years younger than you)
    * Your sister's age is ""x - 2"" (2 years younger than you)
    * Your mom's age is ""3(x + 3) - 1"" (one less than three times your brother's age)

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The sum of our ages is 87:  x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: 5x + 4 = 87
    * Subtract 4 from both sides: 5x = 83
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 16.6

* **Find your age:**
    * Since x represents your age, you are 16.6 years old. 

**Final answer:** 16.6

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be represented by ""P""
    * Let Paul's age be represented by ""P"" + 10 (since he's 10 years older than John)
    * Let John's age be represented by ""J""

* **Set up an equation:**
    * We know the combined age is 100: P + P + J = 100

* **Use the information about Peter's age:**
    * We know Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age: P = P + 10 + J

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: (P + 10 + J) + P + J = 100
    * Combine like terms: 2P + 2J + 10 = 100
    * Simplify: 2P + 2J = 90

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    * Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    * Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Now we can solve for Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Simplify: 2S + W + 5 = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into the simplified equation: 2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339
    * Simplify: 2S + 4W - 8 = 339
    * We still have two unknowns (S and W), but we can use the first equation to solve for S:
        * S = A - 5 
        * Substitute this into the simplified equation: 2(A - 5) + 4W - 8 = 339
        * Simplify: 2A - 10 + 4W - 8 = 339
        * Combine like terms: 2A + 4W - 18 = 339
        * We still have two unknowns (A and W), but we can use the first equation to solve for A:
            * A = S + 5
            * Substitute this into the equation: 2(S + 5) + 4W - 18 = 339
            * Simplify: 2S + 10 + 4W - 18 = 339
            * Combine like terms: 2S + 4W - 8 = 339
            * We now have two equations with two unknowns:
                * 2A + 4W - 18 = 339
                * 2S + 4W - 8 = 339
            * Solve for A and W using substitution or elimination. 

* **Solve for W:**
    * Once you have a value for A and S, you can substitute them back into the equation S = 4W - 13 to find the number of Pokemon Stan caught.

**Note:** This problem involves a bit of algebra.  It's important to be careful with your calculations and make sure you substitute the correct values.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **First plane's flights:** The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights.
* **Flights to France and Germany:** The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of those countries gets 1/2 of the remaining flights.
* **Poland flights:** The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and it makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.

**Let's break it down:**

1. **Let's say the first plane makes 'x' number of flights in a day.**
2. **Greece flights:** (3/4) * x 
3. **France and Germany flights:** (1/2) * (x - (3/4) * x)
4. **Poland flights:** 44

**We know the other plane makes half the number of flights as the first plane, so:**

* **Poland flights:** 44 = (1/2) * x

**Now we can solve for x:**

* **Poland flights:** 44 = (1/2) * x
* **x = 44 * 2 = 88**

**Therefore, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.**

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the charge loss after 5 hours.**
   * The power bank loses 9% of its charge per hour.
   * Over 5 hours, it loses 9% * 5 = 45% of its charge.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after 5 hours.**
   * The power bank started with 100% charge.
   * After 5 hours, it had 100% - 45% = 55% charge.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge loss after 8 hours.**
   * The power bank loses 7% of its charge per hour.
   * Over 3 hours, it loses 7% * 3 = 21% of its charge.

* **Step 4: Calculate the charge remaining after 8 hours.**

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the amount the first person received.
   * The second person received 'x + $80'.
   * The third person received '2 * (x + $80)'.

* **Set up an equation:** The total amount divided by three people equals the amount each person received. So:

"Let's break this down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

* **Set 1:** Rory retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls in the first set.

* **Set 3:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls in the third set.

* **Total balls:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = 3.75

* **Find the number of balls in the first set:** Since x represents the number of balls in the second set, Rory retrieved 3.75 balls in the second set. 

* **Find the number of balls in the first set:**  Rory retrieved x + 4 balls in the first set, so he retrieved 3.75 + 4 = 7.75 balls in the first set.

**Final answer:**  Rory retrieved 7.75 tennis balls in the first set.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Colin's current age be represented by the variable ""C""
    * Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable ""W""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"":  W = 5(C + 7) 
    * ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": W + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

* **Solve the equations:**
    * We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get rid of W: 
       5(C + 7) + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)
    * Simplify and solve for C:
       5C + 35 + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)
       5C + 60 = (1/3)(W + 25)
       5C + 60 = (1/3)W + 25/3
       5C + 60 - (1/3)W = 25/3
       (15C + 180 - W) / 3 = 25/3
       15C + 180 - W = 25
       15C - W = -155 
    * We can now solve for C using the first equation:
       W = 5(C + 7)
       Substitute this into the equation above:
       15C - (5(C + 7)) = -155
       15C - 5C - 35 = -155
       10C = -120
       C = -12

* **The answer:** 
Colin is currently -12 years old.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know that b = 3c - 2 (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)
    * We also know that each person gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

* **Solve for the number of cupcakes:**
    * We know that b + c = 10 (total treats)
    * We can substitute the first equation (b = 3c - 2) into the second equation: (3c - 2) + c = 10
    * Simplify: 4c - 2 = 10
    * Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12
    * Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

* **Answer:** Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
   *  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

* **Solve for 'c' (the number of chickens):**
   *  We can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solve the first equation for 'w':
      * w = 20 - c
   * Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
      * 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
   * Simplify and solve for 'c':
      * 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
