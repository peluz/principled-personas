The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

**Setting up the Equation:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water used.

The ratio can be expressed as: 7/13 = 120 teaspoons / x cups

We know:

* s = 2b (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* s + (s + 2) + b + (b + 2) = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

Now, let's simplify and solve for 's':

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**  There are three numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) on a six-sided die.  The probability of rolling one of these is 3/6 = 1/2.
* **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:** There are three even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  To get the probability of two even numbers in a row, we multiply these probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.
* **Difference in probabilities:** The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4. The difference is (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4.

"Let's break down this problem using variables to represent Ruby's and Sam's current ages.

* Let Ruby's current age be represented by ""R""
* Let Sam's current age be represented by ""S""

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** R = 6S  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **Equation 2:** R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for S (Sam's current age). 

**Solve for R in Equation 1:**
R = 6S

**Substitute R in Equation 2:**
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Simplify and solve for S:**
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Lynn's distance be represented by ""L""
    * Paisley's distance is ""P""
    * Reggie's distance is ""R""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P = 4 miles (Paisley's distance)
    * R = 5 * P + 3 miles (Reggie's distance)
    * L = ? (Lynn's distance)

* **Substitute the value of P into the equation for R:**
    * R = 5 * 4 + 3 miles
    * R = 20 + 3 miles
    * R = 23 miles

* **Now we can find Lynn's distance (L):**
    * R = L + P + 4 miles
    * 23 miles = L + 4 miles
    * L = 23 miles - 4 miles
    * L = 19 miles

**Therefore, Lynn ran 19 miles.**

We know:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way:

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the total water used by the city.** 
   If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and we want to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we need to know the total amount of water used.

* **Step 2: Calculate the water used for industrial purposes.**
   80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes.

* **Dora's father's age:** Let's represent Dora's father's age as ""f"".  We know that his age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so: f = 2d + 8 
* **Dora's mother's age:** Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is f - 4.
* **Total combined age:**  We need to find the total age of Dora, her father, and her mother. This is: 15 + (f) + (f - 4)

**Now, let's substitute the value of 'f' from the first equation into the total age equation:**

15 + (2d + 8) + (2d + 8 - 4)

**Simplify the equation:**

15 + 2d + 8 + 2d + 4 = 3d + 27

**We know Dora is 15 years old, so we can substitute that in for 'd':**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's break down the shingles needed for each house:**
    * The first house needs 1/2 the amount of the second house.
    * The third house needs double the amount of the first house.

* **Let's represent the amount of shingles needed for the second house with the variable 'x'.**

* **The first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so it needs x/2 shingles.**

* **The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x shingles.**

* **The total number of shingles needed is 250, so we can set up an equation:**
    * x/2 + x + x = 250

* **Simplify the equation:**
    * 3x/2 = 250

* **Solve for x:**
    * 3x = 500
    * x = 500 / 3 
    * x = 166.67 (approximately)

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest (in ounces).
    *  Since she uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, we can say the amount of fragrance is also 'x' ounces.
    *  Salt is equal to sugar, so let's say 'y' represents the amount of salt (in ounces).
    *  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so it's 2y ounces.

* **Set up an equation:**
    *  We know the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces.  
    *  This translates to: x + x + y + y = 10 

* **Simplify the equation:**
    *  2x + 2y = 10

* **Use the given information to express 'y' in terms of 'x':**
    *  We know salt is equal to sugar, so y = x.

* **Substitute 'y' into the equation:**
    *  2x + 2x = 10
    *  4x = 10

* **Solve for 'x':**
    *  x = 10/4 = 2.5 ounces

* **Calculate the amount of oil:**
    *  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so oil = 2 * 2.5 = 5 ounces.

**Answer:** Tanya uses 5 ounces of oil.

* **Probability of no extension with normal teacher:** 60% (100% - 40%)
* **Probability of Marcus getting an extension:** 20%
* **Probability of Marcus getting an extension regardless of teacher:** 20%

To find the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probability of each scenario and their combined probability.

* **Scenario 1:** Substitute teacher, no extension: 0.5 * 0.60 = 0.30

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.**

* **First set:** Rory retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls.

* **Total balls:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30

* **Since we can't have a fraction of a ball, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.**  It seems there might be an error in the problem statement.  

**Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of balls Rory retrieved in the first set.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**
* **The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's x - 7 centimeters long.**
* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.**

**The combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:**
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Now, solve for x:**
x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12 

**The yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.**

**Now, find the length of the red rope:**
Red rope length = 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

**Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be ""w""**
* **Let Colin's current age be ""c""**

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25) / 3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know w = 5(c + 7), we can substitute this into the second equation:
   c + 25 = (5(c + 7) + 25) / 3

2. **Simplify and solve for c:**
   * c + 25 = (5c + 35 + 25) / 3
   * c + 25 = (5c + 60) / 3
   * 3(c + 25) = 5c + 60
   * 3c + 75 = 5c + 60

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:** 
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.**
