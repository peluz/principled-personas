* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, so in 4 minutes, they lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the pool sizes:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, meaning it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let Ruby's current age be 'R'**
* **Let Sam's current age be 'S'**

We know:

* **R = 6S** (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **R + 9 = 3(S + 9)** (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for S (Sam's current age):

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** 
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Let's break down the information:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is 105:  x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now, let's solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: 3x + x/2 = 105
2. Find a common denominator: (6x/2) + x/2 = 105
3. Combine terms: (7x/2) = 105
4. Multiply both sides by 2: 7x = 210
5. Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

**Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'.**

* **The number of students in the smallest group is then 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the three groups is 2x + (x - 10) = 3x - 10**

* **We know the total number of students is 200, so we can set up an equation:** 2x + (x - 10) = 200

* **Simplify the equation:** 3x - 10 = 200

* **Solve for x:** 3x = 210

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of cows.**
* **Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, he has 2c chickens.**

* **The total number of animals is 60, so c + 2c = 60**
* **Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60**
* **Dividing both sides by 3, we find c = 20**

* **Since he has 2c chickens, he has 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.**

* **Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs.  The total number of legs is 20 * 4 + 40 * 2 = 80 + 80 = 160**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.**
* **Four times the number of mask refusals is 4x.**
* **Five less than four times the number of mask refusals is 4x - 5.**
* **This number represents the people kicked out for shoplifting.**
* **Three times the number of shoplifters is 3(4x - 5).**
* **The total number of people kicked out is x + 4x - 5 + 3(4x - 5) = 50**

Now, let's solve for x:

* **Combine like terms: 9x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50**
* **Combine like terms: 21x - 20 = 50**
* **Add 20 to both sides: 21x = 70**
* **Divide both sides by 21: x = 3.33**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of camels.**
* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries).

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(180 - d) + d = 304

   -d = -56
   d = 56

**Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.**

**Let's break down the costs for each venue:**

* **Venue 1:**
    * Flat fee: $200
    * Food cost: $5 per person * x guests = $5x
    * Total cost: $200 + $5x

* **Venue 2:**
    * Cost per person: $25
    * Number of guests: x
    * Total cost: $25x

**To find the point where the costs are equal, set the two equations equal to each other:**

$200 + $5x = $25x

**Solve for x:**

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

**Answer:** 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.**

* **David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.**

* **Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.**

* **Together they found 43 insects, so x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43**

* **Combine like terms: 3x/2 + 7 = 43**

* **Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x/2 = 36**

* **Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 72**

* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 24**

* **David found x/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.**

* **Lily found (x/2) + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.**


**Therefore, Lily found 19 insects.**

* **Let 's' represent the number of sheep.**
* **Let 'g' represent the number of geese.**

We know:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way:

1. **Solve for 's' in the second equation:** 
   s = 20 - g

2. **Substitute this value of 's' into the first equation:**
   4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'g':**
   80 - 4g + 2g = 70
   -2g = -10
   g = 5

4. **Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g:**

"Let's break down the information:

* **Let 't' represent the age of the triplet.**
* **Let 'w' represent the age of the twin.**

We know:

* **w = t + 7** (The twin is 7 years older than the triplet)
* **w + t + t + t = 44** (The combined ages of the twins and triplets)

Simplify the second equation:

* **w + 3t = 44**

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* **(t + 7) + 3t = 44**

Combine like terms:

* **4t + 7 = 44**

Subtract 7 from both sides:

* **4t = 37**

Divide both sides by 4:

* **t = 9.25**

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's assume the triplets are 9 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Dora's father's age:** Let's represent Dora's father's age as ""F"".  We know that his age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so: F = 2D + 8
* **Dora's mother's age:** Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is F - 4.
* **Total combined age:** We need to find the total age of Dora, her father, and her mother. This is: D + F + (F - 4)

Now, we know Dora is 15 years old.  Let's substitute that into our equations:

* F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
* F - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34

Finally, we can calculate the total combined age:

* D + F + (F - 4) = 15 + 38 + (38 - 4) = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
    * Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    * Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**
    * 7x + 12 = 341
    * 7x = 329

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos' speed:**  Let's assume a kangaroo travels at a speed of 'k' miles per hour.
* **Turtles' speed:** Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is 'k/2' miles per hour.

**Calculating the Time**

* **Total distance:** The distance the kangaroos cover is the same for the turtles.
* **Time = Distance / Speed**

**Solving for Time**

1. **Kangaroos' time:** 18 hours = (Distance) / k 
2. **Turtles' time:**  We need to find the time for four turtles to cover the same distance. Let's call the time for the turtles 't'.  We can set up the equation: (Distance) / (k/2) = t

**Simplifying the Equation**

* **Distance:** Since the distance is the same for both, we can substitute the distance from the kangaroos' equation into the turtles' equation.
* **Time:**  We can now solve for 't'.

**Final Calculation**

* **t = (18 hours * k) / (k/2) = 36 hours**


**Answer:** It will take the four turtles **36 hours** to travel across the highway.

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.  We know the total age is 20 and there are 4 children, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years.

2. **Calculate Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so she is 2 * 5 = 10 years old.

3. **Calculate the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro:**  Their combined age is 3 + 4 = 7 years.

4. **Calculate Wilfred's age:** The total age of all the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene, so Wilfred's age is 20 - 7 - 10 = 3 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter:**

* Peter has 64 chocolate bars total.
* Peter has the same number of bars in each box.
* Peter's boxes have 64 / number of boxes = 64 / x 

**2. Find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha:**

* Martha has 56 chocolate bars total.
* Martha has the same number of bars in each box.
* Martha's boxes have 56 / number of boxes = 56 / y

**3. Set up an equation to find the difference:**

* The difference in the number of bars per box is the key to the problem.
*  Peter's bars per box - Martha's bars per box = difference

**4. Solve for the difference:**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal sells for 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.**
* **We know Teresa earned $120 in total, so $8x + $12 * x = $120**
* **Combining like terms: 20x = $120**
* **Solving for x: x = $120 / 20 = 6**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Identify the relationship:** The prices are proportional, meaning the number of sandwiches and the price are directly related.
* **Find the price per sandwich:** 
    * The first package has 2 sandwiches at $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
* **Calculate the price of the 8-sandwich package:**
    * The second package has 4 sandwiches at $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.
    * Since the prices are proportional, the 8-sandwich package will cost $1.50 per sandwich multiplied by 8 sandwiches, resulting in $12.00.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid:**

* 75% of $2000 = (75/100) * $2000 = $1500

**2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the amount of money Ronnie had:**  Let Ronnie's initial amount be represented by 'x'.
* **Rissa's initial amount:** Rissa had thrice the amount Ronnie had, so she had 3x.
* **Money given to their sister:**  Both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount to their sister. Let's call this amount 'y'.
* **Rissa's remaining amount:** After giving money, Rissa has 4/5 of her initial amount, which is (3x) - y.
* **Setting up the equation:** We know that Rissa has 4/5 of her money left, so we can write the equation: (3x - y) = (4/5) * 3x

**Solving for y:**
1. Simplify the equation: 3x - y = (12/5)x
2. Subtract 3x from both sides: -y = (12/5)x - 3x
3. Combine like terms: -y = (3/5)x
4. Solve for y: y = (-5/3)x

**Finding Ronnie's remaining amount:**
* **Ronnie's initial amount:** x
* **Money given to their sister:** y = (-5/3)x
* **Ronnie's remaining amount:** x - y = x - (-5/3)x = (8/3)x

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  W = 5(C + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** C + 25 = (W + 25)/3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Three times the number of cupcakes is 3x.**
* **Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, so she made 3x - 2 brownies.**
* **Carly made a total of 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.**
* **We know the total number of brownies and cupcakes is 10 treats.**

**Let's use the information about brownies to solve for x:**

* **Carly made 3x - 2 brownies.**
* **We know the number of brownies is equal to the number of cupcakes.**
* **Therefore, 3x - 2 = x**

**Solve for x:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
   * Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  S = K + 8  (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
   *  S = 27 - 12 (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)

* **Solve for Kim's paintings (K):**
   * Since S = K + 8 and S = 27 - 12, we can substitute the first equation into the second:
     * K + 8 = 27 - 12
     * K + 8 = 15
     * K = 15 - 8

* **Find James's current age:** Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. James is twice as old as Dora, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **Find John's age:** John was 32 when his youngest son was born.
* **Find the youngest son's age in 3 years:** The youngest son is John's child, so he is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:** 
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**


**Answer: 5**
