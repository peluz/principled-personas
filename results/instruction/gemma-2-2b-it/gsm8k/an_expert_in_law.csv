**Understanding the Ratio:**

The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

**Setting up the Equation:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water used.

The ratio can be expressed as: 7/13 = 120 teaspoons / x cups

**Solving for x:**

1. Cross-multiply: 7 * x = 13 * 120
2. Simplify: 7x = 1560
3. Divide both sides by 7: x = 222.86 cups (approximately)

**Finding the Number of Teaspoonfuls of Sugar:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* The ratio is 7:13, meaning for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.
* We need to find the number of teaspoons of sugar for 1 cup of water. 
* We can use the ratio to find this: 7/13 = 120 teaspoons / x cups
* Solve for x: x = 120 teaspoons / (7/13) = 222.86 cups
* We know that 1 cup of water is equal to 222.86 teaspoons of sugar.


**Final Answer:**

Katy used **222.86** teaspoonfuls of sugar.

We know:

* **S = 2B** (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate total revenue:**

* They sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass sells for $0.50, so they make 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon in revenue.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* We know that c + w = 60 (total number of animals)
* We also know that c = 2w (twice as many chickens as cows)

**Solve for the number of cows (w):**

1. Substitute the value of 'c' from the second equation into the first equation: 2w + w = 60
2. Combine like terms: 3w = 60
3. Divide both sides by 3: w = 20 

**Solve for the number of chickens (c):**

* c = 2 * w = 2 * 20 = 40

**Calculate the total number of legs:**

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* Total legs: 80 + 80 = 160

* **Blue beetle weight:** The frog weighs the same as the blue beetle. So, the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds.
* **Green toad weight:** The frog weighs the same as the green toad. So, the green toad weighs 50 pounds.
* **Yellow snake weight:** The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds less than the frog, so it weighs 50 - 10 = 40 pounds.
* **Red bird weight:** The red bird weighs 20 pounds more than the blue beetle, so it weighs 50 + 20 = 70 pounds.
* **Total weight:** The container weighs 20 pounds, and the animals weigh 50 + 50 + 50 + 40 + 70 = 260 pounds.

**Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds.**

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of camels.**
* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way to do it:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**

* **Sticks Equation:** 2x + 8y ≥ 400 (The total number of sticks must be at least 400)
* **Non-negativity:** x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (Frederick can't buy negative pieces of wood)

**3. Solve the Problem:**

To find the most popsicle sticks he can make, we need to find the combination of 'x' and 'y' that satisfies the cost and sticks equations while staying within the non-negativity constraints.  This is a linear programming problem.  

**4.  Graphical Solution:**

* Graph the equations on a coordinate plane. The feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied.
* Find the corner points of the feasible region.
* Evaluate the number of sticks at each corner point.

**5.  Optimal Solution:**

The corner point that gives the maximum number of popsicle sticks is the optimal solution.

**Understanding the Concept**

This is a classic example of a relative speed problem.  We need to find the time it takes for Tom to close the distance between them.

**Calculations**

* **Relative Speed:** Tom is closing the gap with Bob, so we need to find the difference in their speeds.  The relative speed is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.
* **Time to Close the Gap:**  We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables to represent the unknown quantities:

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* 7x = 329
* x = 47 

Since Smendrick has 3x cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

* Alba's earnings: 5x * 6 = 30x

**Total earnings from lawn mowing:** 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x

**Total earnings from lemonade sales:** 80

**We know that the total earnings from lawn mowing plus lemonade sales must equal Tasha's total earnings:**

54x + 80 = Tasha's total earnings

**We need to find the value of x, the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.**

**We can use the information given to solve for x:**

* Tasha made $80 from lemonade sales.
* We know that the total earnings from lawn mowing plus lemonade sales must equal Tasha's total earnings.
* 54x + 80 = Tasha's total earnings

**We can solve for x:**

* 54x = Tasha's total earnings - 80
* 54x = 80 - 80
* 54x = 0
* x = 0

**This means Tasha mowed Joe's lawn zero times.**

**Therefore, Tasha made $0 from lemonade sales.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables to represent the unknown quantities:

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

* A + S + W = 339  (The total number of Pokemon caught)
* A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Now we can solve for Stan's catch:

1. **Substitute** the first equation (A = S + 5) into the second equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation (S = 4W - 13) into the simplified equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339
   2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
   9W - 21 = 339
   9W = 360
   W = 40

5. **Substitute the value of W back into the third equation to find S:**
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

6. **Finally, substitute the value of S back into the first equation to find A:**
   A + 147 + W = 339
   A + 147 + 40 = 339
   A + 187 = 339
   A = 152

**Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.**

* **Poland flights:** The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and it makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes. 
* **Solving for x:** We know the other plane makes 44 trips, and we know it makes half the number of trips the first plane makes.  Therefore, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.

2. **Find Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.

3. **Set up an equation:** We know the total age is 20, so (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20.

4. **Substitute known values:** We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.  We can substitute these values into the equation to get (3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20.

5. **Solve for Helene's age:**  We can simplify the equation to 7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20.  

6. **Solve for Wilfred's age:**  We can solve for Helene's age by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation.  This gives us Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 13.

7. **Find the age of Wilfred:**  We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.  We can substitute the value of Helene's age from step 6 into this equation.

8. **Calculate the age of Wilfred:**  We can solve for Wilfred's age by substituting the value of Helene's age into the equation.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal sells for 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.**
* **We know the total earnings from all sales are $120, so $8x + $12 * x = $120**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.**

* **First set:** He retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls.

* **Total balls:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = 3.75

* **Since we can't have a fraction of a ball, there must be an error in the problem statement.**  It's impossible to retrieve a fraction of a ball in this scenario. 


**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently stated.**

"Here's how to break down the problem to find the solution:

**1. Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**

* Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

**2. Calculate Lauren's annual living expenses:**

* She plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

**3. Calculate Lauren's annual savings after living expenses:**

* Her annual savings are $20,000, and her annual living expenses are $40,000, so she has $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 left for other expenses.

**4. Calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save:**

* She wants to save for 20 years, and her annual savings are $20,000.  Therefore, she needs to save $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

**5. Calculate the number of years to reach her savings goal:**

* She needs to save $400,000 and her current savings are $60,000.  Therefore, she needs to save $400,000 - $60,000 = $340,000 more.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.

**2. Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**3. Solve for x:**

* x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
* 6x - 35 = 37
* 6x = 72
* x = 12  (The length of the yellow rope)

**4. Calculate the length of the red rope:**

The red rope is 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Determine Rissa's initial amount:**

* Rissa was given thrice the amount Ronnie received, so she had 3 * $5 = $15.

**2.  Calculate the amount each person gave to their sister:**

*  Let 'x' be the amount each person gave to their sister. 
*  Rissa had $15, and after giving some to her sister, she has 4/5 of her money left, meaning she had 15 - (4/5 * 15) = $15 - $12 = $3 left.
*  Therefore, Rissa gave $3 to her sister.

**3. Calculate the amount Ronnie gave:**

* Ronnie gave $5 - $3 = $2 to their sister.

**4. Calculate the total amount each person gave:**

* Rissa gave $3 to her sister, and Ronnie gave $2 to their sister.

**5. Calculate the total amount each person had:**

* Rissa had $15 initially, and gave $3, leaving her with $15 - $3 = $12.
* Ronnie had $5 initially, and gave $2, leaving him with $5 - $2 = $3.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be ""W""**
* **Let Colin's current age be ""C""**

We are given the following information:

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""**  This translates to: W = 5(C + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""** This translates to: C + 25 = (W + 25)/3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   C + 25 = (5(C + 7) + 25)/3

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**

**1. Define the variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of telephone calls Jason makes.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of customers who come into the dealership.
*  Let 'z' represent the number of cars sold.

**2. Set up the equations:**

* We know that for every 25 calls, he gets 1 customer:  x / 25 = y
* We also know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold: y / 2 = z

**3. Solve for the number of calls:**

* We want to find the number of calls (x) needed to sell 15 cars (z).  
* We need to find a way to express 'z' in terms of 'x'.  
* We can use the second equation: y / 2 = z
* Substitute 'y' with 'x / 25' from the first equation: (x / 25) / 2 = z
* Simplify: x / 50 = z
* Now we know that z = x / 50. 
* We want to find the number of calls (x) that will result in 15 cars sold (z). 
* We can use the equation z = x / 50 and substitute it into the equation for z: 15 = x / 50

* **Test tubes:** Igor gathered half the requested number of test tubes, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** Igor gathered 2 more than the requested number of Petri dishes, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total items:** Igor had 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.
* **Beakers:** We know Igor had 29 items in total, and he had 24 items already, so he lost 29 - 24 = 5 beakers.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Vanessa's speed:** Vanessa ran 4 miles, and since she ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran 2 miles.
* **Aaron's speed:** Aaron ran 16 minutes for 2 miles, so his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.
* **Vanessa's speed:** Vanessa's speed is 4 miles / Vanessa's time. 
* **Vanessa's time:**  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.  

Let's plug in the values:

Vanessa's time = 4 miles / (0.125 miles/minute) = 32 minutes.

**Answer:** 32 minutes

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.**
