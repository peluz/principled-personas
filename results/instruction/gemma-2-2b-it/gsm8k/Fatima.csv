"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * He wants to make twice as many this year, so this year he baked 2x cookies.
    * He baked 15 more than he intended, so this year he baked 2x + 15 cookies.
    * He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110.  So, 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, so in 4 minutes, they lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the pool sizes:**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's represent the unknown:** Let 'x' be the floor Bill is on.
* **Translate the problem into an equation:**  The problem states: ""Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6.""
   * This translates to: x = 4x + 6
* **Solve for x:**
   * Subtract 'x' from both sides: 0 = 3x + 6
   * Subtract 6 from both sides: -6 = 3x
   * Divide both sides by 3: x = -2

**Therefore, Bill is on the -2nd floor.**

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let Ruby's current age be 'R'**
* **Let Sam's current age be 'S'**

We know:

* **R = 6S** (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **R + 9 = 3(S + 9)** (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for S (Sam's current age):

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** 
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Let's break down the information:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is 105:  x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now, let's solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: 3x + x/2 = 105
2. Find a common denominator: (6x/2) + x/2 = 105
3. Combine terms: (7x/2) = 105

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
    * We know 4x - 5 represent the number kicked out for shoplifting.
    * Let 'y' represent the number kicked out for physical violence.

* **Set up the equation:**
    * We know x + (4x - 5) + y = 50 

* **Solve for y:**
    * Combine like terms: 5x - 5 + y = 50
    * Isolate y: y = 50 - 5x + 5
    * Simplify: y = 55 - 5x

* **We need to find the value of x:**
    * We know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. 
    * This means 3(4x - 5) = y
    * Substitute the value of y we found: 3(4x - 5) = 55 - 5x

* **Solve for x:**
    * Simplify: 12x - 15 = 55 - 5x
    * Combine like terms: 17x = 70
    * Solve for x: x = 70/17

* **Find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:**

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries):

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
   360 - 2d + d = 304
   -d = -56
   d = 56

**Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.**


**Answer: 56**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of blue jelly beans.**

* **Red jelly beans:** The jar has 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so there are 0.9x red jelly beans.

* **Green jelly beans:** The jar has 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so there are 1.01x green jelly beans.

* **Total jelly beans:**  The total number of jelly beans is x + 0.9x + 1.01x = 2.91x

* **We know the total is 4500:** 2.91x = 4500

* **Solve for x:** x = 4500 / 2.91 
   * x ≈ 1560.7 

* **Since we can't have a fraction of jelly beans, we need to adjust our thinking.**  Let's assume the note is a bit off.  

* **Let's try a different approach:**  We know the ratio of red to blue jelly beans is 1:1.  This means that if we have 100 jelly beans, there are 100 red and 100 blue.  

* **Let's use this to find the number of green jelly beans:**  Since the ratio of green to blue jelly beans is 1.01:1, we can say that there are 1.01 times as many green jelly beans as blue jelly beans.  

* **We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500:**  This means that there are 4500 jelly beans in total.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's break down the shingles needed for each house:**
    * The first house needs 1/2 the amount of the second house.
    * The third house needs double the amount of the first house.

* **Let's represent the amount of shingles needed for the second house with the variable 'x'.**

* **The first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so it needs x/2 cases of shingles.**

* **The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.**

* **The total number of shingles needed is 250, so we can set up an equation:**
    * x/2 + x + x = 250

* **Simplify the equation:**
    * 3x/2 = 250

* **Solve for x:**
    * 3x = 500
    * x = 500 / 3 
    * x = 166.67 (approximately)

* **The second house needs approximately 166.67 cases of shingles.**

* **The third house needs 2 * 166.67 = 333.34 cases of shingles.**


**Therefore, the third house will need approximately 333.34 cases of shingles.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
    * Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    * Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**
    * 7x + 12 = 341
    * 7x = 329
    * x = 47 

* **Find Becca's cards:** Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos:**  We know the speed of a kangaroo is the base for our calculation.
* **Turtles:** The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo.
* **Time:** The time it takes to travel is directly related to the speed and distance.

**Calculations**

1. **Kangaroo Speed:** Let's assume the speed of a kangaroo is 'x' miles per hour.
2. **Turtle Speed:** The speed of a turtle is 'x/2' miles per hour.
3. **Distance:** The distance is the same for both groups.
4. **Time:**  We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

**Solving for Time**

* **Kangaroos:** 18 hours = Distance / x
* **Turtles:**  Let 't' be the time it takes for the turtles.  We have: t = Distance / (x/2)

**Finding the Relationship**

Since the distance is the same for both groups, we can equate the two equations:

18 hours = Distance / x = Distance / (x/2)

**Simplifying**

* 18 hours = Distance * (1/x) = Distance * (1/(x/2))
* 18 hours = Distance * (2/x)

**Final Answer**

The time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance at half the speed of a kangaroo is **18 hours**.

* Stick 2: (2/3) * 12 mm = 8 mm
* Stick 3: (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm

**2. Calculate the length of glue not used:**

* Total length used: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm

**3. Calculate the total length of glue not used:**

* Total length not used: 12 mm (original length) - 16 mm (used) = -4 mm

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Melanie's current age:**  Let Melanie's current age be represented by the variable 'x'.
* **In 10 years:** In 10 years, Melanie will be x + 10 years old.
* **Thrice her present age:**  Thrice her present age means 3 times her current age, which is 3x.

    * Let Paul's age be represented by 'P + 10' (since he's 10 years older than John)
    * Let John's age be represented by 'J'

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The combined age is 100: P + (P + 10) + J = 100

* **Simplify the equation:**
    * 2P + J = 90

* **We need to find Peter's age (P).**  We can use the fact that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
    * P = P + 10 + J

* **Substitute the value of P from the second equation into the first equation:**
    * 2(P + 10 + J) + J = 90

* **Simplify and solve for J:**
    * 2P + 20 + 2J + J = 90
    * 2P + 3J = 70
    * 2P = 70 - 3J
    * P = (70 - 3J) / 2

* **Substitute the value of P back into the equation P = P + 10 + J:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Bill's current age be 'b'
    * Let his father's age be 'f' when Bill saw the comet the first time.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  Bill saw the comet when he was 30 years old: b = 30
    *  Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the comet the first time: b = 3f

* **Solve for Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time:**
    * We know b = 30, and b = 3f.  
    * Substitute 30 for b in the second equation: 30 = 3f
    * Solve for f: f = 30 / 3 = 10

* **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time:**
    * We know b = 30 and f = 10.
    * Bill saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **First plane's flights:** Let's say the first plane makes 'x' number of flights per day.
* **Greece flights:** It flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* **France and Germany flights:** The remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each destination gets (1/4x)/2 = (1/8)x flights.
* **Second plane's flights:** The second plane flies to Poland, and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44/2 = 22 trips.

**Therefore, the first plane makes (3/4)x flights to Greece, and the remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany. The second plane makes 22 trips to Poland.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.  We know the total age is 20 and there are 4 children.
2. **Find Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so her age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.
3. **Set up an equation:** We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's represent Wilfred's age as 'x'.  We can now write an equation:
   (3 + 4 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20
4. **Solve for Helene's age:**  We can simplify the equation to:
   (7 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20
   7 + Helene's age + x = 80
   Helene's age + x = 73
5. **Solve for Wilfred's age:** We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.  We can substitute Helene's age from step 4 into this equation.
   Helene's age + x = 73
   2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4 = 73
   2 * (3 + 4 + Wilfred's age + 73) / 4 = 73
   2 * (79 + Wilfred's age) / 4 = 73
   79 + Wilfred's age = 152
   Wilfred's age = 73

**Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 73.**

"To calculate the cost of your kitchen floor renovation, we need to determine the number of tiles needed and then multiply that by the cost per tile. 

First, we need to find the area of your kitchen floor in square feet. You've already provided that it's 200 square feet.

Next, we need to determine the side length of the tiles. You've stated that each tile side is 1 foot.

* **Rissa's money after giving to her sister:**  Rissa gave away x/3 of her money.
* **Ronnie's money after giving to her sister:** Ronnie gave away 5/1 of her money.
* **Rissa's remaining money:**  Rissa has 4/5 of her original amount, which can be written as (4/5)x.
* **Rissa's original amount:** We know that Rissa had x, and she has (4/5)x left.  Therefore, we can set up the equation: (4/5)x = x - (x/3)
* **Solving for x:** 
    * (4/5)x = x - (x/3)

"Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the initial amount:** Thomas begins with $1000.
2. **Calculate the number of bills remaining:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 1000 - 10 = 990 bills.
3. **Calculate the number of bills used for the bill:** He uses half of the remaining bills, which is 990 / 2 = 495 bills.
4. **Calculate the amount of money after the bill payment:** He has 990 - 495 = 495 bills left.
5. **Calculate the amount of money after tripling:**  He triples his money, meaning he now has 495 * 3 = 1485 dollars.
6. **Calculate the number of 5 dollar bills:**  He converts all his money to 5 dollar bills, so he has 1485 / 5 = 297 5 dollar bills.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be ""w""**
* **Let Colin's current age be ""c""**

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25) / 3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

**Step 1: Solve for ""w"" in the first equation:**

* w = 5(c + 7)
* w = 5c + 35

**Step 2: Substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:**

* c + 25 = ((5c + 35) + 25) / 3

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for ""c"":**

* c + 25 = (5c + 60) / 3
* 3c + 75 = 5c + 60
* 15 = 2c
* c = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Three times the number of cupcakes is 3x.**
* **Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, so she made 3x - 2 brownies.**
* **Carly made a total of 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.**
* **The number of brownies is represented by 3x - 2.**
* **We know the number of brownies is equal to the number of cupcakes, so 3x - 2 = x.**
* **Solving for x, we get 2x = 2, so x = 1.**

**Therefore, Carly made 1 cupcake.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
   * Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  S = K + 8  (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
   *  S = 27 - 12 (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)

* **Solve for Kim's paintings (K):**
   * Since S = K + 8 and S = 27 - 12, we can substitute the first equation into the second:
     * 27 - 12 = K + 8
     * 15 = K + 8
     * K = 15 - 8
     * K = 7

**Therefore, Kim has 7 paintings.**

* **Find James's current age:** Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. James is twice as old as Dora, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **Find John's age:** John was 32 when his youngest son was born.
* **Find the youngest son's age in 3 years:**  The youngest son is John's child, so he is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
