* **Translate the given information into equations:**
    *  A = 4G - 2  (Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight)
    *  G + A = 125 (Their combined weight is 125 pounds)

* **Solve for G (Grace's weight):**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * He wants to make twice as many this year, so this year he baked 2x cookies.
    * He baked 15 more than he intended, so this year he baked 2x + 15 cookies.
    * He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110.  So, 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

* **Solve for x:**
    * 2x + 10 = 110

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Ratio:**

The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

**Setting up the Equation:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water used.

The ratio can be expressed as: 7/13 = 120/x

**Solving for x:**

1. Cross-multiply: 7 * x = 13 * 120
2. Simplify: 7x = 1560
3. Divide both sides by 7: x = 222.86 cups (approximately)

**Finding the Number of Teaspoonfuls of Sugar:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* The ratio is 7:13, meaning for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.
* We can use the ratio to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

**Final Answer:**

We know:

* s = 2b (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)

* **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:** There are three numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) on a six-sided die.  The probability of rolling one of these is 3/6 = 1/2.
* **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:** There are three even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.
* **Difference in probabilities:** The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4. The difference is (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4.
* **Percentage:** To express the difference as a percentage, multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Kyle's fries:** Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, who took 5. So Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
* **Fries after Kyle and Billy:** Griffin started with 24 fries and Kyle took 5, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Billy took 10 fries, leaving Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
* **Ginger's contribution:** Griffin had 27 fries after the others took some, meaning Ginger gave him 27 - 9 = 18 fries.

**Answer:** Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries.

"Let's break down this problem using variables to represent Ruby's and Sam's current ages.

* Let Ruby's current age be represented by ""R""
* Let Sam's current age be represented by ""S""

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** R = 6S  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **Equation 2:** R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for Sam's current age (S).

**Solve for R in Equation 1:**
R = 6S

**Substitute R in Equation 2:**
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Simplify and solve for S:**

* **Rewards earned:** The customer earned $1 off for every $20 spent, so for their $80 last trip, they earned $80 / 20 = 4 rewards.
* **Coupon discount:** The coupon doubled the rewards, so it gave them 4 * 2 = 8 rewards.
* **Total discount:** The customer used 8 rewards.
* **Price after coupon:**  The customer's last trip cost $80, and they used 8 rewards, so the price after the coupon is $80 - (8 * $1) = $72.

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of cows.**
* **Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, he has 2c chickens.**

* **The total number of animals is 60, so c + 2c = 60**
* **Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60**
* **Dividing both sides by 3, we find c = 20**

* **Since he has 2c chickens, he has 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.**

* **Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs.  The total number of legs is 20 * 4 + 40 * 2 = 80 + 80 = 160**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Frog weight:** The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
* **Blue beetle weight:** The frog weighs the same as the blue beetle.
* **Green toad weight:** The frog weighs the same as the green toad.
* **Yellow snake weight:** The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds less than the frog, so it weighs 50 - 10 = 40 pounds.
* **Red bird weight:** The red bird weighs 20 pounds more than the blue beetle, so it weighs 50 + 20 = 70 pounds.
* **Total weight:** The container weighs 20 pounds, and the animals weigh 50 + 50 + 40 + 70 = 170 pounds.

* Substitute the value of Carver's age into the equation: 2s - 5 = 45.
* Solve for ""s"" by adding 5 to both sides: 2s = 50.
* Divide both sides by 2: s = 25.

Therefore, Carver's son is **25 years old**.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Calculate the distance between the third city and the first city:** The train travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it travels 100 - 50 = 50 miles.
* **Calculate the total distance for one trip:** The total distance for one trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.
* **Calculate the number of trips the train makes in a day:** The train makes 3 trips a day.
* **Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:** The train travels 225 miles * 3 trips = 675 miles in a day.
* **Calculate the number of days between services:** The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  The train travels 675 miles per day, so it needs service every 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 27 days.

"Here's how to break down the calculation:

**Step 1: Calculate the time for the initial leg of the trip.**

* Distance: 200 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the time for the detour.**

* Distance: 10 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the time for the return trip.**

* Distance: 240 miles
* Speed: 80 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the total time.**

* Total time = Time for initial leg + Time for detour + Time for return trip

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.**
* **Four times the number of mask refusals is 4x.**
* **Five less than four times the number of mask refusals is 4x - 5.**
* **Three times the number of shoplifters was 3(4x - 5).**
* **The total number of people kicked out is x + 4x - 5 + 3(4x - 5) = 50**

Now, let's solve for x:

* **Combine like terms: 9x - 20 = 50**
* **Add 20 to both sides: 9x = 70**
* **Divide both sides by 9: x = 7.78**

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to consider the context of the problem.  It's likely that the problem is asking for the number of people kicked out for reasons other than mask refusal, shoplifting, or physical violence. 

**Therefore, we can assume that the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - (7.78) = 42.22**

* **We can set up an equation:** 14 = 3s + 8
* **Solve for 's':**
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 6 = 3s
    * Divide both sides by 3: s = 2
* **Now that we know Sara scored 2 points, we can find Erin's points:**
    * Erin's points are 3s, so Erin scored 3 * 2 = 6 points.

**Answer: Erin had 6 points before.**

* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries):

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
   360 - 2d + d = 304
   -d = -56
   d = 56

**Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of 2x4 pieces Frederick buys.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of 2x8 pieces Frederick buys.

**2. Set up the Equations:**

*  Cost constraint: 4x + 6y ≤ 24  (The total cost of the wood cannot exceed $24)
*  Quantity constraint: 2x + 8y ≥ 400 (The total number of sticks must be at least 400)
*  We also need to express the quantity constraint in terms of x and y. 

**3. Solve the Equations:**

*  The quantity constraint can be rewritten as: 2x + 8y ≥ 400
*  Solve for x in terms of y: 
    * 2x = 400 - 8y
    * x = 200 - 4y

**4. Substitute and Simplify:**

*  Substitute this value of x into the cost constraint: 4(200 - 4y) + 6y ≤ 24
*  Simplify and solve for y: 800 - 16y + 6y ≤ 24
*  Combine like terms: -10y ≤ -776
*  Solve for y: y ≥ 77.6

**5. Analyze the Results:**

*  Since we can't buy fractions of sticks, the maximum number of sticks Frederick can make is 77.6. 

**Final Answer:** 77.6

* **Step 2: Calculate the total sales in the first month.**
   * Total sales in the first month = $400 (red hats) + $200 (green hats) = $600

* **Step 3: Calculate the sales in the second month.**
   * Sales in the second month were 3/4 of the first month's sales: $600 * (3/4) = $450

* **Step 4: Calculate the total sales over two months.**
   * Total sales in two months = $600 (first month) + $450 (second month) = $1050

* **Let 's' represent the number of sheep.**
* **Let 'g' represent the number of geese.**

We know:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way:

1. **Solve for 's' in the second equation:** 
   s = 20 - g

2. **Substitute this value of 's' into the first equation:**
   4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'g':**
   80 - 4g + 2g = 70
   -2g = -10
   g = 5

4. **Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g:**
   s = 20 - 5
   s = 15

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the speed of a thingamabob.**
* **A whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob, so its speed is 5x.**
* **A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning its speed is 11x.**
* **We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so 11x = 121 meters per second.**
* **Solve for x: x = 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.**
* **The whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob, so its speed is 5 * 11 meters per second = 55 meters per second.**

**Therefore, a whirligig spins 55 meters per second.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Joe's lawn mowing:** Let's assume Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times.
* **Kamala's lawn mowing:** She mowed Kamala's lawn three times Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.
* **Alba's lawn mowing:** She mowed Alba's lawn five times Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.
* **Total earnings from lawn mowing:**  Tasha's earnings from lawn mowing are 3x + 5x + x = 9x.
* **Total earnings from lemonade:** Her earnings from lemonade sales are $80 - 6 = $74.
* **Solving for x:** We know that Tasha's total earnings from lawn mowing and lemonade sales are $74.  We can set up an equation: 9x = $74.
* **Solving for x:** Divide both sides by 9: x = $74 / 9.
* **Calculating Joe's lawn mowing:**  x = $8.22 (approximately)

**Therefore, Tasha made $74 from lemonade sales.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Bill's current age be 'b'
    * Let Bill's father's age be 'f' when Bill saw the comet the first time.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time: b = 3 * f 
    *  The comet orbits every 75 years, so the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years.

* **Solve for Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time:**
    * We know Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 
    * Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is 3 times his father's age when he saw the comet the first time. 
    * We can use the information about the comet's orbit to find Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **First plane's flights:**  Let's say the first plane makes 'x' flights per day.
* **Greece flights:** It flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* **France and Germany flights:** The remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each destination gets (1/4x)/2 = (1/8)x flights.
* **Second plane's flights:** The second plane flies to Poland, and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44 / 2 = 22 trips.

**Therefore, the first plane makes (3/4)x flights to Greece, and the remaining (1/8)x flights are split between France and Germany. The second plane makes 22 trips to Poland.**

    *  The second person received 'x + $80'.
    *  The third person received '2(x + $80)'.

* **Set up an equation:** The total amount divided by three people equals the share of each person:
    * (x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920 / 3

* **Simplify and solve for x:**
    * (4x + $160) / 3 = $640
    * 4x + $160 = $1920
    * 4x = $1760
    * x = $440

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Calculate total work time:** 
   - The team worked 3/8th of a day per day for 3 weeks, which is (3/8) * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 21/8 days.

* **Calculate total hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so the total hours worked is (21/8) * 24 hours/day = 63 hours.

* **Calculate hours per painter:**
   - Since there are 4 painters, each painter worked 63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set.**

* **First set:** Rory retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls.

* **Total balls:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = 3.75

* **Since we can't have a fraction of a ball, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.**  It seems there might be an error in the problem statement. 


**Final Answer:**  We cannot determine the number of balls Rory retrieved in the first set with the information provided.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**
* **The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's x - 7 centimeters long.**
* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.**

**The combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:**
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Now, let's solve for x:**
x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

**The yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.**

**Now we can find the length of the red rope:**
Red rope length = 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

**Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be 'w'**
* **Let Colin's current age be 'c'**

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25) / 3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

**Step 1: Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**

* w = 5(c + 7)
* w = 5c + 35

**Step 2: Substitute the value of 'w' from the first equation into the second equation:**

* c + 25 = ((5c + 35) + 25) / 3

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for 'c':**

* c + 25 = (5c + 60) / 3
* 3c + 75 = 5c + 60
* 15 = 2c
* c = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
    *  Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  t = p + 2  (Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes)
    *  t = 16/2 = 8 (Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested)
    *  Total items = t + p + b  (where 'b' is the number of beakers)
    *  29 = 8 + p + b - (number of beakers lost)

* **Solve for the number of beakers lost:**
    *  We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes, Petri dishes, and beakers. 
    *  We can use the equation 29 = 8 + p + b - (number of beakers lost) to solve for the number of beakers lost. 

* **We can't determine the exact number of beakers lost without more information.** 


**Final Answer:** We cannot determine the exact number of beakers Igor lost.

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:** 
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.**
