"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * He wants to make twice as many this year, so this year he baked 2x cookies.
    * He baked 15 more than he intended, so this year he baked 2x + 15 cookies.
    * He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110.  So, 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

* **Solve for x:**
    * 2x + 10 = 110

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool initially.
    * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool, so it initially had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, so in 4 minutes, they lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the pool sizes:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, meaning it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
    * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We know they have the same amount of water after the leak.

* **Solve for x:**
    * 8x = x - 16

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of fish in each aquarium.

* **Set up the equations:**
    *  The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4.
    *  The number of snails in the second aquarium is 32.
    *  The difference between the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.

* **Formulate the equation:**
    *  The difference in snails is 2 * (x + x) = 4x

* **Solve for x:**
    *  The difference in snails is 4x, and the difference in snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
    *  Therefore, 4x = 2x
    *  Solving for x, we get x = 0.

* **The answer:**
    *  The number of fish in each aquarium is 0.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's represent the starting floor as ""x"".**
* **The problem states:**  ""Bill rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6.""
* **This translates to the equation:** x + 6 = 4x + 6

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let Ruby's current age be ""R""**
* **Let Sam's current age be ""S""**

We know:

* **R = 6S** (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **R + 9 = 3(S + 9)** (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is 105:  x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now, let's solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: 3x + x/2 = 105
2. Find a common denominator: (6x/2) + x/2 = 105
3. Combine terms: (7x/2) = 105
4. Multiply both sides by 2: 7x = 210
5. Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

* **Joanne's apples from the average trees:**  She gathered more apples from the average trees than the shortest trees, so let's call the number of apples from the average trees ""x"".
* **Joanne's total apples:** Joanne gathered 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x apples.
* **Sister's apples from the tallest trees:** Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 30 * 2 = 60 apples.
* **Sister's apples from the shortest trees:** She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 15 * 3 = 45 apples.
* **Total apples gathered by the sister:** Her total apples are 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105 apples.
* **Combined total apples:** Joanne's apples + sister's apples = 500 apples.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of camels.**
* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of blue jelly beans.**

* **Green jelly beans:** The jar has 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so there are 1.01x green jelly beans.

* **Total jelly beans:**  The total number of jelly beans is x + 0.9x + 1.01x = 2.91x

* **We know the total is 4500:** 2.91x = 4500

* **Solve for x:** x = 4500 / 2.91 
   * x ≈ 1560.7 

* **Since we can't have a fraction of jelly beans, we need to adjust our thinking.**  Let's assume the number of jelly beans is a whole number. 

* **Let's try a slightly different approach:**  We know the ratio of red to blue jelly beans is 1:1.  This means that if we have 100 jelly beans, there are 100 red and 100 blue.  

* **Let's use this to find the number of jelly beans in each color:**
    * Red jelly beans: 100
    * Blue jelly beans: 100
    * Green jelly beans: 100

* **We know the total is 4500:** 100 + 100 + 100 = 300

* **We can now calculate the difference between green and red jelly beans:** 100 - 100 = 0


**Therefore, the jar contains 0 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.**

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let Jerry's current age be represented by the variable ""x"".**

* **We know he was twice as old 5 years ago:** This means his age 5 years ago was x - 5.

* **We also know he is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago:**  So, his current age (x) is equal to 2 * (x - 5).

* **We want to find his age in 3 years:**  This means we need to add 3 to his current age.

**Now let's solve for x:**

1.  x = 2 * (x - 5)
2.  x = 2x - 10
3.  x - 2x = -10
4.  -x = -10
5.  x = 10

**Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old.**

**In 3 years, he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Lynn's distance be represented by ""L""
    * Paisley's distance is ""P""
    * Reggie's distance is ""R""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P = 4 miles (Paisley's distance)
    * R = 5P + 3 (Reggie's distance is 5 times Paisley's and 3 miles farther)
    * L + P + R = Total distance (Lynn, Paisley, and Reggie's combined distance)

* **Substitute the value of P into the equation for R:**
    * R = 5 * 4 + 3 = 23 miles

* **Now we can find Lynn's distance (L):**
    * L + 4 + 23 = Total distance
    * L + 27 = Total distance
    * L = Total distance - 27

* **We need to find the total distance to solve for L.**  We know that the total distance is the sum of the distances of all three runners.  We know Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 23 miles, and we need to find Lynn's distance.  

* **Therefore, we can find Lynn's distance by substituting the values of P and R into the equation for the total distance:**
    * L + 4 + 23 = Total distance
    * L + 27 = Total distance
    * L = Total distance - 27

* **We can find the total distance by substituting the value of R into the equation for the total distance:**
    * Total distance = 4 + 23 + L
    * Total distance = 27 + L

* **We can now solve for L:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 's' represent the number of sheep.**
* **Let 'g' represent the number of geese.**

We know:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way:

1. **Solve for 's' in the second equation:** 
   s = 20 - g

2. **Substitute this value of 's' into the first equation:**
   4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'g':**
   80 - 4g + 2g = 70
   -2g = -10
   g = 5

4. **Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g:**
   s = 20 - 5
   s = 15

**Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Dora's father's age:** Let's represent Dora's age as ""D"".  Her father's age is ""2D + 8"" (twice Dora's age plus 8).
* **Dora's mother's age:** Her mother is 4 years younger than Dora's father, so her age is ""2D + 8 - 4"" or ""2D + 4"".
* **Total combined age:**  The total combined age is D + (2D + 8) + (2D + 4) = 5D + 12

Now, we know Dora is 15 years old, so:

* 5D + 12 = 15 + 15 
* 5D + 12 = 30
* 5D = 18
* D = 3.6

Since age cannot be a fraction, we made a mistake in our initial assumptions.  Let's re-examine the problem. 


**The problem is flawed.  It's impossible for Dora's father's age to be eight more than twice Dora's age, given the information provided.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of zest Tanya uses.**
* **Since she uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, she uses x ounces of fragrance.**
* **She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2x ounces of salt.**
* **She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2x = 4x ounces of oil.**

**Now, we know the total amount of each ingredient is 10 ounces.**  We can set up an equation:

x + x + 2x + 4x = 10

**Combine like terms:**

7x = 10

**Solve for x:**

x = 10 / 7

**Now that we know x (the amount of zest), we can find the amount of oil:**

Oil = 4x = 4 * (10/7) = 40/7 ounces

**Therefore, Tanya uses 40/7 ounces of oil.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos:**  We know the speed of a kangaroo is the base for the problem.
* **Turtles:** The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo.
* **Time:** The time it takes to travel is directly related to the speed and distance.

**Calculations**

1. **Kangaroo Speed:** Let's assume the speed of a kangaroo is 'x' miles per hour.
2. **Turtle Speed:** The speed of a turtle is 'x/2' miles per hour.
3. **Distance:** The distance is the same for both groups.
4. **Time:**  We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

**Solving for Time**

* **Kangaroos:** 18 hours = Distance / x
* **Turtles:**  Let 't' be the time it takes for the turtles.  We have: t = Distance / (x/2)

**Finding the Relationship**

Since the distance is the same for both groups, we can equate the two equations:

18 hours = Distance / x = Distance / (x/2)

**Simplifying**

* 18 hours = Distance / x = Distance * 2 / x

**Solving for Time**

* 18 hours = 2 * Distance / x
* 18 hours * x = 2 * Distance

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the length of glue used:**

* Stick 1: (1/6) * 12 mm = 2 mm
* Stick 2: (2/3) * 12 mm = 8 mm
* Stick 3: (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm

**2. Calculate the length of glue sticks not used:**

* Total length of used glue: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm
* Total length of unused glue: 12 mm - 16 mm = -4 mm

**3.  The answer is -4 mm.** 

**Important Note:**  The answer is negative because the total length of the unused glue sticks is less than the total length of the glue sticks.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.**

* **Stan's Pokemon:** Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch: 4x - 13

* **Alex's Pokemon:** Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: 4x - 13 + 5

* **Total Pokemon:** The total number of Pokemon caught is the sum of their catches: x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

* **Simplify and solve for x:** 9x - 21 = 339
   * 9x = 360
   * x = 40

* **Stan's Pokemon:** Stan caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so his howl lasts 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* **Combined howl time:**  Tobias' howl is 20 seconds, and Chikote's is 40 seconds, so together they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous' howl:** Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time is 60 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

* **Blue rope length:** The blue rope was 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.

* **Red rope length:** The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the amount of money Ronnie had:**  Let Ronnie's initial amount be represented by 'x'.
* **Rissa's initial amount:** Rissa had thrice the amount Ronnie had, so she had 3x.
* **Money given to their sister:**  Both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount to their sister. Let's call this amount 'y'.
* **Rissa's remaining amount:** After giving money, Rissa has 4/5 of her initial amount, which is (3x) - y.
* **Setting up the equation:** We know that Rissa has 4/5 of her money left, so we can write the equation: (3x - y) = (4/5) * 3x

**Solving for y:**
1. Simplify the equation: 3x - y = (12/5)x
2. Subtract 3x from both sides: -y = (12/5)x - 3x
3. Combine like terms: -y = (3/5)x
4. Solve for y: y = (-5/3)x

**Finding Ronnie's remaining amount:**
* **Ronnie's initial amount:** x
* **Money given to their sister:** y = (-5/3)x
* **Ronnie's remaining amount:** x - y = x - (-5/3)x = (8/3)x

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be ""w""**
* **Let Colin's current age be ""c""**

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25) / 3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know w = 5(c + 7), we can substitute this into the second equation:
   c + 25 = (5(c + 7) + 25) / 3

2. **Simplify and solve for c:**

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:** 
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5
