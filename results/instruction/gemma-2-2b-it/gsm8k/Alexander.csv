"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool initially.
    * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool, so it initially had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, so in 4 minutes, they lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the pool sizes:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, meaning it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
    * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We know they have the same amount of water after the leak.

* **Solve for x:**
    * 8x = x - 16
    * 7x = -16
    * x = -16/7 

* **The answer is not possible:**  We cannot have a negative amount of water. This means there's an error in the problem setup.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the number of fish in each aquarium with the variables 'f' and 'g'.**

* **We know:**
    *  f + g = total number of fish in both aquariums
    *  The difference in snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. 

* **Let's use the information about snails to set up an equation:**
    * 4 snails + 32 snails = 2 * (f + g) 
    * 36 snails = 2 * (f + g)

* **We can simplify the equation:**
    * 36 snails = 2 * (f + g)
    * 18 snails = f + g

* **We know that f + g = 18 snails**

* **We can use this information to solve for the number of fish in each aquarium:**
    * f = 18 - g
    * g = 18 - f

* **We can substitute the value of g in the equation f + g = 18 snails:**
    * f + (18 - f) = 18

**Understanding the Problem**

* We know the speed of the car in the slow lane is half the speed of the car in the fast lane.
* We know the distance traveled by the car in the fast lane.
* We need to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance.

**Calculations**

1. **Slow lane speed:** The car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

2. **Time for the fast lane car:** Time = Distance / Speed.  The fast lane car traveled for 480 miles at 60 miles/hour, so it took 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

3. **Time for the slow lane car:**  We know the slow lane car traveled the same distance (480 miles) at 30 miles/hour.  Therefore, it took 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Let's break down the information:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

"Let's break down this problem:

* Let Carver's son's age be represented by the variable ""s"".
* We know Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, so we can write this as an equation: 2s - 5 = Carver's age.
* We know Carver's age is 45 years old.
* Substitute the value of Carver's age into the equation: 2s - 5 = 45.
* Solve for ""s"" by adding 5 to both sides: 2s = 50.
* Divide both sides by 2: s = 25.

Therefore, Carver's son is **25 years old**.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Calculate the distance between the third city and the first city:** The train travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it travels 100 - 50 = 50 miles.
* **Calculate the total distance for one trip:** The total distance for one trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.
* **Calculate the number of trips the train makes in a day:** The train makes 3 trips a day.
* **Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:** The train travels 225 miles per trip * 3 trips = 675 miles in a day.
* **Calculate the number of days between services:** The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  The train travels 675 miles per day, so it needs service in 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days. 

**Therefore, the train needs service every 26.67 days.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Mask Refusal:** 3 customers were kicked out for mask refusal, and this is represented by ""4 times that many minus 5"".
* **Shoplifting:**  The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is ""4 times that many minus 5"".
* **Physical Violence:** Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence.

**Let's use variables to represent the unknown:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of people kicked out for mask refusal.
* Let 'y' represent the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.
* Let 'z' represent the number of people kicked out for physical violence.

**Now we can set up equations based on the given information:**

* x = 4y - 5 
* y = 3z
* x + y + z = 50

**Solve for 'z' (the number of people kicked out for physical violence):**

* We know x = 4y - 5.  Substitute this into the third equation: (4y - 5) + y + z = 50
* Combine like terms: 5y - 5 + z = 50
* Isolate 'z': z = 50 - 5y + 5
* Substitute the value of 'y' from the second equation: z = 50 - 5(3z) + 5
* Simplify: z = 50 - 15z + 5
* Combine like terms: 16z = 55
* Solve for 'z': z = 55/16

**Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for mask refusal (x):**

* x = 4y - 5
* Substitute the value of 'y' from the second equation: x = 4(3z) - 5
* Simplify: x = 12z - 5
* Substitute the value of 'z' we just found: x = 12(55/16) - 5
* Calculate: x = 330/16 - 5

**Finally, find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting (y):**

* y = 3z
* Substitute the value of 'z' we found: y = 3(55/16)

**Calculate the final answer:**

*  The number of people kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of people kicked out for mask refusal, shoplifting, and physical violence. 
*  This is 50 - (330/16 - 5) - (3(55/16))

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's break down the costs for each venue:**

* **Venue 1:**
    * Flat fee: $200
    * Food cost: $5 per person * x guests = $5x
    * Total cost: $200 + $5x

* **Venue 2:**
    * Cost per person: $25
    * Number of guests: x
    * Total cost: $25x

**To find the point where the costs are equal, set the two equations equal to each other:**

$200 + $5x = $25x

**Solve for x:**

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

**Answer:** 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.**

* **David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.**

* **Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.**

* **Together they found 43 insects, so x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43**

* **Combine like terms: 3x/2 + 7 = 43**

* **Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x/2 = 36**

* **Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 72**

* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 24**

* **David found x/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.**

* **Lily found (x/2) + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.**


**Therefore, Lily found 19 insects.**

* **Red jelly beans:** The jar has 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so there are 0.9x red jelly beans.

* **Green jelly beans:** The jar has 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so there are 1.01x green jelly beans.

* **Total jelly beans:**  The total number of jelly beans is x + 0.9x + 1.01x = 2.91x

* **We know the total is 4500:** 2.91x = 4500

* **Solve for x:** x = 4500 / 2.91 = 1560.7 (approximately)

* **Since we can't have a fraction of jelly beans, we need to adjust our thinking.**  Let's assume the number of jelly beans is a whole number. 

* **Let's try a different approach:**  We know the jar has 1% more green jelly beans than blue, and 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue.  This means the ratio of red to blue jelly beans is 0.9 to 1.  

* **Let's use this ratio to find the number of jelly beans:**  If the ratio of red to blue is 0.9, then the ratio of blue to green is 1.  This means the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans.

* **We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500:**  Let's use this information to find the number of green jelly beans.

* **Let's use the ratio to find the number of green jelly beans:**  Since the ratio of blue to green is 1:1.01, we can say that the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans.

* **We know the number of blue jelly beans is 1560:**  Therefore, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 * 1560 = 1585.6 (approximately).

* **We need to find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans.**

* **The difference is:** 1585.6 - 1560 = 25.6 (approximately)



**Final Answer:**  The jar contains approximately 25.6 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.**

* **The larger angle is twice the smallest:**  This means the larger angle is 2x.

* **The third angle is three times the smallest:** This means the third angle is 3x.

* **The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:** So, we have the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180

* **Simplify and solve for x:** 6x = 180
   * x = 180 / 6
   * x = 30 degrees

* **Find the largest angle:** The largest angle is 2x, so it's 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Lynn's distance be represented by ""L""
    * Paisley's distance is ""P""
    * Reggie's distance is ""R""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P = 4 miles (Paisley's distance)
    * R = 5P + 3 (Reggie's distance is 5 times Paisley's and 3 miles farther)
    * L + P + R = Total distance (Lynn, Paisley, and Reggie's combined distance)

* **Substitute the value of P into the equation for R:**
    * R = 5 * 4 + 3 = 23 miles

* **Now we can find Lynn's distance (L):**
    * L + 4 + 23 = Total distance
    * L + 27 = Total distance
    * L = Total distance - 27

We know:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way:

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.**

* **Extending the dress by 50% means adding 0.5x to the original length.**

* **The extended length is then x + 0.5x = 1.5x**

* **The dress is now 140cm long, so 1.5x + 20 = 140**

* **Solving for x:**
    * 1.5x = 140 - 20
    * 1.5x = 120
    * x = 120 / 1.5
    * x = 80

**Therefore, the dress was 80 centimeters long in its original design.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the total water used by Colorado City.** 
   If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and we want to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we need to know the total amount of water used.

* **Step 2: Calculate the water used for industrial purposes.**
   We know 80% of the water used by Colorado City is for industrial purposes.

* **Step 3: Calculate the water used for non-industrial purposes.**
   To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we can subtract the industrial water use from the total water use.

**Let's break it down:**

* **Total water used:** 40%
* **Industrial water use:** 80%
* **Non-industrial water use:** 100% - 80% = 20%

**Therefore, 20% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of zest Tanya uses.** 
* **Since she uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, she uses 'x' ounces of fragrance.**
* **She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2x ounces of salt.**
* **She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2x = 4x ounces of oil.**

**Now, we know the total amount of each ingredient is 10 ounces.  We can set up an equation:**

x + x + 2x + 4x = 10

**Simplify the equation:**

7x = 10

**Solve for x:**

x = 10 / 7

**Now that we know x (the amount of zest), we can find the amount of oil:**

Oil = 4x = 4 * (10/7) = 40/7 ounces

**Therefore, Tanya uses approximately 40/7 ounces of oil.**


**Final answer: 40/7**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
    * Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos' speed:**  Let's say a kangaroo travels at 'x' miles per hour.
* **Turtles' speed:** Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so they travel at 'x/2' miles per hour.

**Calculating the Time**

* **Kangaroos' total distance:**  Since they travel together, the time is directly proportional to the distance.
* **Turtles' total distance:**  The turtles also travel the same distance.
* **Time = Distance / Speed**

**Setting up the Equation**

Let's use the following variables:

*  *t* = time taken by the turtles

We know:

* 3 kangaroos travel for 18 hours at a combined speed of 3x miles per hour.
* 4 turtles travel for *t* hours at a combined speed of 4(x/2) = 2x miles per hour.

**Solving for Time**

We can set up a proportion to find the time it takes the turtles:

(3 kangaroos * 18 hours) / (3x miles per hour) = (4 turtles * t hours) / (2x miles per hour)

**Simplifying and Solving**

* 54 hours = 2t hours
* t = 27 hours

**Answer:** It will take the turtles **27 hours** to travel the same distance.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips the other two people received.**
* **They received 15 more than x, so they received x + 15.**
* **The total number of corn chips received by the three people is 70 + 70 + (x + 15).**
* **We know that the total number of corn chips is equal to the number of people receiving corn chips.**

**Therefore, we can set up an equation:**

70 + 70 + (x + 15) = 2 * (x + 15)

**Solving for x:**

* 155 + x + 15 = 2x + 30
* 170 = x + 30
* x = 140

**Now we can find the total number of corn chips:**

* 70 + 70 + (140 + 15) = 70 + 70 + 155 = 305

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so his howl lasts 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* **Combined howl time:**  Tobias' howl is 20 seconds, and Chikote's is 40 seconds, so together they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous' howl:** Igneous howls for the combined time of the other two wolves, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time is 60 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Minutes:**  120 seconds is equal to 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.  We know the total age is 20 and there are 4 children.
2. **Find Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so her age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.
3. **Set up an equation:** We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's represent Wilfred's age as 'x'.  We can now write an equation:
   (3 + 4 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20
4. **Solve for Helene's age:**  We can simplify the equation to:
   (7 + Helene's age + x) / 4 = 20
   7 + Helene's age + x = 80
   Helene's age + x = 73
5. **Solve for Wilfred's age:** We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.  We can substitute Helene's age from the previous step into this equation.
   Helene's age + x = 73
   2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4 = 73
   2 * (3 + 4 + Wilfred's age + 73) / 4 = 73
   2 * (79 + Wilfred's age) / 4 = 73
   79 + Wilfred's age = 152
   Wilfred's age = 73

**Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 73.**

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.** 
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, meaning it had 9% of its capacity left after 5 hours.
   - Let's say the initial charge was 'x'. After 5 hours, the remaining charge is 0.9x.
* **Step 2: Calculate the charge after 5 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 0.9x remaining after 5 hours.
* **Step 3: Calculate the charge after 8 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, meaning it had 7% of its capacity left after 3 hours.
   - Let's say the initial charge was 'x'. After 8 hours, the remaining charge is 0.9x.
* **Step 4: Calculate the charge after 8 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, meaning it had 7% of its capacity left after 3 hours.

"Here's how to break down the probabilities:

* **Probability of substitute teacher:** 50%
* **Probability of no extension (normal teacher):** 60% (100% - 40%)
* **Probability of no extension and Marcus getting an extension:** 20% (0.20)
* **Probability of no extension and Marcus not getting an extension:** 40% (0.40)

To get the final probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probability of each scenario and add them up:

* **Scenario 1: Substitute teacher** 
    * Probability of no extension: 0.60
    * Probability of Marcus getting an extension: 0.20
    * Probability of this scenario: 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

* **Scenario 2: Normal teacher**

"To calculate the cost, we need to determine the number of tiles needed and then multiply that by the cost per tile. 

First, we need to find the area of one square foot.  Since the area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, we can calculate the number of tiles needed by dividing the total area by the area of one tile. 

* Area of one tile: 1 square foot
* Total area: 200 square feet
* Number of tiles: 200 square feet / 1 square foot/tile = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost:

* Cost per tile: $12
* Number of tiles: 200
* Total cost: $12 * 200 = $2400

**Therefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor.**

* **The total time was 98 minutes, so x + (x + 18) = 98**

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* **2x + 18 = 98**
* **2x = 80**
* **x = 40** 

This means Donovan spent 40 minutes on the meal.

* **Betsy's time was x + 18, so she spent 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.**

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let 'x' represent Binkie's score.**

* **Twice Binkie's score is 2x.**

* **15 better than twice Binkie's score is 2x + 15.**

* **Frankie's score was 2x + 15.**

* **We know Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's, so we can substitute:** 2x + 15 = 15 + (2 * 90)

* **Simplify the equation:** 2x + 15 = 15 + 180

* **Continue simplifying:** 2x + 15 = 195

* **Solve for x:** 2x = 180
* **Divide both sides by 2:** x = 90

* **Now that we know Binkie's score (x = 90), we can find Frankie's score:** Frankie's score = 2 * 90 + 15 = 180 + 15 = 195

**Therefore, Frankie's score was 195.**

**Medium-sized scenes:**

* Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
* She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
* Time = 36 scenes / 6 scenes/day = 6 days

**Small-sized scenes:**

* Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
* She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'C' represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
    * Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2 * C seashells.
* **Jim's seashells:** Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so he collected 2 * C + 5 seashells.
* **Total seashells:**  The total number of seashells is C + 2C + 5 + C = 4C + 5
* **Equal division:** They divided the total seashells equally, so each person got (4C + 5) / 3 seashells.

**To find the number of seashells each person got, we need to find the value of C.**

* **We know Jim collected 27 seashells:** 2 * C + 5 = 27
* **Solve for C:** 2 * C = 22, so C = 11
* **Calculate the number of seashells each person got:** (4 * 11 + 5) / 3 = (44 + 5) / 3 = 49 / 3 = 16.33

**Therefore, each person got approximately 16.33 seashells.**

"Let's break down the information and solve for the length of the red rope:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**
* **The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it is 'x - 7' centimeters long.**
* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it is 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.**

**The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:**
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Now, let's solve for x:**
x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

**The yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.**

**The blue rope is 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters long.**

**The red rope is 4 * (12 - 7) = 28 centimeters long.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the amount of money Ronnie had:**  Let Ronnie's initial amount be represented by 'x'.
* **Rissa's initial amount:** Rissa had thrice the amount Ronnie had, so she had 3x.
* **Money given to their sister:**  Both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount to their sister. Let's call this amount 'y'.
* **Rissa's remaining amount:** After giving money, Rissa has 4/5 of her initial amount, which is (3x) - y.
* **Setting up the equation:** We know that Rissa has 4/5 of her money left, so we can write the equation: (3x - y) = (4/5) * 3x

**Solving for y:**
1. Simplify the equation: 3x - y = (12/5)x
2. Subtract 3x from both sides: -y = (12/5)x - 3x
3. Combine like terms: -y = (3/5)x
4. Solve for y: y = (-5/3)x

**Finding Ronnie's remaining amount:**
* **Ronnie's initial amount:** x
* **Money given to their sister:** y = (-5/3)x
* **Ronnie's remaining amount:** x - y = x - (-5/3)x = (8/3)x

**Final answer:** The amount left in Ronnie's money is **(8/3)x**.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be ""w""**
* **Let Colin's current age be ""c""**

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25) / 3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

**Step 1: Solve for ""w"" in the first equation:**

* w = 5(c + 7)
* w = 5c + 35

**Step 2: Substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:**

* c + 25 = ((5c + 35) + 25) / 3

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for ""c"":**

* c + 25 = (5c + 60) / 3
* 3c + 75 = 5c + 60
* 15 = 2c
* c = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Test tubes:** Igor gathered half the requested number of test tubes, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** Igor gathered 2 more than the requested number of Petri dishes, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total items:** Igor had 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.
* **Beakers:** We know the total number of items on the bench is 29, and he had 24 items, so he lost 29 - 24 = 5 beakers.

**Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers.

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:** 
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
