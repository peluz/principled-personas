"Let's break this problem down:

* Let 'x' represent the number of copies Harald sold.
* Marilyn sold 10 times the number of copies Harald sold, so Marilyn sold 10x copies.
* The total number of copies sold is the sum of Harald's and Marilyn's sales: x + 10x = 88,000
* Combine like terms: 11x = 88,000
* Divide both sides by 11 to isolate x: x = 88,000 / 11 
* Calculate: x = 8,000

**Answer: Harald sold 8,000 copies.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent Gerald's original time:**  Let Gerald's original time be represented by 'x' seconds.
* **Lee's original time:** Lee's original time was 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee's time is 'x + 2' seconds.
* **Gerald's improved time:**  Gerald's improved time is now 'x + 0.1x' (10% improvement on his original time).
* **We know Lee's time:** Lee ran the race in 38 seconds.
* **Setting up the equation:** We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the times: 
   x + 2 = 38 
* **Solving for x:**  Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
   x = 36
* **Gerald's new time:** Gerald's new time is 'x + 0.1x' which is 36 + 0.1 * 36 = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

**Answer:** Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds. 
"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Cats:** Since there are two cats for every dog, there are 2 * 60 = 120 cats.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know w = 2b (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
   * We also know b = 2q (There are twice as many babies as queens)

* **Solve for the number of worker bees (w):**
   * Since b = 2q, we can substitute this into the first equation: w = 2 * (2q) 
   * Simplify: w = 4q

* **We need to find the value of 'q' to get the number of worker bees (w).**  We know there are 700 bees in total.  

* **Use the information about the total number of bees:**
   *  q + b + w = 700
   *  q + (2q) + (4q) = 700
   *  7q = 700

* **Calculate the time of the second team's runners:**
    * The second team's runners are 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner runs in 60 + 3 = 63 seconds.
    * The third runner runs in 63 + 3 = 66 seconds.
    * The fourth runner runs in 66 + 3 = 69 seconds.

* **Calculate the total time of the second team:**
    * 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds

* **Calculate the time of the first team:**
    * 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**  There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) on a six-sided die.  So, the probability is 3/6 = 1/2.

* **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:** There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die.  The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6.  The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 3/6.  So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

* **Difference in probabilities:** The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4. The difference is (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the number of fish in each aquarium.

* **Set up the equations:**
   *  The difference in snails is twice the number of fish:  4 - 32 = 2(x) 
   *  We know the number of snails is the same in both aquariums, so we can write: 4 + 32 = 2(x)

* **Solve for x:**
   *  Simplify the equation: -28 = 2(x)
   *  Divide both sides by 2: -14 = x

* **The answer:**
   *  There are **-14** fish in each aquarium. 


**Important Note:**  The answer is negative because the problem is asking for the number of fish in each aquarium.  This is a bit of a trick question, as it's likely there's an error in the problem setup.

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Start:** Oscar begins with 24 lollipops.
* **To school:** He eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
* **To friends:** He gives 14 lollipops, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
* **Home:** He buys twice the number he gave away, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.
* **Total:** He now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
* **Night:** He eats 3 more, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Understanding the rate:** The phone charges 1% per 3 minutes.
* **Current charge:** The phone is currently at 60% charged.
* **Target charge:** We want to know how long it takes to reach 100% (fully charged).

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the percentage of charge needed:** 100% - 60% = 40%
2. **Determine the time needed to charge the remaining percentage:** 40% charge needs to be added to the current 60%.
3. **Calculate the time:** 
   *  Since the phone charges 1% per 3 minutes, we need to find out how many 3-minute intervals it takes to reach 40%.
   *  We can use the following formula: Time = (Target Charge / Rate) * 3 minutes
   *  Time = (40% / 1%) * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

4. **Convert minutes to hours:** 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

**Answer:** It will take **2 hours** to fully charge the phone.

"Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Rewards earned:** The customer earned $1 off for every $20 spent, so for their $80 trip, they earned $1 * 80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

"Here's how to break down the calculations to figure out which job pays more:

**Job A:**

* **Gross Pay:** $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
* **Tax:** $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
* **Net Pay:** $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**

* **Net Income After Property Tax:** $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
* **Tax:** $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
* **Net Pay:** $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

**Difference in Net Pay:** $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

**Answer:** Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the number of students in each of the equal groups:**  Let's say each of the equal groups has 'x' students.

* **The size of the smallest group:** The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

* **Total students:** The total number of students is 3 groups, so we have the equation: 3x = 200

* **Solve for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 200/3 

* **Calculate the size of the smallest group:**  x - 10 = 200/3 - 10 = 200/3 - 30/3 = 170/3

* **The smallest group has 170/3 students, which is approximately 56.67 students.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know c + w = 60 (total animals)
   * We know c = 2w (twice as many chickens as cows)

* **Solve for 'c' in the second equation:**
   * c = 2w

* **Substitute this value of 'c' into the first equation:**
   * 2w + w = 60

* **Combine like terms:**
   * 3w = 60

* **Solve for 'w':**
   * w = 60 / 3
   * w = 20

* **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 2w:**
   * c = 2 * 20
   * c = 40

* **Calculate the total number of legs:**
   * Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
   * Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
   * Total legs: 80 + 80 = 160

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Frog weight:** We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
* **Blue beetle weight:** The frog weighs the same as the blue beetle. So, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
* **Green toad weight:** The frog weighs the same as the green toad. So, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
* **Yellow snake weight:** The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds less than the frog, so it weighs 50 - 10 = 40 pounds.
* **Red bird weight:** The red bird weighs 20 pounds more than the blue beetle, so it weighs 50 + 20 = 70 pounds.
* **Total weight:** The container weighs 20 pounds, and we have the weights of each animal: 50 + 50 + 50 + 40 + 70 = 260 pounds.

**Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds.**

"Here's how to figure out how many friends Morgan can invite:

* **Mini-golf cost:** $5 per person * number of people = total cost
* **Go-kart cost:** $10 per ride * 2 rides = total cost
* **Total budget:** $90
* **Arcade tokens:** $5
* **Total cost for mini-golf and go-karts:** $5 * number of people + $10 * 2 = $5 * number of people + $20

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Billy's change:**  He had $10 and spent $1.50 on candy, so he has $10 - $1.50 = $8.50 left.

2. **Calculate how many pounds of candy he bought:** He spent $8.50 on gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05, so he bought $8.50 / $0.05 = 170 gumballs.

3. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy:** Since he bought 170 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05, he spent $170 / $0.05 = 3400 dollars on gumballs.  

4. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy:**  He spent $3400 on gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05, so he bought $3400 / $0.05 = 6800 dollars on candy.  

5. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy:** He spent $6800 on candy, and each pound of candy costs $1.50, so he bought $6800 / $1.50 = 453.33 pounds of candy.

* We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, so we can write this as an equation: 2x - 5 = Carver's age.
* We know Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute that into the equation: 2x - 5 = 45.
* Now, solve for x:
    * Add 5 to both sides: 2x = 50

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:** The train travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it travels 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

* **Calculate the number of trips the train makes in a day:** The train makes 3 trips a day.
* **Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:** The train travels 225 miles * 3 trips = 675 miles in a day.
* **Calculate the number of days between services:** The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  The train travels 675 miles per day, so it needs service in 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

"Here's how to break down the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the time for the first leg of the trip.**

* Distance: 200 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the time for the detour.**

* Distance: 10 miles

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
    * The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5.
    * The number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3(4x - 5).

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of people kicked out is the sum of the three groups: x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

* **Solve the equation:**
    * 5x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50
    * 17x - 20 = 50
    * 17x = 70
    * x = 70 / 17 
    * x = 4.12 (approximately)

* **Find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:** Since we're looking for the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we can use the value of x (4.12) to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. 

* **The answer:**  We can't have a fraction of a person, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Set up the equations:**

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 (flat fee) + $5 * number of guests
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 * number of guests

**2.  Set the equations equal to each other:**

Since the cost is equal for both venues, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

**3. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Subtract $200 from both sides: $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests - $200
* Divide both sides by $5: number of guests = ($25 * number of guests - $200) / $5
* Simplify: number of guests = 5 * number of guests - 40

**4. Solve for the number of guests:**

* Add 40 to both sides: 5 * number of guests = number of guests
* Divide both sides by 5: number of guests = 8

**Answer:** 8 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**

   * David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
   * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **They get 15 more than x, so they get x + 15.**
* **The total number of corn chips for the two people is 2x + (x + 15) = 3x + 15**
* **Amora and Lainey get a total of 70 chips, so 3x + 15 = 70**
* **Subtract 15 from both sides: 3x = 55**
* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 18.33** 
* **Since we can't have a fraction of a chip, we need to adjust our thinking.**

**The problem is flawed because it doesn't make sense to have a fraction of a chip.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the cost of the tickets.**
* **The cost of the tickets is 50% more than the supplies, so the cost of the tickets is 1.50x.**
* **The total cost of the trip is the cost of supplies plus the cost of tickets:**  $400 + 1.50x 
* **We know the total cost is $400, so we can set up an equation:** $400 + 1.50x = $400
* **Solve for x:**
    * Subtract $400 from both sides: 1.50x = $0
    * Divide both sides by 1.50: x = $0

**Therefore, the travel cost is $0.**

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    * Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    * Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    * Since we know A = S + 5, substitute that into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Simplify: 2S + W = 334
    * Substitute S = 4W - 13 into the equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 334
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 334
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 334
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 360
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40 

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute W = 40 into the equation S = 4W - 13: S = 4(40) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 160 - 13
    * Calculate: S = 147

**Answer:** Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **First plane's flights:** Let's say the first plane makes 'x' number of flights per day.
* **Greece flights:** It flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* **France and Germany flights:** The remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each destination gets (1/4x)/2 = 1/8x flights.
* **Second plane's flights:** The second plane flies to Poland, and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44/2 = 22 trips.

**Let's break down the information:**

* The first plane makes 'x' flights per day.
* The first plane flies to Greece (3/4)x flights.
* The first plane flies to France and Germany (1/4x) flights each.

**To find the number of flights to France, we need to find the value of 'x'.**

* The second plane makes 22 trips to Poland. 
* The second plane makes half the number of trips the first plane makes. 
* Therefore, the first plane makes 22 * 2 = 44 trips.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.

2. **Find Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.

3. **Set up an equation:** We know the total age is 20, so (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20.

4. **Substitute known values:** We know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4.  We can substitute these values into the equation to get (3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20.

5. **Solve for Helene's age:**  We can simplify the equation to 7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20.

6. **Solve for Wilfred's age:**  We can subtract 7 from both sides to get Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 13.

7. **Find the age of Wilfred:**  We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.  We can substitute the value of Helene's age from step 6 into this equation to get 2 * (3 + 4 + Wilfred's age + 13) / 4 = Helene's age.  Simplifying this equation, we get 2 * (20 + Wilfred's age) / 4 = Helene's age.  We can solve for Wilfred's age by simplifying the equation and solving for Wilfred's age.

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.** 
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
   - We know the final charge is 28%, so we can calculate the charge after 5 hours: 28% = 0.28
   - Let 'x' be the initial charge. We know that after 5 hours, the power bank had 0.95x.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge after 5 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, so it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
   - We know the final charge is 28%, so we can calculate the charge after 5 hours: 28% = 0.28
   - Let 'x' be the initial charge. We know that after 5 hours, the power bank had 0.95x.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge after 8 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours, so it had 93% of its capacity remaining after 3 hours.
   - We know the final charge is 28%, so we can calculate the charge after 3 hours: 28% = 0.28
   - Let 'x' be the initial charge. We know that after 3 hours, the power bank had 0.93x.

* **Step 4: Calculate the initial charge.**
   - We know the power bank had 0.95x after 5 hours and 0.93x after 8 hours. 
   - We can set up an equation to solve for x: 0.95x = 0.28
   - Solving for x, we get: x = 0.28 / 0.95 = 0.294 

**Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank was approximately 0.294.**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.**
* **Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so a large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from selling large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from selling small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **To find the number of small stuffed animals, divide both sides by 20: x = 6**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **T-Rex ate half:**  Let's say the triceratops had 'x' kilograms of meat. The T-Rex ate half, leaving (x/2) kilograms.
* **Velociraptors scavenged half:** The velociraptors ate half of what was left, so they ate (x/2) / 2 = (x/4) kilograms.
* **Allosaurus ate the rest:** The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, meaning the remaining meat was (x/4) - 270 kilograms.
* **Solve for x:**  We know the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so (x/4) - 270 = 0. 
* **Solve for x:**  Add 270 to both sides: (x/4) = 270. Multiply both sides by 4: x = 1080.

**Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4 * (y - 7)' centimeters long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

**Solve for y:**

1. Combine like terms: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
2. Simplify: 6y - 35 = 37
3. Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72
4. Divide both sides by 6: y = 12

**Find the length of the red rope:**

The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so:
Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

* **We know Rissa has 6/5 of her money left:**  This means (6/5)x = (3x/2) - x
* **Solving for x:**  Simplify the equation: (6/5)x = (3x/2) - x  =>  (6/5)x - (3x/2) = -x  =>  (12/10)x - (15/10)x = -x  =>  (-3/10)x = -x  =>  (3/10)x = 0  => x = 0

**Therefore, Ronnie had $0 initially.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Find the amount of each color:** Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple, and half is yellow, we can represent the amounts as:
    * Red:  x pints
    * White: x pints
    * Purple: x pints
    * Yellow: 12 pints 

* **Set up an equation:** The total amount of paint is 12 pints, so:
    * x + x + x + 12 = 12

* **Solve for x:**
    * 3x + 12 = 12
    * 3x = 0
    * x = 0

* **Find the amount of red paint:** Since x represents the amount of each color, and we know the amount of yellow paint is 12 pints, the amount of red paint is 0 pints.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the initial amount:** Thomas begins with $1000.
2. **Calculate the number of bills after losing some:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 1000 - 10 = 990 bills.
3. **Calculate the number of bills used for the bill:** He uses half of the remaining bills, which is 990 / 2 = 495 bills.
4. **Calculate the remaining amount:** He has 990 - 495 = 495 bills left.
5. **Calculate the amount after tripling:**  He triples his money, so he now has 495 * 3 = 1485 bills.
6. **Calculate the number of 5 dollar bills:**  He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  Since each bill is worth $5, he has 1485 / 5 = 297 5 dollar bills.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
    * Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"":  W = 5(C + 7) 
    * ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": W + 25 = (3/1) * (W + 25)

* **Solve the equations:**
    * Substitute the first equation into the second equation: 5(C + 7) + 25 = (3/1) * (W + 25)
    * Simplify and solve for C: 5C + 35 + 25 = 3W + 75
    * Combine like terms: 5C + 60 = 3W + 75
    * Substitute the first equation (W = 5(C + 7)) into the equation above: 5C + 60 = 3(5(C + 7)) + 75
    * Simplify and solve for C: 5C + 60 = 15C + 60 + 75
    * Combine like terms: 5C + 60 = 15C + 135

* **Calculate the cost of one bottle of cognac:**  Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, let's say the cost of one bottle of scotch is $x.  The cost of one bottle of cognac is then $x + (0.50 * x) = 1.50x.
* **Calculate the number of cognac bottles:** John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 bottles * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.
* **Calculate the total cost of cognac:** The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * 1.50x = 30x.
* **Calculate the total cost:** The total cost of everything is 10 bottles * $x + 20 bottles * 1.50x = 10x + 30x = 40x.
* **Solve for x:** We know the total cost is $600, so 40x = $600.  Dividing both sides by 40 gives us x = $15.

**Therefore, the cost of one bottle of scotch is $15.**

**Final answer:** $600

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.**

We know:

* **b = 3c - 2** (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)

We also know:

* **Each person gets 2 treats.**
* **The class has 5 people.**

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to figure out how many treats Carly made in total and then divide that by the number of people.

**Here's how to solve it:**

1. **Calculate the total number of treats:**
   * Carly made 'c' cupcakes, and each person gets 2, so she made 2c treats.
   * Total treats: 2c

2. **Calculate the total number of brownies:**
   * Carly made 'b' brownies, and each person gets 2, so she made 2b treats.
   * Total treats: 2b

3. **Set up an equation:**
   * The total number of treats is 2c + 2b = 10 (since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people)

4. **Substitute the value of 'b' from the first equation:**
   * 2c + 2(3c - 2) = 10

5. **Solve for 'c':**
   * 2c + 6c - 4 = 10
   * 8c - 4 = 10
   * 8c = 14
   * c = 1.75

**Since we can't have half a cupcake, we need to re-evaluate the problem.**

   * We know Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: S = K + 12
   * We know Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: S = K + 8

* **Solve for Kim's paintings (K):**
   * Since we know S = K + 12 and S = K + 8, we can set these two equations equal to each other: K + 12 = K + 8
