"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understand the ratio:** The ratio 7:13 means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.
* **Find the unit:** We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* **Use the ratio:**  Since the ratio is 7:13, we can figure out how many cups of water she used. 
* **Calculate:**  We can set up a proportion to find the number of cups of water: 
   * (7/13) = (120 teaspoons / x cups)
* **Solve for x:** Cross-multiply and solve for x. 
   * 7 * x = 13 * 120
   * 7x = 1560
   * x = 1560 / 7
   * x = 220 cups of water

**Now, we know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.**

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know w = r + 2 (Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens)
   * We know the total eggs from red and white chickens is 42: 3r + 5w = 42

* **Solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**
   * Since we know w = r + 2, we can substitute that into the second equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
   * Simplify: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   * Combine like terms: 8r + 10 = 42
   * Subtract 10 from both sides: 8r = 32
   * Divide both sides by 8: r = 4

* **Answer:** Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"Gary walks around the whole park.  The park is a rectangle, so he walks around all four sides.  

To find out how long it takes him, we need to know how long each side is.  The park is 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide.

To find the total distance, we need to add the length and width together. 1.5 miles + 6 miles = 7.5 miles.

Now we can figure out how long it takes him to walk the whole park.  He walks 3 miles per hour.  

So, he walks for 7.5 miles / 3 miles per hour = 2.5 hours.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'x' be the amount of water in the small pool.
   * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Water lost:**
   * Both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, so in 4 minutes, they lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **New amounts:**
   * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
   * The small pool now has x gallons.

* **Total water lost:**
   * The total water lost is 16 gallons.

* **Setting up the equation:**
   * The total water in the small pool is now 8x - 16 = x.

* **Solving for x:**
   * 8x - 16 = x
   * 7x = 16
   * x = 16 / 7

"To figure this out, we need to know how many cups of flour are needed for one dozen cookies.  

We know that two cups of flour make a dozen cookies. 

* Carla wants to bake 36 cookies today. 
* She wants to bake 30 cookies tomorrow.

Let's figure out how many cups of flour she needs for each day. 

* **Today:** 36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozens of cookies
* **Tomorrow:** 30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozens of cookies

Now, let's add the flour needed for today and tomorrow. 

* **Total flour needed:** 3 dozens * 2 cups per dozen = 6 cups of flour
* **Total flour needed:** 2.5 dozens * 2 cups per dozen = 5 cups of flour

**Total flour needed:** 6 cups + 5 cups = 11 cups of flour

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.

* **We know:**
    * Offense has twice as many players as defense:  Offense = 2 * x
    * Special teams have half as many players as defense: Special teams = Defense / 2

* **Total players:**  We know the total number of players is 105: Offense + Defense + Special teams = 105

* **Now we can set up an equation:**
    * 2x + x + (Defense / 2) = 105

* **Let's solve for 'x':**
    * 3x + (Defense / 2) = 105
    * (Defense / 2) = 105 - 3x
    * Defense = 210 - 6x

* **We know Defense is a whole number, so we need to find a value for 'x' that makes this true.** 

* **We can try some numbers:**  Let's try x = 10. 
    * Defense = 210 - 6 * 10 = 150

"Here's how to solve this:

* **We know the phone is at 60% charged.**  
* **It charges 1% per 3 minutes.**
* **To get to 100% (fully charged), we need to add 40% more charge.**

**Let's think about it like this:**

* If the phone charges 1% every 3 minutes, it will take 3 minutes to charge 1%
* To get to 100%, we need to add 40% more charge. 
* We need to figure out how many 3-minute intervals it will take to add 40% to the phone's charge. 

**Here's how to calculate that:**

* 40% of 100% is 40/100 * 100 = 40%
* 40% is the same as 40/100 = 0.4
* We need to figure out how many 3-minute intervals it will take to add 0.4 to the phone's charge. 
* 0.4 / (1/3) = 1.2 
* 1.2 is the number of 3-minute intervals it will take to add 40% to the phone's charge. 


**Therefore, it will take 1.2 * 3 = 3.6 minutes to fully charge the phone.**

    *  c = 2k (Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows)

* **Now we can solve for the number of cows:**
    *  Since c = 2k, we can substitute that into the first equation: 2k + k = 60
    *  Combine the 'k's: 3k = 60
    *  Divide both sides by 3: k = 20 

* **Now we know there are 20 cows.**

* **Let's find the number of chickens:**
    *  c = 2k, so c = 2 * 20 = 40

* **Now we know there are 40 chickens.**

* **Let's find the total number of legs:**
    *  Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs.
    *  Total legs = (40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken) + (20 cows * 4 legs/cow) = 80 + 80 = 160

**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Frog's weight:** The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
* **Blue beetle's weight:** The frog weighs the same as the blue beetle. So, the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds.
* **Green toad's weight:** The frog weighs the same as the green toad. So, the green toad weighs 50 pounds.
* **Yellow snake's weight:** The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds less than the frog, so it weighs 50 - 10 = 40 pounds.
* **Red bird's weight:** The red bird weighs 20 pounds more than the blue beetle, so it weighs 50 + 20 = 70 pounds.
* **Total weight:** The container weighs 20 pounds, and the animals weigh 50 + 50 + 50 + 40 + 70 = 260 pounds.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' be the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
    * We know 4x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.
    * Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence, so 3 * (4x - 5) = 12x - 15 people were kicked out for physical violence.

* **Total people kicked out:** x + (4x - 5) + (12x - 15) = 50

* **Combine like terms:** 17x - 20 = 50

* **Solve for x:** 17x = 70
    * x = 70 / 17 
    * x = 4.12 (approximately)

* **We can't have a fraction of a person, so let's think about the problem differently:**

* **Think about the total number of people kicked out:** 50 people were kicked out in total.
* **We know the number of people kicked out for each reason:**
    * Refusing to wear masks: x = 4.12
    * Shoplifting: 4x - 5 = 4 * 4.12 - 5 = 16.48 - 5 = 11.48
    * Physical violence: 12x - 15 = 12 * 4.12 - 15 = 49.44 - 15 = 34.44

"If Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and has 12.8 hectares left, we can think of it like this:

* He had 12.8 hectares left after selling some land.
* We need to find out how much land he had before selling.

To do this, we can think of the land he sold as a part of the whole. 

Let's say he had 'x' hectares of land at first. 

* He sold 3/5 of 'x' hectares, which is (3/5) * x hectares.
* This left him with 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write an equation:

(x - (3/5) * x) = 12.8

Let's solve for x:

* (4/5) * x = 12.8
* x = 12.8 * (5/4)
* x = 16 hectares

"Here's how to figure out how many guests are needed for the two venues to be the same price:

**Let's break it down:**

* **Venue 1:**
    * Cost: $200 (flat fee) + $5 per person * number of guests
* **Venue 2:**
    * Cost: $25 per person * number of guests

**To make the costs equal, we need to find the number of guests where the two costs are the same.**

**Let's set up an equation:**

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

**Now, let's solve for the number of guests:**

1. Subtract $200 from both sides: $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests - $200
2. Subtract $25 * number of guests from both sides: $5 * number of guests - $25 * number of guests = - $200
3. Factor out a $5 * number of guests: $5 * (number of guests - 5) = - $200
4. Divide both sides by $5: (number of guests - 5) = - $200 / $5
5. Simplify: (number of guests - 5) = -40
6. Add 5 to both sides: number of guests = -40 + 5
7. Simplify: number of guests = -35

   * Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills.
   * He also has 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills.
   * Total money: $40 + $120 = $160

* **Step 2: Find how much Ali gives his sister.**
   * Ali gives his sister half of his total money, so he gives her $160 / 2 = $80.

* **Step 3: Find the amount of money Ali has left after giving his sister money.**
   * Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

* **Step 4: Find how much money Ali spends on dinner.**
   * Ali spends 3/5 of his remaining money on dinner, so he spends $80 * (3/5) = $48.

* **Step 5: Find the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner.**
   * Ali has $80 - $48 = $32 left.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Wooden figures:** Peter spent $5/figure * number of figures = total cost for wooden figures.
* **Money left:**  He started with $70 and spent $5/figure * number of figures on wooden figures.
* **Money for plastic figures:** He has $70 - (total cost of wooden figures) left.
* **Plastic figures:** He can buy $2/figure * number of figures with the remaining money.

**To find the number of wooden figures, we need to know how many he bought.** 

Let's say Peter bought 'x' number of wooden figures. 

* **Total cost of wooden figures:** $5x
* **Money left after buying wooden figures:** $70 - $5x

**To find the number of plastic figures, we need to know how much money he has left.**

* **Money for plastic figures:** $70 - $5x

**We can now solve for the number of plastic figures.** 

Let's say Peter bought 'y' number of plastic figures. 

* **Total cost of plastic figures:** $2y
* **Money left after buying plastic figures:** $70 - $5x - $2y

**We know that the total cost of the figures is equal to the total money he has.**

* $5x + $2y = $70

**We also know that Peter has $70 at the start of the week.**

"Let's break this down!

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
    * Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 'b - 0.01b' red jelly beans.
    * Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are 'b + 0.01b' green jelly beans.

* **Total jelly beans:**
    * The total number of jelly beans is 'b + (b - 0.01b) + (b + 0.01b) = 4500'

* **Solve for 'b':**
    * Combine like terms: 3b + 0.02b = 4500

    * Divide both sides by 3.02: b = 1490

* **Find the difference in green and red jelly beans:**
    * Green jelly beans: b + 0.01b = 1490 + 0.01 * 1490 = 1490.14

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Pork cooking time:** Pork took 20 minutes longer than rice, so it took 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
* **Combined cooking time of rice and pork:**  Rice and pork took 30 minutes + 50 minutes = 80 minutes.
* **Cooking time for beans:** Beans took half the time of rice and pork, so it took 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.
* **Total cooking time:**  The total time to cook all the food was 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 's' be the number of sheep.
   * Let 'g' be the number of geese.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  We know the total number of legs is 70: 4s + 2g = 70  (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
   *  We know the total number of heads is 20: s + g = 20

* **Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**
   * Solve the second equation for 's': s = 20 - g

* **Substitute to find the number of sheep:**
   * Substitute this value of 's' into the first equation: 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

* **Solve for 'g':**
   * 80 - 4g + 2g = 70
   * -2g = -10
   * g = 5  (There are 5 geese)

* **Find the number of sheep:**
   * Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g: s = 20 - 5 = 15

**Answer:** There are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 't' be the age of the twin.
    * Let '3' be the age of one of the triplets.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so the triplet's age is '3 + 7 = 10 years old'.
    * The combined ages are 44, so the twin's age plus the triplet's age is 44.

* **Solve for the twin's age:**
    * The twin's age is 44 - 10 = 34 years old.

"Okay, let's solve this problem!

* **Step 1: Find the total tea drunk by the first group of students.**
   * Each student drank 1.5 quarts, and there are 4 students, so they drank 1.5 * 4 = 6 quarts of tea.

* **Step 2: Find the total tea drunk by the second group of students.**
   * Each student drank 2 quarts, and there are 16 students, so they drank 2 * 16 = 32 quarts of tea.

* **Step 3: Find the total tea drunk in total.**
   * The first group drank 6 quarts, and the second group drank 32 quarts, so they drank a total of 6 + 32 = 38 quarts of tea.

* **Step 4: Find the total tea at the beginning.**
   * We have 10 quarts left, and we know they drank 38 quarts, so there were 10 + 38 = 48 quarts at the beginning.

* **Step 5: Convert quarts to gallons.**
   * There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so there were 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea at the beginning.

"Here's how we can solve this:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest Tanya uses.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt she uses.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of oil she uses.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    *  We know Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    *  We know Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so z = 2y.

* **Now we can find the amount of oil:**
    *  We know Tanya uses 10 ounces of the scrub.
    *  We know y = 2x and z = 2y, so we can substitute to find z.
    *  Since x = zest, we can substitute to find z.

* **Let's solve for z:**
    *  z = 2 * (2x) = 4x
    *  Since x = zest, we can substitute to find z.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'S' represent the number of cards Smendrick has.
    * Let 'P' represent the number of cards PJ has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has S + 12 cards.
    * Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so S = 3P.
    * The total number of cards is 341: S + P + Becca = 341

* **Now we can solve for Becca's cards:**
    * Substitute the value of S from the second equation into the third equation:  (3P) + P + (S + 12) = 341
    * Simplify: 4P + S + 12 = 341
    * Since S = 3P, substitute that in: 4P + 3P + 12 = 341
    * Combine like terms: 7P + 12 = 341
    * Subtract 12 from both sides: 7P = 329
    * Divide both sides by 7: P = 47

* **Find Becca's cards:**
    * S = 3P, so S = 3 * 47 = 141
    * Becca has S + 12 cards, so Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

    * My brother's age is ""x + 3"" (3 years younger than me)
    * My sister's age is ""x - 2"" (2 years younger than me)

* **Mom's age:**
    * Mom's age is ""3 * (x + 3) - 1"" (one less than three times my brother's age)

* **Total age:**
    * x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3 * (x + 3) - 1) = 87

* **Now we can solve for x:**
    * 3x + 4 + 3x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
    * 9x + 10 = 87
    * 9x = 77
    * x = 8.56 (We can't have a fraction of a year, so there might be an error in the problem)

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is written.**

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Day 1:** 10 people are infected. Each infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people get infected.
* **Day 2:** 60 people are infected. Each infects 6 others, so 60 * 6 = 360 new people get infected.
* **Day 3:** 360 people are infected. Each infects 6 others, so 360 * 6 = 2160 new people get infected.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'F' represent the number of books Fawn has.
    * Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has 'F - 12' books.
    * Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has 'F - 12 + 25' books.

* **Total books:**  The total number of books is the sum of their books: F + (F - 12) + (F - 25) = 85

* **Solve for F:**
    * Combine like terms: 3F - 37 = 85
    * Add 37 to both sides: 3F = 122
    * Divide both sides by 3: F = 40.67

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Indoor plants:** Mrs. Smith has 100 plants / 4 = 25 indoor plants.
2. **Plants left:** She has 100 plants - 25 plants = 75 plants left.
3. **Outdoor plants:** Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so there are 75 plants * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.
4. **Flowering plants:** The rest of the plants are flowering plants, so there are 75 plants - 50 plants = 25 flowering plants.
5. **Percent of flowering plants:**  (25 flowering plants / 100 total plants) * 100% = 25%

**Answer:** 25%

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Thingamabob speed:** If a whatchamacallit spins 121 meters per second, and spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can figure out the thingamabob's speed.
* **Thingamabob speed:**  Let's say the thingamabob spins at 'x' meters per second.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
    * Let Paul's age be represented by 'P' + 10 (since he's 10 years older than John)
    * Let John's age be represented by 'J'

* **Set up an equation:**
    * P + P + J = 100  (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100)

* **We know P = J + (P + 10)** (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Substitute to solve for P:**
    *  P + P + J = 100
    *  2P + J = 100
    *  Since we know P = J + (P + 10), we can substitute that in:
    *  2(J + (P + 10)) + J = 100
    *  2J + 2P + 20 + J = 100

    * Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    * Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Now we can solve for Stan's catch:**
    * Since we know A = S + 5, we can substitute that into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Simplify: 2S + W + 5 = 339
    * We also know S = 4W - 13, so substitute that in: 2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 21 = 339
    * Add 21 to both sides: 9W = 360
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40 

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Now that we know W (Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon), we can find S (Stan's catch): S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

**Answer:** Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the distance flown south.**
   * The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so she flies 10 * 30 = 300 miles.

* **Step 2: Calculate the distance flown north.**
   * The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so she flies 2 * 18 = 36 miles.

* **First plane's flights:** The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights.
* **Flights to France and Germany:** The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of those countries gets 1/2 of the remaining flights.
* **Poland flights:** The other plane flies to Poland, and it makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.

**Let's break it down:**

1. **Let's say the first plane makes 'x' flights in a day.**
2. **The first plane flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.**
3. **The remaining flights are (1/2)x flights to France and Germany.**
4. **The other plane flies to Poland for 44 trips, which is half of the first plane's flights.**

**To find the number of flights to France, we need to find the value of 'x'.**

**We know the other plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips.**

**Now we can find the number of flights to France:**

* **The first plane flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.**
* **The remaining flights are (1/2)x flights to France and Germany.**
* **The total number of flights is x.**

**We know the other plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so he howls for 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.
* **Total time for Tobias and Chikote:** Together, they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time is 60 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Convert to minutes:** There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the total howl time is 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the average age:**  The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.
2. **Calculate Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so she is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.
3. **Set up an equation:** We know the total age is 20, so (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20.
4. **Substitute known values:** We know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4.  We also know Helene is twice the average age.  Let's call the average age ""x"".  So, Helene's age is 2x.
5. **Solve for x:**  The total age is 20, so 3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20.  
6. **Simplify and solve for Wilfred's age:** 7 + 2x = 20.  Therefore, 2x = 13, and x = 6.5.
7. **Calculate Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so she is 2 * 6.5 = 13 years old.
8. **Calculate Wilfred's age:**  We know the total age is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene.  We can now find Wilfred's age.

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the charge loss after 5 hours.**
   * The power bank lost 9% of its charge in the first 5 hours. 

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after 5 hours.**
   *  Let's say the power bank had a full charge of 100%. 
   *  After 5 hours, it lost 9% of its charge, so it had 100 - (9/100) * 100 = 91% of its charge left.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge loss after 8 hours.**
   * The power bank lost 7% of its charge for the next 3 hours.
   *  After 8 hours, it lost 7% of its charge, so it had 91 - (7/100) * 91 = 83.73% of its charge left.

* **Step 4: Calculate the charge remaining after 8 hours.**
   * The power bank had 83.73% of its charge left after 8 hours.

* **Step 5: Calculate the initial charge.**
   * The power bank had 28% of its charge remaining after 11 hours. 
   *  We can use this information to calculate the initial charge. 


**Final Answer: 100%**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
    * Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

* **We know the price:**
    * Each large stuffed animal costs 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.

* **We know the total earnings:**
    * Teresa earned $120 from the sales.

* **Let's set up an equation:**
    * The earnings from large stuffed animals are x * $12.
    * The earnings from small stuffed animals are 2x * $4.
    * The total earnings are x * $12 + 2x * $4 = $120

* **Solve the equation:**
    * 12x + 8x = $120
    * 20x = $120
    * x = $120 / 20
    * x = 6

* **Find the number of small stuffed animals:**
    * Teresa sold 2x small stuffed animals, so she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.


**Answer:** Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Look for the relationship:** The prices are proportional, which means the number of sandwiches and the price are related in a way that if you double the number of sandwiches, the price also doubles.
* **Find the price per sandwich:**
    * The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so each sandwich costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.
    * The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so each sandwich costs $6 / 4 = $1.50.
* **Calculate the price of the 8-sandwich package:**
    * Since each sandwich costs $1.50, the 8-sandwich package will cost 8 * $1.50 = $12.00.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Substitute Teacher:**  There's a 50% chance the homework won't be collected.
* **Normal Teacher:** There's a 40% chance she'll give an extension.
* **Dog Ate Homework:** There's a 20% chance Marcus can get an extension.

To find the total chance of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the possibilities:

* **No extension, no substitute:** 100% - 40% = 60%
* **No extension, substitute:** 50% * 100% = 50%
* **Extension:** 40% * 100% = 40%
* **Extension, dog ate homework:** 20% * 100% = 20%

Now, let's add up the chances: 60% + 50% + 40% + 20% = **170%**

Wait! That doesn't make sense.  The total chance of something happening can't be more than 100%.  

**The problem is that the percentages don't add up correctly.  **

"Let's break this down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' be the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

* **Set 1:** Rory retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls in the first set.

* **Set 3:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls in the third set.

* **Total balls:** The total number of balls is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = 3.75

* **Find the number of balls in the first set:** Since x represents the number of balls in the second set, Rory retrieved 3.75 balls in the second set. 

* **The answer:**  Rory retrieved 3.75 + 4 = 7.75 balls in the first set.

"To figure out how much it will cost, we need to know how many tiles we need.  

First, we need to find the area of one tile.  Since each tile is 1 foot long, and the floor is 200 square feet, we need to find out how many tiles will fit in that space. 

To do that, we can divide the total area by the area of one tile: 200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles.

Now, we know we need 200 tiles.  We can multiply that number by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

"Let's think about this like a race! 

* Donovan's part is like a shorter race.
* Betsy's part is like a longer race.

We know the total time for the meal is 98 minutes.  

Let's use some math to find Betsy's part:

* Let's say Donovan's part took 'x' minutes.
* Betsy's part took 'x + 18' minutes.

Together, their parts took 98 minutes:
x + (x + 18) = 98

Now we can solve for x:
2x + 18 = 98
2x = 80
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes.

Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'x' be the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.
   * Let 'y' be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs together, so they painted a total of 2x eggs.
   * Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so we can write the equation: y + 12 = 30.
   * The total number of eggs painted is 56, so: x + x + y + y = 56

* **Solve for y:**
   * From the equation y + 12 = 30, we can find that y = 18.

* **Solve for x:**
   * Substitute the value of y into the equation x + x + y + y = 56.
   * This gives us: x + x + 18 + 18 = 56
   * Combining like terms: 2x + 36 = 56
   * Subtracting 36 from both sides: 2x = 20
   * Dividing both sides by 2: x = 10

* **Find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:**
   * Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so he painted 12 more than Arnold.
   * Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold, so the answer is 12.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use letters to represent the lengths:**
    *  Let 'y' be the length of the yellow rope.
    *  Let 'b' be the length of the blue rope.
    *  Let 'r' be the length of the red rope.

* **We know:**
    *  r = 4b  (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
    *  b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)

* **We also know:**
    *  y + b + r = 37 (The combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters)

* **Now we can use these equations to solve for the length of the red rope (r):**

    1. **Substitute the value of 'b' from the second equation into the third equation:**
       y + (y - 7) + r = 37

    2. **Simplify the equation:**
       2y - 7 + r = 37

    3. **Substitute the value of 'r' from the first equation into the simplified equation:**
       2y - 7 + 4(y - 7) = 37

    4. **Simplify and solve for 'y':**
       2y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
       6y - 35 = 37
       6y = 72
       y = 12  (The length of the yellow rope)

    5. **Now that you know 'y', you can find the length of the blue rope:**
       b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 (The length of the blue rope)

    6. **Finally, find the length of the red rope:**
       r = 4b = 4 * 5 = 20 (The length of the red rope)

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let Colin's current age be ""C""
   * Let Wendy's current age be ""W""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"":  W = 5(C + 7) 
   * ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": W + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

* **Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

   1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
      (5(C + 7)) + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

   2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
      5C + 35 + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)
      5C + 60 = (1/3)(W + 25)
      15C + 180 = W + 25
      15C - W = -155 

   3. **We can use the first equation to solve for W:**
      W = 5(C + 7)
      W = 5C + 35

   4. **Substitute this value of W into the equation from step 2:**
      15C - (5C + 35) = -155
      10C - 35 = -155
      10C = -120
      C = -12

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Find the cost of one bottle of cognac:**  Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, let's say one bottle of scotch costs $x.  Then one bottle of cognac costs $x + ($0.50 * x) = $1.50x.
* **Find the number of cognac bottles:** John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 bottles * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.
* **Calculate the total cost of cognac:** He spends 20 bottles * $1.50x per bottle = $30x on cognac.
* **Calculate the total cost:**  The total cost of scotch is $600, and the total cost of cognac is $30x.  So, the total cost is $600 + $30x.
* **Solve for x:** We know that $600 is the total cost, so we can solve for x.  We have the equation $600 = $600 + $30x.  Subtracting $600 from both sides gives us $0 = $30x.  Dividing both sides by $30 gives us x = 0.  This means that the cost of one bottle of cognac is $0.  

**Final Answer:**  $0

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.
   * Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know that b = 3c - 2  (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)
   * We also know that each person gets 2 treats, so Carly needs to make enough for 5 people.

* **Solve for the number of cupcakes:**
   * Since each person gets 2 treats, Carly needs to make enough for 5 people, so she needs to make 5 * 2 = 10 treats.
   * We can now use the equation b = 3c - 2 to find the number of brownies. 
   * We know that b + c = 10 (the total number of treats)
   * We can substitute the value of b from the first equation into the second equation: (3c - 2) + c = 10
   * Simplify the equation: 4c - 2 = 10
   * Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12
   * Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

* **Answer:** Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let's use 'x' to represent the number of strawberry cubes.**

* **Blueberry cubes are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4:**  This means the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

* **Total ice cubes are 116:**  So, x (strawberry cubes) + (5x - 4) (blueberry cubes) = 116

**Now we can solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116
2. Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120
3. Divide both sides by 6: x = 20

**Now that we know x (strawberry cubes) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:**
