**Understanding the Ratio:**

The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

**Setting up the Equation:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water used.

The ratio can be expressed as: 7/13 = 120 teaspoons / x cups

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations:

* Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

We know:

* **w = r + 2** (Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens)
* **3r + 5w = 42** (The total number of eggs produced)

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* **3r + 5(r + 2) = 42**

Simplify and solve for 'r':

* **3r + 5r + 10 = 42**
* **8r + 10 = 42**
* **8r = 32**
* **r = 4**

Therefore, Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the initial amount of water in the small pool.
    *  The big pool had twice the water of the small pool, so it had 2x gallons initially.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so they lose a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so after the leak, the big pool has 2x + 16 gallons.
    * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Solve for x:**
    * We know the big pool has 4 times the water of the small pool, so 2x + 16 = 4(x - 16)
    * Simplify the equation: 2x + 16 = 4x - 64
    * Combine like terms: 80 = 2x
    * Solve for x: x = 40

**Answer:** The small pool has 40 gallons of water now.

"Let's break down this problem using variables to represent Ruby's and Sam's current ages.

* Let Ruby's current age be represented by ""R""
* Let Sam's current age be represented by ""S""

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** R = 6S  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **Equation 2:** R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for S (Sam's current age). 

**Solve for R in Equation 1:**
R = 6S

**Substitute R in Equation 2:**
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Simplify and solve for S:**
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

**1. Find the speed of the car in the slow lane:**

* The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

**2. Use the formula: distance = speed * time**

* We know the distance (480 miles) and the speed of the car in the fast lane.  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.**

* **David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.**

* **Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.**

* **Together they found 43 insects, so x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43**

* **Combine like terms: 3x/2 + 7 = 43**

* **Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x/2 = 36**

* **Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 72**

* **Divide both sides by 3: x = 24**

* **David found x/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of 2x4 pieces Frederick buys.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of 2x8 pieces Frederick buys.

*  Cost constraint: 4x + 6y ≤ 24 (The total cost of the wood cannot exceed $24)
*  Quantity constraint: 2x + 8y ≥ 400 (The total number of sticks must be at least 400)
*  We also need to express the quantity constraint in terms of x and y. 

**3. Solve the Equations:**

*  The quantity constraint can be rewritten as: 2x + 8y ≥ 400
*  Solve for x: x ≥ (400 - 8y) / 2
*  Substitute this value of x into the cost constraint: 4 * (400 - 8y) / 2 + 6y ≤ 24

**4. Simplify and Solve:**

*  Simplify the cost constraint: 800 - 16y + 6y ≤ 24
*  Combine like terms: -10y ≤ -776

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 's' represent the number of sheep.**
* **Let 'g' represent the number of geese.**

We know:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way:

1. **Solve for 's' in the second equation:** 
   s = 20 - g

2. **Substitute this value of 's' into the first equation:**
   4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'g':**
   80 - 4g + 2g = 70
   -2g = -10
   g = 5

4. **Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g:**
   s = 20 - 5
   s = 15

**Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.**

* **Dora's father's age:** Let's represent Dora's father's age as ""F"".  We know that his age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so: F = 2D + 8
* **Dora's mother's age:** Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is F - 4.
* **Total combined age:**  We need to find the total age of Dora, her father, and her mother. This is: D + F + (F - 4)

**Now, let's plug in Dora's age (D = 15):**

* F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest (in ounces).
    *  Since she uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, we can say the amount of fragrance is also 'x' ounces.
    *  Salt is equal to sugar, so let's say 'y' represents the amount of salt (in ounces).
    *  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so it's 2y ounces.

* **Set up an equation:**
    *  We know the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces.  
    *  This translates to: x + x + y + y = 10 

* **Simplify the equation:**
    *  2x + 2y = 10

* **Use the given information to express 'y' in terms of 'x':**
    *  We know salt is equal to sugar, so y = x.

* **Substitute 'y' into the equation:**
    *  2x + 2x = 10
    *  4x = 10

* **Solve for 'x':**
    *  x = 10/4 = 2.5 ounces

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal sells for 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.**
* **We know that Teresa earned $120 in total, so $8x + $12 * x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

"The price of the 8-sandwich package is $12. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Proportional pricing:**  The prices of the packages are proportional, meaning the number of sandwiches and the price are directly related.
* **Ratio analysis:**
    * The first package has 2 sandwiches at $3.
    * The second package has 4 sandwiches at $6.
* **Finding the missing price:**  We can find the price of the 8-sandwich package by finding the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price. 
    * The ratio of sandwiches to price for the first package is 2:3.
    * The ratio of sandwiches to price for the second package is 4:6.
    * The ratio of sandwiches to price for the third package is 8:x.
* **Solving for x:**  We can set up a proportion to find the price of the third package. 
    * 2/3 = 4/6 = 8/x
    * Cross-multiplying gives us 2 * 6 = 3 * 4 * x
    * Simplifying gives us 12 = 12x
    * Dividing both sides by 12 gives us x = 1. 
    * Therefore, the price of the third package is 8 sandwiches * $1 = $8.

* **Probability of no extension with normal teacher:** 60% (100% - 40%)
* **Probability of Marcus getting an extension:** 20%
* **Probability of Marcus getting an extension regardless of teacher:** 20%

To find the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probability of each scenario and their combined probability.

* **Scenario 1:** Substitute teacher, no extension: 0.5 * 0.60 = 0.30
* **Scenario 2:** Normal teacher, no extension: 0.5 * 0.40 = 0.20
* **Scenario 3:** Normal teacher, extension: 0.5 * 0.40 = 0.20
* **Scenario 4:** Marcus gets an extension: 0.20

The probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of each scenario: 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.20 + 0.20 = **0.90**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.**
* **The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it is x - 7 centimeters long.**
* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it is 4 * (x - 7) centimeters long.**

**The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:**
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Now, solve for x:**
x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

**The yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.**

**The blue rope is 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters long.**

**The red rope is 4 * (12 - 7) = 28 centimeters long.**

**Therefore, the length of the red rope is 28 centimeters.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be ""w""**
* **Let Colin's current age be ""c""**

We are given the following information:

* **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25) / 3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know w = 5(c + 7), we can substitute this into the second equation:
   c + 25 = (5(c + 7) + 25) / 3

2. **Simplify and solve for c:**
   * c + 25 = (5c + 35 + 25) / 3
   * c + 25 = (5c + 60) / 3
   * 3(c + 25) = 5c + 60
   * 3c + 75 = 5c + 60
   * 15 = 2c
   * c = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Let Jim's current age be represented by the variable 'j'.**
* **We know that John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out.** This means John's age 20 years ago was 2 times Jim's age 20 years ago.
* **We also know that John is currently 28 years old.**

Let's use this information to set up an equation:

* John's age 20 years ago: 28 - 20 = 8
* Jim's age 20 years ago: 8 / 2 = 4

Therefore, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out.

**Jim is currently 4 + 20 = 24 years old.**

"Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Cost per cognac bottle:**  Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so it costs 1.50 * $X (where X is the price of a scotch bottle).
* **Number of cognac bottles:** John buys twice as many cognac bottles as scotch bottles, so he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.
* **Total cost of cognac:** The total cost of cognac is 20 * ($X + 0.50X) = 20 * 1.50X = 30X
* **Total cost of everything:** The total cost of everything is 10 * $X + 30X = 10X + 30X = 40X
* **Final answer:**  We know the total cost is $600, so 40X = $600.  Solving for X, we get X = $600 / 40 = $15.

**Therefore, John spends $15 on each bottle of scotch and $15 on each bottle of cognac.  The total cost of everything is $15 * 10 + $15 * 20 = $150 + $300 = $450.**

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:** 
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.**
