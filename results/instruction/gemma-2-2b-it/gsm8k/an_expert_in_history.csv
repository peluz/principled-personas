"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let Seth's current age be represented by ""S""**
* **Let Brooke's current age be represented by ""B""**

We know:

* **S = 2B** (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* **S + B + 2 = 28** (In two years, their ages will sum to 28)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Seth's age:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:** 
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

5. **Since Brooke's age must be a whole number, we can assume there's a slight error in the problem setup.**  It's impossible for Brooke to be 8.67 years old. 

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.** 


**Final answer:**  Not possible to determine.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:** There are three numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) on a six-sided die.  The probability of rolling one of these is 3/6 = 1/2.
* **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:** There are three even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  To get the probability of two even numbers in a row, we multiply these probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.
* **Difference in probabilities:** The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4. The difference is (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4.
* **Percentage:** To express the difference as a percentage, multiply by 100%: (1/4) * 100% = 25%

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool initially.
    * The big pool initially had twice the water of the small pool, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, so in 4 minutes, they lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, meaning it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

"Here's how to figure out how many friends Morgan can invite:

* **Mini-golf cost:** $5 per person * number of people = total cost
* **Go-kart cost:** $10 per ride * number of rides = total cost
* **Total budget:** $90
* **Arcade tokens:** $5

**Let's break down the budget:**

* **Mini-golf:**  Let's say she invites 'x' friends. The cost of mini-golf for 'x' friends is 5x.
* **Go-karts:** She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.
* **Total cost:** 5x + 20

**Now, let's set up an equation to find the number of friends (x):**

5x + 20 = 90

**Solve for x:**

* 5x = 70

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Billy's change:** 
   -  He spent $10 - (the cost of the candy) = $10 - (1.5 * pounds of candy) 
2. **Calculate the cost of the gumballs:**
   - He spent $0.05 * 40 = $2.00 on gumballs.
3. **Calculate the amount of change after buying gumballs:**
   - He had $10 - $2.00 = $8.00 left.
4. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy:**
   - He spent $8.00 on gumballs, and he had $8.00 / $1.50 per pound = 5.33 pounds of candy.

**Therefore, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Calculate the distance between the third city and the first city:** The train travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it travels 100 - 50 = 50 miles.
* **Calculate the total distance for one trip:** The total distance for one trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.
* **Calculate the number of trips the train makes in a day:** The train makes 3 trips a day.
* **Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:** The train travels 225 miles * 3 trips = 675 miles in a day.
* **Calculate the number of days between services:** The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  The train travels 675 miles per day, so it needs service every 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 27 days.

"Here's how to break down the calculation:

**Step 1: Calculate the time for the initial leg of the trip.**

* Distance: 200 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the time for the detour.**

* Distance: 10 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the time for the return trip.**

* Distance: 240 miles
* Speed: 80 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the total time.**

* Total time = Time for initial leg + Time for detour + Time for return trip
* Total time = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.**
* **Four times the number of mask refusals is 4x.**
* **Five less than four times the number of mask refusals is 4x - 5.**
* **The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5.**
* **Three times the number of shoplifters is 3(4x - 5).**
* **The total number of people kicked out is x + 4x - 5 + 3(4x - 5) = 50**

Now, let's solve for x:

* **Combine like terms: 9x - 20 = 50**
* **Add 20 to both sides: 9x = 70**
* **Divide both sides by 9: x = 7.78**

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to consider the context of the problem.  It's likely that the question is asking for a whole number of people kicked out for other reasons. 

**Therefore, we can assume that the question is asking for the number of people kicked out for other reasons, which is the total number of people kicked out minus the number kicked out for mask refusal, shoplifting, and physical violence.**

**Total people kicked out: 50**
**People kicked out for mask refusal: 3**
**People kicked out for shoplifting: 4**
**People kicked out for physical violence: 3**

**Total people kicked out for other reasons: 50 - 3 - 4 - 3 = 40**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the unknown:** Let 'x' be the number of points Sara had.
* **Set up an equation:** Erin scored three times more than Sara, so Erin had 3 * x points.
* **Combine the information:** We know Erin scored 14 points and Sara scored 8.  We can write this as an equation: 3x = 14 + 8
* **Solve for x:** 3x = 22
* **Divide to find Sara's points:** x = 22 / 3 = 7.33
* **Find Erin's points:** Erin had 3 * 7.33 = 22
 
**Therefore, Erin had 22 points before.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Dora's father's age:** Let's represent Dora's age as ""D"".  Her father's age is ""2D + 8"" (twice Dora's age plus 8).
* **Dora's mother's age:** Her mother is 4 years younger than her father, so she is ""2D + 8 - 4"" or ""2D + 4"".
* **Total combined age:**  The total combined age is D + (2D + 8) + (2D + 4) = 5D + 12

Now, we know Dora is 15 years old, so:

* 5D + 12 = 15 + 15

* The Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

**2. Calculate the hiking speed:**

* Half their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
* They hiked at 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, so they hiked at 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.

**3. Calculate the total distance driven:**

* They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour, so they drove a total of 6 hours * 50 miles per hour = 300 miles.

**4. Calculate the total distance hiked:**

* They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so they hiked a total of 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles.

**5. Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot:**

* The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked: 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

"Here's how to break down the scoring to find the difference:

* **Ava's score:** 
    * Enemies: 8 more than Emma (let's say Emma jumps on 'x' enemies)
    * Berries: 3 more than Emma
    * Time: 4 seconds slower
* **Emma's score:**
    * Enemies: x enemies
    * Berries: 
    * Time: 

To calculate the difference, we need to know the number of enemies Emma jumps on and the number of berries she collects. 

**Let's assume:**

* Emma jumps on 'x' enemies.
* Emma collects 'y' berries.

**Now, let's calculate the scores:**

* **Ava's score:**
    * Enemies: 8 + x
    * Berries: y + 3
    * Time: 10 seconds (for every 1 second, 10 points)
* **Emma's score:**
    * Enemies: x
    * Berries: y
    * Time: 10 seconds (for every 1 second, 10 points)

**The difference in scores:**

* **Ava's score - Emma's score:** 
    * (8 + x) * 10 + (y + 3) * 5 - (x * 10) - (y * 10) 


**To get the final numerical answer, we need to know the values of 'x' and 'y'.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  ""She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance""  =>  x = z
    *  ""She uses twice as much oil as salt"" => z = 2y
    *  ""She uses twice as much salt as zest"" => y = 2x

* **Solve for the amount of oil (z):**
    * Since x = z, we know z = x.
    * Substitute z = x into the equation z = 2y:  z = 2x
    * Substitute z = x into the equation z = 2y:  x = 2x

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Pompei's lifting capacity:** Pompei can lift 1 inch.
* **Saskay's lifting capacity:** Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:** Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting capacity:** Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting capacity in feet:**  Since 12 inches = 1 foot, Naruto can lift 480 inches * (1 foot / 12 inches) = 40 feet.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos' speed:**  Let's assume a kangaroo travels at a speed of 'x' miles per hour.
* **Turtles' speed:** Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is 'x/2' miles per hour.

**Calculating the Time**

* **Kangaroos' distance:**  The time it takes for 3 kangaroos to travel is determined by their combined speed and distance.
* **Turtles' distance:**  The time it takes for four turtles to travel is also determined by their combined speed and distance.

**Setting up the Equation**

We know the following:

* **Kangaroos:** 3 kangaroos travel for 18 hours at a combined speed of 3x miles per hour.
* **Turtles:** Four turtles travel for an unknown time at a combined speed of 4*(x/2) = 2x miles per hour.

**Solving for Time**

To find the time it takes for the turtles, we can use the following equation:

Time = Distance / Speed

**Finding the Solution**

We need to find the distance the turtles cover in the same time it takes the kangaroos to cover the same distance. 

**Important Note:**  The problem doesn't provide the distance, so we can't calculate the exact time it takes for the turtles. 


**Final Answer:**  We cannot determine the exact time it takes for the turtles to travel.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables to represent the ages:

* **Let your age be represented by ""x""**
* **Your brother's age is ""x + 3""**
* **Your sister's age is ""x - 2""**
* **Your mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1**

Now, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Simplify the equation:

4x + 4 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 87

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 75

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 10.71

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to adjust our assumption.  Let's try a different approach. 

**Here's a more direct method:**

* **Your age is 10 years old.** 
* **Your brother is 13 years old.**
* **Your sister is 8 years old.**
* **Your mom is 3(13) - 1 = 38 years old.**

**Add up the ages:** 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69

2. **Outdoor plants:**  The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75. Two-thirds of these are outdoor, so there are 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

3. **Flowering plants:** The remaining plants are 75 - 50 = 25.

4. **Percentage of flowering plants:**  This is the number of flowering plants divided by the total number of plants, expressed as a percentage.  So, 25 / 100 = 0.25, which is equal to 25%.


**Answer:** 25%

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the speed of a thingamabob.**
* **A whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob, so its speed is 5x.**
* **A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning its speed is 11x.**
* **We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so 11x = 121 meters per second.**
* **Solve for x: x = 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.**
* **The whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob, so its speed is 5 * 11 meters per second = 55 meters per second.**

**Therefore, a whirligig spins 55 meters per second.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Joe's lawn mowing:** Let's assume Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times.
* **Kamala's lawn mowing:** She mowed Kamala's lawn three times Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.
* **Alba's lawn mowing:** She mowed Alba's lawn five times Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.
* **Total earnings from lawn mowing:**  Tasha's earnings from lawn mowing were 3x + 5x + x = 9x.
* **Total earnings from lemonade:** Her earnings from lemonade were $80.
* **Total earnings from lawn mowing:** Her total earnings from lawn mowing were 9x.
* **Equating the total earnings:** 9x + 80 = 6 * 1 
* **Solving for x:** 9x = -74
* **Solving for x:** x = -74/9. 

**Since we cannot have a negative number of lawn mowing, there must be an error in the problem statement.**

* **The number of corn chips Lainey and Amora received is 70.**
* **The other two people received x + 15 corn chips.**
* **The total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + (x + 15).**
* **We know that the total number of corn chips is equal to the number of corn chips the other two people received plus the number of corn chips Lainey and Amora received.**
* **Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 15 + 70 + 70 = total corn chips**
* **Simplifying the equation: x + 15 + 140 = total corn chips**
* **Combining like terms: x + 155 = total corn chips**
* **Since the other two people received x + 15 corn chips, we can substitute this into the equation: x + 155 = (x + 15) + 140**
* **Simplifying the equation: x + 155 = x + 255**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the cost of the travel tickets.**
* **The cost of the travel tickets is 50% more than the supplies, so the cost of the tickets is 1.50x.**
* **The total cost of the trip is the sum of the supplies and the travel tickets:**  x + 1.50x = $400
* **Combine like terms:** 2.50x = $400
* **Divide both sides by 2.50 to find the cost of the tickets:** x = $160

**Therefore, the travel tickets cost $160.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables to represent the unknown quantities:

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

* A + S + W = 339  (The total number of Pokemon caught)
* A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Now we can solve for Stan's catch:

1. **Substitute** the first equation (A = S + 5) into the second equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation (S = 4W - 13) into the simplified equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339
   2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
   9W - 21 = 339
   9W = 360
   W = 40

5. **Substitute the value of W back into the third equation to find S:**
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

6. **Finally, substitute the value of S back into the first equation to find A:**
   A + 147 + W = 339
   A + 147 + 40 = 339
   A + 187 = 339
   A = 152

**Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.**

* **Peeling:** Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute, so in 10 minutes she peels 6 * 10 = 60 shrimp.
* **Cooking:** She cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so she cooks 30 / 30 = 1 shrimp per minute.
* **Total Time:** To peel and cook 90 shrimp, it will take 90 / 60 = 1.5 minutes.

**Answer:** 1.5 minutes

"Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Low setting:** The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, resulting in a cooling of 6 degrees (3 hours * 2 degrees/hour).
* **High setting:** The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours, resulting in a cooling of 12 degrees (4 hours * 3 degrees/hour).
* **Total cooling:** The total cooling from both settings is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.
* **Room temperature:** The room was 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature after the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours.

**Final Answer:** 18 degrees

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Bill's current age be 'b'
    * Let his father's age be 'f' when Bill saw the comet the first time.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Halley orbits every 75 years.  
    * Bill saw the comet when he was 30 years old. This means his father saw it when he was 30 - 75 years = -45 years old. 
    * Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the comet the first time. This means Bill was 3 * (-45) = -135 years old.

* **The problem is flawed:**  The information provided is contradictory. It's impossible for someone to be -135 years old. 


**Final Answer:** The provided information in the question is contradictory and cannot be solved.

"Here's how to calculate the total number of checks:

* **Monthly:** 1 check (electric) + 1 check (gas) + 2 checks (church) = 4 checks
* **Quarterly:** 1 check (pest/lawn) = 1 check
* **Total:** 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks
* **Total:** 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks

**Total checks per year: 48 + 4 = 52**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **First plane's flights:** Let's represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as 'x'.
* **Flights to Greece:** The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so it flies to Greece (3/4)x times.
* **Flights to France and Germany:** The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of these destinations gets (1/2) * (x - (3/4)x) = (1/2) * (x/4) = (1/8)x flights.
* **Poland flights:** The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and it makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44 / 2 = 22 trips.

**Therefore, the first plane makes (3/4)x flights to Greece, and the remaining (x - (3/4)x) flights are split equally between France and Germany. The other plane makes 22 trips to Poland.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so her howl lasts 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* **Combined howl time:**  Tobias' howl is 20 seconds, and Chikote's is 40 seconds, so their combined howl time is 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous' howl:** Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so his howl lasts 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time of all three wolves' howls is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Minutes:**  To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Father's gift:** Adam's father gave him twice the amount his mother gave him, so he received 2 * $6 = $12.
* **Total from gifts:** Adam received a total of $6 + $12 = $18 from his gifts.
* **Adam's savings:**  To find out how much he contributed from his savings, subtract the total from his gifts from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

**Answer:** Adam contributed $12 from his savings.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.

2. **Find Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.

3. **Set up an equation:** We know the total age is 20, so (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20.

4. **Substitute known values:** We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.  We can substitute these values into the equation to get (3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20.

5. **Solve for Helene's age:**  We can simplify the equation to 7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20.  

6. **Solve for Wilfred's age:**  We can solve for Helene's age by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation.  This gives us Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 13.

7. **Find the age of Wilfred:**  We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.  We can substitute the value of Helene's age from step 6 into this equation.

8. **Calculate the age of Wilfred:**  We can solve for Wilfred's age by substituting the value of Helene's age into the equation.

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.** 
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, meaning it had 9% of its capacity left after 5 hours.
   - Let's represent the initial charge as 'x'.  After 5 hours, the power bank had 90% of its capacity left. 
   - We can set up an equation: 0.9x = 0.9 * x 
   - This means the power bank had 90% of its capacity after 5 hours.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge after 5 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours.
   - We can represent the charge after 3 hours as 'y'. 
   - We can set up an equation: 0.9y = 0.9 * y 
   - This means the power bank had 90% of its capacity after 3 hours.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge after 8 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, and then 7% for 3 hours.
   - We can represent the charge after 8 hours as 'z'. 
   - We can set up an equation: 0.9z = 0.9 * z 
   - This means the power bank had 90% of its capacity after 8 hours.

* **Step 4: Calculate the initial charge.**
   - The power bank had 28% of its capacity remaining after 8 hours.
   - We can set up an equation: 0.28 = 0.9 * z
   - Solving for z, we get z = 0.28 / 0.9 = 0.3111111111111111
   - This means the power bank had 0.3111111111111111 of its capacity remaining after 8 hours.

**Final Answer:** 0.3111111111111111

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal sells for 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is x * $12.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so x * $12 + 8x = $120**

Now we can solve for x:

* **Combine like terms: 9x = $120**
* **Divide both sides by 9: x = 13.33**

Since we can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's assume Teresa sold 13 large stuffed animals.

* **She sold 2 * 13 = 26 small stuffed animals.**


**Answer:** Teresa sold 26 small stuffed animals.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.**

* **First set:** He retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x / 2 balls.

* **Total balls:** The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Solve for x:** 
    * Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
    * Find a common denominator: (8x + 8) / 2 = 19
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 8x + 8 = 38
    * Subtract 8 from both sides: 8x = 30
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = 3.75

* **Since we can't have half a ball, there's likely an error in the problem statement.**  It's impossible to retrieve a fraction of a ball. 


**Therefore, we cannot determine the number of balls Rory retrieved in the first set with the given information.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be ""w""**
* **Let Colin's current age be ""c""**

We are given the following information:

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25)/3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know w = 5(c + 7), we can substitute this into the second equation:
   c + 25 = (5(c + 7) + 25)/3

2. **Simplify and solve for c:**
   * c + 25 = (5c + 35 + 25)/3

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:** 
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5
