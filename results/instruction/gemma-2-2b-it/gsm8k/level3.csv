"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* We know the team played 22 games.
* They won more than they lost. This means we need to find the number of wins and losses.

**Setting up the Equations**

Let:

*  'x' represent the number of games they lost.
* 'x + 8' represent the number of games they won.

**The Equation**

The total number of games played is the sum of wins and losses: x + (x + 8) = 22

"Here's how to break down the problem to find the solution:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'w' represent the cost of a watermelon.
* Let 'p' represent the cost of a pepper.
* Let 'o' represent the cost of an orange.

**2. Set up Equations:**

* We know that a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs:  w = 3p
* We also know that an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon: o = w - 5

**3.  Express the Total Cost:**

* Total cost = (cost of watermelons) + (cost of peppers) + (cost of oranges)
* Total cost = 4w + 20p + 10o

**4. Substitute and Solve:**

* Substitute the values of 'w' and 'o' from the equations above into the total cost equation:
   Total cost = 4(3p) + 20p + 10(w - 5)
* Simplify: Total cost = 12p + 20p + 10w - 50
* Since we know w = 3p, substitute that in: Total cost = 12p + 20p + 10(3p) - 50
* Simplify further: Total cost = 12p + 20p + 30p - 50
* Total cost = 62p - 50

**5. Calculate the Total Cost:**

* Since each pepper costs $15, we can find the total cost:
   Total cost = 62 * 15 - 50
   Total cost = 930 - 50
   Total cost = $880

**Final Answer:** Dillon will spend $880 at the store.

"Here's how to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months:

**Understanding the Problem**

The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means we need to calculate the price after each two-month period and then compound the results.

**Calculation**

* **Month 1:** The price increases by 20% of $20, which is $4.  The new price is $20 + $4 = $24.
* **Month 2:** The price increases by 20% of $24, which is $4.8. The new price is $24 + $4.8 = $28.8.
* **Month 3:** The price increases by 20% of $28.8, which is $5.8. The new price is $28.8 + $5.8 = $34.64.
* **Month 4:** The price increases by 20% of $34.64, which is $6.93. The new price is $34.64 + $6.93 = $41.57.
* **Month 5:** The price increases by 20% of $41.57, which is $8.31. The new price is $41.57 + $8.31 = $50.88.
* **Month 6:** The price increases by 20% of $50.88, which is $10.18. The new price is $50.88 + $10.18 = $61.06.
* **Month 7:** The price increases by 20% of $61.06, which is $12.21. The new price is $61.06 + $12.21 = $73.27.
* **Month 8:** The price increases by 20% of $73.27, which is $14.65. The new price is $73.27 + $14.65 = $87.92.
* **Month 9:** The price increases by 20% of $87.92, which is $17.59. The new price is $87.92 + $17.59 = $105.51.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
* Let 'y' represent the cost of lemons.

**2. Set up the Equations:**

* **Revenue:**  They sell 20 glasses per gallon, and each glass is $0.50, so their revenue is 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon.
* **Cost:** Each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so their total cost is 3x + 2y.
* **Profit:** Their profit is their revenue minus their cost: $25.

**3. Formulate the Equation:**

The profit equation is: 10x - (3x + 2y) = 25

**4. Solve for the Cost of Lemons:**

* Simplify the equation: 7x - 2y = 25
* We need to find the value of 'y' (the cost of lemons).  We can do this by isolating 'y' in the equation. 
* Add 2y to both sides: 7x = 25 + 2y
* Divide both sides by 2: 3.5x = 12.5 + y
* Since we know that they sell 20 glasses per gallon, we can express the cost of lemons in terms of 'x'. 
*  y = 3.5x - 12.5

**5. Find the Number of Gallons:**

* We know that they made $25 in profit. 
* We can use the revenue equation to find the number of gallons they made.
* 10x = 25 + 2y
* Substitute the value of 'y' we found: 10x = 25 + 2(3.5x - 12.5)
* Simplify and solve for 'x': 10x = 25 + 7x - 25
* Combine like terms: 3x = 0
* Solve for 'x': x = 0

**6. Calculate the Cost of Lemons:**

* Since we found that they made 0 gallons, the cost of lemons is 0. 

**Answer:** They spent $0 on lemons.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'r' represent the number of rats.
* Let 'h' represent the number of hamsters.
* Let 'b' represent the number of rabbits.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* **Rats:**  We know 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents.  
   * Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so r rats * 6 pieces/rat = 6r
   * We know 160 pieces were distributed among the rats, so 6r = 160
* **Hamsters:** We know there are 10 cages of hamsters, each with 5 pieces of straw.
   * 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw for hamsters
   * We know there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters, so 50 = 5h
* **Rabbits:** We know there are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

**3. Solve for the Number of Rats:**

* We have two equations:
    * 6r = 160
    * 50 = 5h
* Solve for 'r' in the first equation:
    * r = 160 / 6 = 26.67 
* Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to adjust our thinking.  

**4. Analyze the Problem:**

* The problem states that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. This means the number of rats in each cage is a whole number. 

**5. Conclusion:**

* The given information is inconsistent. It's impossible to have 160 pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents with the given information. 


**Final Answer:**  The provided information is inconsistent and cannot be solved.

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Rate of water loss:** Both pools lose 4 gallons per minute.
* **Initial state:** The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago.
* **Current state:** The big pool has four times the water of the small pool now.

**Setting up the Equations**

Let:

*  *x* represent the amount of water in the small pool (in gallons)
*  *y* represent the amount of water in the big pool (in gallons)

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1 (4 minutes ago):**  y - 4 = 2(x - 4)  (The big pool had twice the water of the small pool)
* **Equation 2 (now):** y + 4 = 4(x - 4)  (The big pool has four times the water of the small pool)

**Solving the Equations**

1. **Simplify the equations:**
   * Equation 1: y - 4 = 2x - 8
   * Equation 2: y + 4 = 4x - 16

2. **Solve for y in terms of x in Equation 1:**
   * y = 2x - 4

3. **Substitute this value of y into Equation 2:**
   * (2x - 4) + 4 = 4x - 16

4. **Simplify and solve for x:**
   * 2x = 4x - 16
   * -2x = -16
   * x = 8

**Answer:** The small pool has 8 gallons of water now. 
 
**Therefore, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.**

* We know the speed of the car in the slow lane (30 mph, half the speed of the fast lane).
* We know the total distance traveled by the car in the fast lane (480 miles).
* We need to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance.

**Using the Formula**

The relationship between distance, speed, and time is:

* **Distance = Speed x Time**

**Solving for Time**

1. **Find the time taken by the fast lane car:**
   * Time = Distance / Speed 
   * Time = 480 miles / 60 mph = 8 hours

2. **Find the time taken by the slow lane car:**
   * Time = Distance / Speed
   * Time = 480 miles / 30 mph = 16 hours

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.
* The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.
* The special teams have half as many players as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

**Now we can set up an equation:**

"Let's break down this problem using variables and equations:

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know:

* **c + w = 60** (The total number of animals is 60)
* **c = 2w** (He has twice as many chickens as cows)

Now we can solve for the number of animals:

1. **Substitute** the second equation into the first equation: 2w + w = 60
2. **Combine** like terms: 3w = 60
3. **Solve for w** by dividing both sides by 3: w = 20
4. **Substitute** the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 2w to find the number of chickens: c = 2 * 20 = 40

**Calculate the total number of legs:**

* Chickens have 2 legs each: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs
* Cows have 4 legs each: 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* **Total legs:** 80 legs + 80 legs = 160 legs

**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the weight of the yellow snake.
    *  Let 'y' represent the weight of the red bird.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * Pink frog = 50 pounds
    * Blue beetle = Pink frog = 50 pounds
    * Green toad = Pink frog = 50 pounds
    * Yellow snake = x pounds
    * Red bird = y pounds

* **Use the given information to create equations:**
    *  The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so: 50 = 50
    *  The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so: 50 = 50
    *  The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so: 50 = x - 10
    *  The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so: 50 = y + 20

* **Solve for the variables:**
    *  From the equation 50 = x - 10, we get x = 60 pounds.
    *  From the equation 50 = y + 20, we get y = 30 pounds.

* **Calculate the total weight:**
    *  Total weight = weight of frog + weight of beetle + weight of toad + weight of snake + weight of bird
    *  Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 280 pounds

* **Add the container weight:**
    *  Total weight = 280 + 20 = 300 pounds

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Billy's change:**

* Billy paid $10.00 and the candy cost $1.50 per pound, so he spent $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) dollars on candy, where x is the number of pounds of candy.
* We know he has $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) dollars left after buying candy.
* We also know he spent half his change on gumballs, so he spent $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) / 2 dollars on gumballs.

**2. Calculate the number of pounds of candy:**

* We know he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so he spent $40 * $0.05 = $2.00 on gumballs.
* We know he had $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) dollars left after buying candy, and he spent $2.00 on gumballs.
* We can set up an equation to solve for x: $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) = $2.00 + $0.05 * 40
* Simplifying the equation: $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) = $2.00 + $2.00
* Simplifying further: $10.00 - ($1.50 * x) = $4.00
* Solving for x: $1.50 * x = $6.00
* Dividing both sides by $1.50: x = 4 pounds

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the distance between the third city and the first city:**

* The train travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
* It travels 50 miles less than that distance, so the distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

**2. Calculate the total distance of the entire trip:**

* The total distance for one trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.
* Since the train makes 3 trips, the total distance for the day is 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles.

**3. Calculate the number of days between services:**

* The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
* The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles.
* The number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

* **The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5.**
* **The number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3(4x - 5).**

**Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50:**

x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

**Simplify and solve for x:**

x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50
17x - 20 = 50
17x = 70
x = 70/17

**Since x represents the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we need to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:**

Total people kicked out for other reasons = 50 - (people kicked out for masks) - (people kicked out for shoplifting) - (people kicked out for physical violence)

Total people kicked out for other reasons = 50 - (70/17) - (4*(70/17) - 5) - (3*(4*(70/17) - 5))

"Here's how to calculate Karan's monthly payment:

**Understanding Simple Interest**

Simple interest is calculated using the following formula:

* **I = P * r * t** 

Where:
* I = Interest
* P = Principal (the initial loan amount)
* r = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* t = Time (in years)

**Converting to Monthly Payments**

Since Karan's loan is for 5 months, we need to adjust the interest calculation to reflect monthly payments. 

1. **Calculate the annual interest:**
   * Annual interest = P * r = $3650 * 0.10 = $365

2. **Calculate the monthly interest:**
   * Monthly interest = Annual interest / 12 = $365 / 12 = $30.42 (rounded to the nearest cent)

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   * Monthly payment = Monthly interest + Principal = $30.42 + $3650 / 5 = $30.42 + $730 = $760.42

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Events:**
    * Event A: A candle does *not* explode.
    * Event B: A candle has a defect that makes it smell like wet dog.

* **Probabilities:**
    * P(A) = 0.99 (99% chance of not exploding)

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of candy bars George bought.
* Let 'y' represent the number of bags of chips George bought.

**2. Set Up the Equations:**

* We know that George spent $5.  This can be represented as: 0.40x + 0.75y = 5  (cost of chips + cost of candy bars)
* We also know that he had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money: 0.99(5) = 4.95 
* We know that he bought 3 bags of chips: y = 3

**3. Solve for x:**

* We can use the equation 0.40x + 0.75y = 5 to solve for x. 
* Substitute y = 3 into the equation: 0.40x + 0.75(3) = 5
* Simplify: 0.40x + 2.25 = 5
* Subtract 2.25 from both sides: 0.40x = 2.75
* Divide both sides by 0.40: x = 6.875

**4. Interpret the Answer:**

* Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Final Answer:** George bought **6** candy bars.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
* David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found x/2 insects.
* Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

Now we know the total number of insects is 43:
x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

To solve for x, let's simplify the equation:
x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
(5/2)x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
(5/2)x = 36

Multiply both sides by 2/5:
x = 36 * (2/5)
x = 14.4

Now that we know Bodhi found 14.4 insects, we can find David's and Lily's counts:

* David found x/2 = 14.4 / 2 = 7.2 insects
* Lily found (x/2) + 7 = 14.4/2 + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2 insects

**Therefore, Lily found 14.2 insects.**

"Here's how to solve this problem using linear programming:

**1. Define the Variables**

* Let `x` represent the number of 2x4 pieces of wood Frederick buys.
* Let `y` represent the number of 2x8 pieces of wood Frederick buys.

**2. Formulate the Objective Function**

Frederick wants to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make.  The number of sticks he can make is determined by the number of sticks per piece of wood and the number of pieces he buys.  

*  Total sticks = (2x4 sticks per piece * x pieces) + (2x8 sticks per piece * y pieces)
*  Total sticks = (2 * 4 * x) + (2 * 8 * y)

**3. Formulate the Constraints**

* **Budget Constraint:** Frederick has a budget of $24.
* **Wood Cost:** The cost of the wood is $4 per 2x4 and $6 per 2x8.
* **Non-negativity:** Frederick can't buy negative quantities of wood.

**4. Set up the Linear Programming Problem**

The objective function is to maximize the number of popsicle sticks. The constraints are:

*  4x + 6y ≤ 24  (Budget constraint)
*  x ≥ 0  (Non-negative quantity of wood)
*  y ≥ 0  (Non-negative quantity of wood)

**5. Solve the Problem**

To solve this, we can use a graphical method or a solver.  Here's a graphical approach:

* **Graph the constraints:** Plot the lines representing the budget constraint and the non-negativity constraints.
* **Find the feasible region:** The feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied.
* **Find the corner points:** Identify the corner points of the feasible region.
* **Evaluate the objective function:**  At each corner point, evaluate the objective function (total sticks) to find the maximum value.

**6. Determine the Optimal Solution**

The corner point that yields the maximum value of the objective function is the optimal solution.

**Note:**  This is a simplified explanation.  For a more detailed solution, you would need to use a solver to find the optimal values of x and y.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Define Variables:**

* Let Jame's current age be represented by 'j'
* Let his cousin's current age be represented by 'c'

**2. Set up Equations:**

* In 5 years, Jame will be 27:  j + 5 = 27

* **Let 'x' represent the cost of the printer.**

* **The computer cost $1,100, and the printer cost $400 less, so the printer cost x = 1100 - 400 = 700 dollars.**

* **The total cost of the computer, monitors, and printer is $2,400.  We can set up an equation:** 1100 + 700 + (cost of monitors) = 2400

* **We know the total cost is $2,400, and we know the cost of the computer and printer.  We can solve for the cost of the monitors:** 1100 + 700 + (cost of monitors) = 2400
* **Simplify the equation:** 1800 + (cost of monitors) = 2400

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using percentages:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
*  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, the number of red jelly beans is 'x - 0.01x = 0.99x'.
*  Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, the number of green jelly beans is 'x + 0.01x = 1.01x'.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green:  x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

**Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 2.99x = 4500
* Divide both sides by 2.99: x = 1500

**Calculate the difference in green jelly beans:**

* Green jelly beans: 1.01x = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99x = 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

**Answer:** The jar contains 1515 - 1495 = **20** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Heads:** Each sheep and goose has one head.
* **Legs:** Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs.

**Setting up the Equations**

Let:
*  's' represent the number of sheep
*  'g' represent the number of geese

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. **Equation 1 (Total Legs):** 4s + 2g = 70  (Sheep legs + Goose legs = Total legs)
2. **Equation 2 (Total Heads):** s + g = 20  (Sheep heads + Goose heads = Total heads)

**Solving for Sheep**

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using a method like substitution or elimination. Here's the substitution method:

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 't' represent the age of the twin.
* Let 'p' represent the age of the triplet.

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

*  ""One twin is 7 years older than one triplet"":  t = p + 7
*  ""Their combined ages are 44"": t + p = 44

**Solve for one of the variables:**

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
(p + 7) + p = 44

Combine like terms:
2p + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2p = 37

Divide both sides by 2:
p = 18.5

**Find the age of the twin:**

Now that we know the triplet's age (p = 18.5), we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to find the twin's age. Let's use t = p + 7:

t = 18.5 + 7
t = 25.5

**Answer:** One of the twins is 25.5 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Kangaroos:**  We know the speed of a kangaroo is constant.
* **Turtles:** The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo.
* **Time:** The time it takes to travel is directly related to the distance and speed.

**Setting up the Problem**

Let's use the following variables:

*  *k* = speed of a kangaroo (in miles per hour)
*  *t* = time it takes for the kangaroos to travel (in hours)

We can express the relationship between distance, speed, and time as:

* Distance = Speed * Time

**Solving for the Time of the Turtles**

1. **Calculate the speed of a turtle:** The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is *k/2*.

2. **Calculate the time for the turtles:**  We know the total distance is the same for both groups.  We can use the formula: 
   * Time = Distance / Speed

   Since the distance is the same, we can set up a proportion:
   * Time (kangaroos) / Time (turtles) = Distance (kangaroos) / Distance (turtles)

3. **Solve for the time of the turtles:**
   *  (18 hours) / (4 turtles) = (Distance (kangaroos)) / (Distance (turtles))
   *  (18 hours) / (4 turtles) = (k * t) / (k/2 * t)
   *  (18 hours) / (4 turtles) = (k * t) / (k/2 * t)
   *  (18 hours) / (4 turtles) = 2 * t
   *  t = (18 hours) / (8 turtles)
   *  t = 2.25 hours

**Answer:** It will take the turtles **2.25 hours** to travel across the highway.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 's' represent the number of socks Peter has.
    * Let 'j' represent the number of socks Jack has.
    * Let 'd' represent the number of dishes Jack has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  ""Peter has twice as many socks as Jack"":  s = 2j
    *  ""Half as many dishes as Jack"": d = j/2
    *  ""Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks"": d = 2s

* **Solve for 's' and 'j' using substitution:**
    * Since we know d = 2s, substitute that into the equation d = j/2:  2s = j/2
    * Solve for 's' in terms of 'j': s = j/4
    * Substitute this value of 's' into the equation d = 2s: d = 2 * (j/4) = j/2
    * We know Jack collected 60 dishes, so j = 60.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables to represent the ages:

* **Let my brother's age be ""b""**
* **Let my age be ""a""**
* **Let my sister's age be ""s""**

We can translate the given information into equations:

* **a = b - 3** (I am three years younger than my brother)
* **a = s + 2** (I am 2 years older than my sister)
* **Mom's age = 3b - 1** (My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

Now, we can use the information about the sum of our ages:

* **a + b + s = 87** 

**Let's solve for our variables:**

1. **Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:**
   (b - 3) + b + s = 87
   2b + s = 90

2. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   (b - 3) + 2 = s
   b - 1 = s

3. **Substitute the value of 'b' from the second equation into the equation from step 1:**
   2(b - 1) + s = 90
   2b - 2 + s = 90
   2b + s = 92

4. **Now we have two equations with two variables:**
   2b + s = 92
   2b + s = 90

5. **We can see that the two equations are identical. This means we have a dependent system of equations, and we can solve for 'b' and 's' using any method we choose.**

6. **Let's solve for 'b' in terms of 's' from the equation b - 1 = s:**
   b = s + 1

7. **Substitute this value of 'b' into the equation 2b + s = 92:**
   2(s + 1) + s = 92
   2s + 2 + s = 92
   3s + 2 = 92
   3s = 90
   s = 30

8. **Now that we know 's' (my sister's age), we can find 'b' (my brother's age):**
   b = s + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31

9. **Finally, we can find my age (a):**
   a = b - 3 = 31 - 3 = 28

**Therefore, you are 28 years old.**

* **Claire's badges in a year:** 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
* **Amber's badges in a year:** 1 badge/2 months * 12 months = 6 badges
* **Wendy's badges in a year:** 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Relationships:**  We know the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig and thingamabob is a proportional one.  
* **Finding the Thingamabob's Speed:** We know a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, and we know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second.  
* **Setting up the Equation:** Let 'x' represent the speed of the thingamabob.  The whatchamacallit's speed is 11 times faster than the thingamabob, so we can set up the equation: 121 = 11x
* **Solving for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 11: 121/11 = x. This gives us x = 11 meters per second.
* **Finding the Whirligig's Speed:** The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

**Answer:** A whirligig spins 55 meters per second.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
    * Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.
    * Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

* **Total earnings from mowing:**
    * Joe's lawn earnings: 6x (Joe paid $6 for the work)
    * Kamala's lawn earnings: 3x * $6 = 18x
    * Alba's lawn earnings: 5x * $6 = 30x

* **Total earnings from lemonade:**
    * Tasha's total earnings from lemonade: $80

* **Setting up the equation:**
    * Total earnings from mowing + total earnings from lemonade = $80
    * 6x + 18x + 30x + $80 = $80

* **Solving for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 54x + $80 = $80
    * Subtract $80 from both sides: 54x = 0
    * Divide both sides by 54: x = 0

* **Calculating earnings from lemonade:**
    * Since x = 0, Tasha didn't mow Joe's lawn at all. 
    * Tasha made $80 from lemonade sales.


**Final answer:** $80

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let **D** represent the number of points Dinar scored.
* Let **A** represent the number of points Azibo scored.
* Let **B** represent the number of points Bahati scored.

We know the following:

* **B = A + 10** (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* **B = D + 20** (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* **A + D + B = 45** (The total points for the team)

Now we can use substitution to solve for A:

1. **Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:**
   A + D + (A + 10) = 45

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   2A + D + 10 = 45

3. **Substitute the value of B from the first equation into the simplified equation:**
   2A + D + 10 = 45
   2A + D = 35

4. **Substitute the value of B from the second equation into the simplified equation:**
   2A + D = 35
   2A + D = 35

5. **Solve for D:**
   D = 35 - 2A

6. **Substitute the value of D back into the equation A + D + B = 45:**
   A + (35 - 2A) + B = 45
   A + 35 - 2A + B = 45
   -A + B + 35 = 45
   -A + B = 10

7. **Substitute the value of B from the first equation into the equation -A + B = 10:**
   -A + (A + 10) = 10
   10 = 10

8. **Solve for A:**
   A = 0

9. **Substitute the value of A back into the equation B = A + 10:**
   B = 0 + 10
   B = 10

10. **Substitute the value of A and B into the equation B = A + 10:**
   10 = 0 + 10
   10 = 10

**Therefore, Azibo scored 0 points.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips the other two people received.

**2. Set up the Equation:**

* The total number of corn chips is represented by the sum of the chips each person gets.
* Amora and Lainey got 70 chips each, so their total is 70 + 70 = 140 chips.
* The other two people received x chips, and they received 15 more than the others, so they received x + 15 chips.
* The total number of chips is 140 + (x + 15) = 155 + x

**3. Solve for x:**

* We know that the total number of chips is shared equally by 3 people, so we can set up an equation: 155 + x = 3 * (x + 15)
* Simplify the equation: 155 + x = 3x + 45
* Subtract x from both sides: 155 = 2x + 45
* Subtract 45 from both sides: 110 = 2x
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 55

**4. Calculate the Total Number of Chips:**

* The other two people received 55 chips each, so they received a total of 55 * 2 = 110 chips.
* The total number of chips is 140 (Amora and Lainey) + 110 (other two people) = 250 chips.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables to represent the unknown quantities:

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** A + S + W = 339 (The total number of Pokemon caught)
* **Equation 2:** A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* **Equation 3:** S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Now we can solve for Stan's catch (S).  Here's how:

1. **Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:** 
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify and combine like terms:**
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute Equation 3 into the simplified equation:**
   2S + W + 5 = 339
   2S + (4W - 13) + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   2S + 4W - 8 = 339
   2S + 4W = 347
   2S = 347 - 4W
   S = (347 - 4W) / 2

5. **Substitute this value of S back into Equation 2:**
   S = (347 - 4W) / 2 = S + 5

6. **Solve for W:**
   (347 - 4W) / 2 = S + 5
   347 - 4W = 2S + 10
   337 - 4W = 2S
   337 - 4W = 2[(347 - 4W) / 2]  (Substitute the value of S from step 5)
   337 - 4W = 347 - 4W
   0 = 10 

This result is a contradiction, meaning there is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions. 

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as the given information is inconsistent.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
* Let 'y' represent the number of flights to France.

**2. Set up Equations:**

* We know the first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights:  x = (3/4) * x 
* The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany: (1 - 3/4) * x = y + (1 - 3/4) * x
* The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its trips are half the number of the first plane: 44 = (1/2) * x

**3. Solve for 'y':**

* Simplify the equation from step 2: (1/4) * x = y + (1/4) * x
* Combine like terms: (1/4) * x = y
* Since the first plane makes 'x' flights, and the other plane makes half of that, we can say: 44 = (1/2) * x
* Solve for 'x': x = 88 
* Substitute the value of 'x' back into the equation for 'y': y = (1/4) * 88 = 22

* We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, and the total age is 20.  
* Let's call Wilfred's age 'x'.  
* The average age is (3 + 4 + x + Helene's age) / 4 = 20.

**2. Use Helene's age:**

* Helene is twice as old as the average age.
* We can set up an equation: (3 + 4 + x + Helene's age) / 4 = 20
* We know Helene's age is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (20 - 3 - 4 - x) = 2 * (13 - x)

**3. Solve for x (Wilfred's age):**

* Substitute Helene's age into the equation: (3 + 4 + x + 2 * (13 - x)) / 4 = 20
* Simplify and solve for x.

Let 'x' represent the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. We can set up a proportion:

*  2 sandwiches / $3 = 4 sandwiches / $6 = x / $x 

**Solving for x**

1. **Cross-multiply:**  2 * $6 = 4 * $3
2. **Simplify:** $12 = $12
3. **Solve for x:**  x = $12

**Answer:** The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12. 


**Therefore, the final numerical answer is $12.**

"Here's how to break down the problem to find the final probability:

* **Probability of substitute teacher:** 50%
* **Probability of extension with normal teacher:** 40%
* **Probability of extension due to dog story:** 20%

To get the probability of Marcus needing to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the scenarios where he *does* have to turn it in:

1. **Substitute teacher:**  50% chance of needing to turn in homework.
2. **Normal teacher, no extension:** 50% chance of needing to turn in homework.
3. **Normal teacher, extension:** 60% chance of needing to turn in homework.

**Final Calculation:**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let 'x' represent the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.
* In the first set, he retrieved 'x + 4' balls.
* In the third set, he retrieved 'x/2' balls.
* The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Now we can solve for 'x':

1. Combine like terms: 4x/2 + 4 + x = 19
2. Simplify: 2x + 4 + x = 19
3. Combine like terms: 3x + 4 = 19

"Here's how to calculate the car's price in 2010:

**Understanding Depreciation**

Depreciation is the gradual decrease in an asset's value over time.  It's calculated using a constant rate, meaning the percentage decrease each year is the same.

**Calculation**

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of its original price: $20000 * 0.21 = $4200
* **Year 1 Price:** $20000 - $4200 = $15800
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of its price from the previous year: $15800 * 0.21 = $3318
* **Year 2 Price:** $15800 - $3318 = $12482
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of its price from the previous year: $12482 * 0.21 = $2618.02

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **T-Rex's Consumption:** The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, leaving 1/2 * original weight.
* **Velociraptors' Consumption:** The velociraptors ate half of what was left, meaning they ate 1/2 * (1/2 * original weight).
* **Allosaurus' Consumption:** The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is the remaining portion.

Let's represent the original weight of the triceratops as ""x"".

1. **T-Rex's Consumption:**  x / 2
2. **Velociraptors' Consumption:** (x / 2) / 2 = x / 4
3. **Allosaurus' Consumption:** 270 kg

We know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg, so:

x / 2 - x / 4 = 270

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(2x / 4) - (x / 4) = 270
x / 4 = 270
x = 270 * 4
x = 1080

**Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'A' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
* Let 'M' represent the number of eggs Madeline painted.
* Let 'C' represent the number of eggs Camden painted.
* Let 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  A + M = 56 (Arnold and Madeline painted a total of 56 eggs)
*  C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
*  C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

**Solve for the variables:**

1. **Substitute** the third equation into the second equation:  (S + 12) + S = 30
2. **Simplify:** 2S + 12 = 30
3. **Solve for S:** 2S = 18, so S = 9 
4. **Substitute** the value of S back into the third equation: C = 9 + 12 = 21
5. **Substitute** the value of C into the first equation: A + M = 56
6. **Substitute** the value of C into the first equation: A + M = 56
7. **Solve for A:**  We need to find the value of A.  We can use the equation A + M = 56 and the fact that A = 56 - M.  We can substitute this into the equation to get: (56 - M) + M = 56.  This simplifies to 56 = 56, which is always true.  This means that we can't determine a specific value for A.

**Answer:** We can't determine a specific number of eggs that Arnold painted.

*  We know P(Q) = 3/4 (3/4 of the babies wear purple)
*  We know P(B) = 1/3 (1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows)
*  We know P(Q and B) = 1/4 (1/4 of the babies wear both purple and a bow)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case:

*  P(Q|B) = [P(B|Q) * P(Q)] / P(B)

*  P(B) =  We need to calculate this.

**5.  Calculate P(B)**

*  We know P(Q and B) = 1/4
*  We know P(Q) = 3/4
*  We can use the formula for conditional probability: P(Q and B) = P(Q) * P(B|Q)
*  Therefore, P(B) = P(Q and B) / P(Q) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3

**6. Substitute into Bayes' Theorem**

*  P(Q|B) = (1 * 3/4) / (1/3)

**7. Simplify**

*  P(Q|B) = 9/4

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Solve the equation:**

1. Simplify the equation: x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. Combine like terms: 6x - 35 = 37
3. Add 35 to both sides: 6x = 72
4. Divide both sides by 6: x = 12 

**Find the length of the yellow rope:**

The yellow rope is x = 12 centimeters long.

**Find the length of the blue rope:**

The blue rope is x - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters long.

**Find the length of the red rope:**

The red rope is 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

**2. Calculate the volume of the jelly beans:**

* The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning 80% of the space is actually filled with jelly beans.
* The volume of jelly beans is 900 jelly beans * 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 135 cubic inches.

**3. Calculate the theoretical number of jelly beans:**

* The theoretical number of jelly beans is the volume of the jar divided by the volume of a single jelly bean.
* Theoretical number of jelly beans = 540 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 3600 jelly beans.

**4. Calculate the difference between the theoretical and actual number of jelly beans:**

* The difference is 3600 jelly beans - 900 jelly beans = 2700 jelly beans.

**5. Calculate the percentage difference:**

* The percentage difference is (2700 jelly beans / 3600 jelly beans) * 100% = 75%

**6. Calculate the distance Tim was off:**

**Understanding the Relationship**

* **Ratio:** The ratio of seasoning to meat is 2 tablespoons : 1 pound.
* **Proportion:** We can use this ratio to find the amount of seasoning needed for a different amount of meat.

**Setting up the Proportion**

Let 'x' represent the amount of seasoning Aiden needs for 80 meatballs.  We can set up a proportion:

2 tablespoons / 1 pound = x tablespoons / 80 meatballs

**Solving for x**

1. **Cross-multiply:** 2 tablespoons * 80 meatballs = 1 pound * x tablespoons
2. **Simplify:** 160 tablespoons = x tablespoons * 1 pound
3. **Isolate x:** x = 160 tablespoons / 1 pound
4. **Convert to a ratio:**  Since we want to know the amount of seasoning needed for 80 meatballs, we can express the ratio as: 160 tablespoons / 80 meatballs = 2 tablespoons / 1 pound

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.**

We know the following:

* **b = 3c - 2** (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)
* **c + b = 5** (The total number of people in the class is 5, and each person gets 2 treats)

Now we can solve for 'c' (the number of cupcakes):

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   c + (3c - 2) = 5

2. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   4c - 2 = 5
   4c = 7
   c = 7/4

3. **Since we're looking for the number of cupcakes, we need to find the number of brownies:**
   b = 3c - 2
   b = 3(7/4) - 2
   b = 21/4 - 2
   b = 13/4

4. **We can't have fractions of brownies, so we need to round to the nearest whole number.**

**Therefore, Carly made approximately 1.75 cupcakes.**
