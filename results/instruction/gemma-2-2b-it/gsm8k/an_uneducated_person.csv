"Okay, so Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats 3, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.  She bakes muffins for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.  She sells 9 eggs at the market for $2 each, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18. 

**$18**

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many bolts of white fiber we need.  

* Blue fiber: 2 bolts
* White fiber: 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

So, we need 2 bolts of blue and 1 bolt of white.  That's a total of 2 + 1 = 3 bolts. 

**3 bolts**

"Okay, so Kylar wants 16 glasses.  

First, we need to figure out how much each of the second glasses cost.  If a glass costs $5, then a second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.60 * $5 = $3. 

Now we can figure out how much 16 glasses cost.  If each glass costs $5, then 16 glasses cost 16 * $5 = $80. 

So Kylar needs to pay $80 for 16 glasses.

"Okay, so Carla had to restart the download.  Let's see...

* She was downloading at 2 GB/minute.
* She downloaded 200 GB total.
* She had to restart the download after 40% was done.

So, let's figure out how much she downloaded before the restart. 

* 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB.
* She downloaded 2 GB/minute for 80 GB.
* That means she downloaded 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Now, she has to restart the download. 

* She has to start from the beginning.
* She has to download the rest of the file.

So, the total time is 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes. 

**Answer: 100 minutes**

"Okay, so John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, then turns around.  He's going home now.  He's got to get there in 4 hours.  He's stuck in traffic for 2 hours.  Then he drives 30 mph for 30 minutes.  He's going 80 mph for the rest of the way.  

Let's figure out how far he's gone.  

* **First 3 hours:** 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles
* **Traffic:** 2 hours * 0 mph = 0 miles
* **30 minutes at 30 mph:** 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles
* **Last 4 hours at 80 mph:** 4 hours * 80 mph = 320 miles

**Total distance:** 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 320 miles = **515 miles**


**Answer:** 515

"Okay, so Eliza works 45 hours this week.  She works 40 hours at regular pay, and then 5 more hours overtime.  

First, we find out how much she makes for the regular hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

Then, we find out how much she makes for the overtime: 5 hours * 1.2 * $10/hour = $60.

So, Eliza makes $400 + $60 = $460 for the week. 

**Answer: $460**

"Okay, so the program had 60 downloads in the first month.  The second month, it got three times that, so 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.  Then it went down 30% in the third month, so we need to figure out how many downloads were left.  30% of 180 is 54, so 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.  So the program had 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads in total. 

**366**

"Okay, so the tree costs $90 to start.  It makes $1.50 per lemon, and it costs $3 to water and feed it each year.  So, we need to figure out how many lemons he makes to make more than the cost of the tree and the watering/feeding. 

Here's how to do that:

* **Calculate yearly earnings:** 7 lemons * $1.50/lemon = $10.50
* **Calculate yearly profit:** $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Now we need to figure out how many years it takes to make more than the cost of the tree.

* **Divide the cost of the tree by the yearly profit:** $90 / $7.50 = 12 years

**Answer:** 12 years

"Okay, so Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.  That's like, a third of the whole bunch.  She sold 2 more to the red house.  So, she had 5 left, and that's after selling some.  

Let's think about it like this:

* She sold some at the green house, and then some at the red house.
* She has 5 left, so she had more than 5.
* She sold 2 more at the red house.
* She sold half of what was left at the orange house.


I think she had 10 vacuum cleaners to start with.

"Okay, so Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach.  That's a lot of hours!  

First, we need to figure out how much she makes as a teacher.  She makes $20 an hour, and she works 35 hours a week.  So, she makes $20 * 35 = $700 a week.

Then, we need to figure out how much she makes as a coach. She makes $30 an hour and works 15 hours a week. So, she makes $30 * 15 = $450 a week.

Now, we need to add her earnings from both jobs together.  She makes $700 + $450 = $1150 a week.

Finally, we need to figure out how much she makes in a year. She makes $1150 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, she makes $1150 * 52 = $60,200 a year.

First, I need to figure out how much water is in the orange drink.  Two-thirds of 10 liters is 6.67 liters.  Then I need to figure out how much water is in the pineapple drink.  Three-fifths of 15 liters is 9 liters.  So I have 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink and 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.  

Now, I spill one liter of the orange drink.  So I have 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink and 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink.  

So, I have 9 + 6.67 = 15.67 liters of water.

I know the price is $19.50, and 75% of the original price is $19.50.  

Let's think about that.  If 75% of the original price is $19.50, then the original price is $19.50 / 0.75.  

The original price is $26.00.

So, she spent $12 + $15 + $6 = $33 total.  She paid $50 total, so she must have bought $50 - $33 = $17 worth of pizza.  Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so she bought $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza.

* Shorts: 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50
* Pants: 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50
* Shoes: 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00

Now, I add all that up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

Mishka spent $243.00 on all the clothing.

Darrell is 7 parts, so he is 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

Allen is 11 parts, so he is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Okay, so Gunter wants to know how many jelly beans are in the jar.  

* First friend says 80.
* Second friend says 20 more than half of 80.  Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend says 40 + 20 = 60.
* Third friend says 25% more than the first one, which is 80 * 0.25 = 20.  So the third friend says 80 + 20 = 100.

Now we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

"Okay, so Mike played for 40 minutes.  He scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  That's 4 points.  Then he played another 20 minutes and scored 25% more.  So, he scored 4 points plus 25% of 4 points.  That's 4 plus 1 point.  So, he scored 5 points.  That's 5 points.

"Okay, so Dana is fast!  She can run real fast!  

* **Running:** Dana runs four times faster than she walks, so she runs 4 times faster than 3 miles per hour.
* **Walking:** Dana walks half as fast as she runs, so she walks 3 miles per hour / 4 = 0.75 miles per hour.
* **Running Time:** Dana spends one-third of her time running, so she runs for 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours.
* **Walking Time:** Dana spends two-thirds of her time walking, so she walks for 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours.
* **Running Distance:** Dana runs for 2 hours at 4 times her walking speed, so she runs 2 hours * 4 = 8 miles.
* **Walking Distance:** Dana walks for 2 hours at 0.75 miles per hour, so she walks 2 hours * 0.75 = 1.5 miles.
* **Total Distance:** Dana travels 8 miles (running) + 1.5 miles (walking) = 9.5 miles.

"Okay, so Perg is a big dragon, and Polly's javelin is like a super-strong stick.  She can throw it far with the gemstone, but not with just any old stick.  

Here's what we know:

* Perg is 1000 feet away.
* Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
* The gemstone makes the javelin go farther.

We need to figure out how much farther the javelin goes with the gemstone.  

Let's think about it like this:

* The javelin goes 400 feet with no gemstone.
* The gemstone makes it go 3 times farther.

So, the javelin goes 400 * 3 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

Now we know the javelin can go 1200 feet.  We need to figure out how far that is from Perg.

We know Perg is 1000 feet away.  So, Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet away from Perg.

"Okay, so Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax.  He sells each candle for $2.00.  He has to pay $10.00 for the beeswax and wicks.  So, he makes $2.00 per candle and sells 20 candles.  

Here's how to figure out his profit:

* **Cost of supplies:** $10.00
* **Revenue from candles:** 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00
* **Profit:** $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00

* Begonias: 17 pots * $2.12/pot = $36.14

So, that's $32.88 + $16.83 + $36.14 = $85.85

"Okay, so the top level is 16 square feet.  The next level is half that, so it's 16 / 2 = 8 square feet.  The next level is half of that, so it's 8 / 2 = 4 square feet.  The next level is half of that, so it's 4 / 2 = 2 square feet.  The last level is half of that, so it's 2 / 2 = 1 square foot.  The average is all the levels together: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31.  So the average is 31 / 5 = 6.2 square feet.

"Okay, so the puppy needs 1 cup a day for 180 days, that's 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups.  Then, the puppy needs food for the rest of its life, which is a long time!  

But, I don't know how long the puppy will live.  Maybe it's a little dog, maybe it's a big dog.  

So, I can't tell you exactly how many bags of food Cecilia will need.

"Okay, so Christina has 16 friends, and 1/4 of them don't show up. That means she has 16 friends - (1/4 * 16 friends) = 16 friends - 4 friends = 12 friends coming to the party. 

She needs 0.75 gift bags per friend, so she needs 12 friends * 0.75 gift bags/friend = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so she'll spend 9 gift bags * $2/gift bag = $18.

"Okay, so we got 20 adults and 5 kids.  Adults eat 10 lbs each, so that's 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.  Kids eat half as much, so they eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs each.  That's 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.  So, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 lbs of potato salad.

"Okay, so Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.  If Lee runs 38 seconds, that means Gerald would take 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.  

Gerald's diet helped him run 10% faster, so he's now 1.1 times faster.

So Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 / 1.1 = 36.36 seconds.

"Okay, so we know there are 60 dogs.  And for every dog there are two cats. So, there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.  The number of rabbits is 12 less than the dogs and cats, so there are 60 + 120 - 12 = 178 rabbits.  That's a lot of pets!  

Total pets: 60 + 120 + 178 = 358

Then we have 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts.  We need to figure out how many girls there are.  

First, we find the number of girls: 200 total students - 80 boys = 120 girls.

Now, we find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts: 120 girls * (1 - 2/3) = 120 * (1/3) = 40 girls.

"Mary has 80 potted plants. 

Here's how to solve it:

* **Weekends:** He drinks a glass of water before bed, that's 1 glass.
* **Total:** 3 glasses/day * 5 days/week = 15 glasses
* **Weekend:** 1 glass/day * 2 days/week = 2 glasses

"Okay, so Julia rowed 20 feet and it took her 16 seconds.  That means she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds.  

We know she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds.  We also know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows.  

So, we can figure out how many feet she rowed in 64 seconds.  

Let's do some math:

* Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds.
* She rowed 64 seconds / 16 seconds per 20 feet = 4 times. 
* That means she rowed 4 * 20 feet = 80 feet. 
* The boat took on 80 feet / 10 feet per liter = 8 liters of water.

"Okay, so Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more pictures than Brittany's.  That means Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 pictures.

Now, Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo.  So, we need to figure out how many ducks are in Jamal's photo.

Let's think about it like this:

* Brittany's phone can hold 300 pictures.
* We know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo.

So, we can say that the number of ducks in Jamal's photo is 300 / 50 = 6.

"Okay, so Sasha has some lumber to sell.  She has ten 2x4x10 boards and five 4x4x10 boards.  

Here's how to figure out her profit:

* **2x4x10 boards:** 10 boards * $10/board = $100
* **4x4x10 boards:** 5 boards * $16/board = $80
* **Total earnings:** $100 + $80 = $180

**Profit:**  We need to know how much Sasha spent on the lumber.  

* **Total cost:** $100 + $80 = $180

**Profit:** $180 - $180 = $0

Sasha makes $0 profit.

"Okay, so we know Katy uses 7 teaspoons of sugar for every 13 cups of water.  We also know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  

Let's think about this like a puzzle. We need to find out how many cups of water she used. 

We know the ratio is 7:13, so we can use that to figure out how many cups of water she used. 

* **Step 1:**  We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* **Step 2:**  We know the ratio is 7:13.
* **Step 3:**  We can use the ratio to figure out how many cups of water she used. 

Let's use a little math. 

* **Step 4:**  We can set up a proportion.  Let's say 'x' is the number of cups of water. 
* **Step 5:**  The proportion would be: 7/13 = 120/x
* **Step 6:**  We can solve for x. 
* **Step 7:**  Cross-multiply: 7 * x = 13 * 120
* **Step 8:**  Simplify: 7x = 1560
* **Step 9:**  Divide both sides by 7: x = 222.86 cups of water.

So, Katy used 222.86 cups of water. 


**Final answer:** 222.86

"John has 6 kids.  He buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 kids, so he buys 6 * 2 = 12 pairs of shoes.  Each pair of shoes costs $60, so he pays 12 * $60 = $720.

"Okay, so we know there were 2 containers with 5 cars each, that's 2 * 5 = 10 cars. 

Then we have 30 cars total, and we know there were 10 cars already. So, we need to find out how many more cars came in. 

30 - 10 = 20 cars.

Each container has 5 cars, so we need to divide the 20 cars by 5 to find out how many containers were brought in. 

20 / 5 = 4 containers.

So the answer is 4.

"Okay, so Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.  That means Lylah's salary was 100% - 30% = 70% of Adrien's.

Four years ago, Adrien earned $40000.  Four years later, he earned 40% more than that, so he earned $40000 * 1.40 = $56000.

We need to find Lylah's salary four years ago.  Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we know that Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's.  So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $40000 * 0.70 = $28000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary was $56000.  Lylah's salary four years later was $28000 * 1.40 = $39200.

The total salary the two were receiving four years later was $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

"Miguel uses 600 sheets of paper every month. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* There are 4 weeks in a month.
* He uses 60 * 4 = 240 sheets a month.

"Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.  Then she slept 2 hours less each day for the next two days, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.  That's 6 * 2 = 12 hours total for those two days.  Then she slept 1 hour more than that, so she slept 12 + 1 = 13 hours for the rest of the week.  So, she slept 13 + 8 + 12 = 33 hours in total.

"Okay, so I gotta figure out how much each watermelon costs.  Watermelons are three times more expensive than peppers, so I need to figure out how much a pepper costs.  Each pepper costs 15 dollars.  

Watermelons are three times more expensive than peppers, so each watermelon costs 15 dollars * 3 = 45 dollars.

Oranges cost 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so each orange costs 45 dollars - 5 dollars = 40 dollars.

Now I need to figure out how much it costs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. 

* Watermelons: 4 watermelons * 45 dollars/watermelon = 180 dollars
* Peppers: 20 peppers * 15 dollars/pepper = 300 dollars
* Oranges: 10 oranges * 40 dollars/orange = 400 dollars

So, the total cost is 180 dollars + 300 dollars + 400 dollars = 880 dollars.

"Okay, so we got 500 people coming in a day, and each one takes 24 minutes.  That's a lot of people!  

The doctors get $150 an hour, and the hospital charges the patients $200.  So, we need to figure out how much money they make from each visit.

First, we need to figure out how much time the doctors spend on each patient.  That's 24 minutes.  

Then, we need to figure out how much money the hospital makes from each patient.  That's $200.

Now, we can figure out how much money the hospital makes from all the patients.  That's 500 patients times $200 per patient.  That's $100,000.

So, the hospital makes $100,000 from these visits.

* Chips: 2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00
* Cookies: 2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, let's add up all the food: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Then, we gotta add the delivery fee: $20.00 + (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

I had 8 hours to do the first test.  I did 8 hours * 5 questions an hour = 40 questions.

I had 6 hours to do the second test.  I did 6 hours * 5 questions an hour = 30 questions.

"Okay, so we know there are 700 bees in the hive.  

Let's think about it:

* **Baby bees:**  There are twice as many baby bees as queens.  
* **Queens:**  We don't know how many queens there are, but we know there are twice as many baby bees as queens.

So, we need to figure out how many queens there are. 

Let's say there are 'x' queens.  Then there are 2x baby bees.

Now, we know there are 700 bees in total.  So, we can write an equation:

700 = x + 2x + 2x

Let's solve for x:

700 = 5x
x = 140

So, there are 140 queens.

Now we can figure out how many worker bees there are:

* **Worker bees:** There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
* **Baby bees:** We know there are 2x baby bees, so there are 2 * 140 = 280 baby bees.
* **Worker bees:** There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so there are 2 * 280 = 560 worker bees.

So, there are 560 worker bees.

* **Clients:** He has 3 clients now, and wants to add 5 more. That's 3 + 5 = 8 clients.
* **Bleach:** Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, and he's selling them for $2 each. So, he'll need 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles of bleach.
* **Cloth:** Each client needs 1 pack of cloths, and he's selling them for $5 each. So, he'll need 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs of cloths.
* **Total Income:** He's making $92 per week.
* **Total Expenses:** He needs 16 bottles of bleach * $2/bottle = $32 for bleach. He needs 8 packs of cloths * $5/pack = $40 for cloths.
* **Profit:** His total income is $92 and his total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72. So, his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, and he bikes 440 feet per minute.  That's a lot of feet!  Tim is only 2 miles away, and he skates 264 feet per minute.  

Let's see... 

* Steve's distance is 3 miles, so he'll travel 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet.
* Tim's distance is 2 miles, so he'll travel 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet.

Steve takes 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes to get home.
Tim takes 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 39 minutes to get home.

Steve is 36 minutes - 39 minutes = -3 minutes behind Tim.  Tim is the winner! 

**Answer:** Tim will be waiting 3 minutes.

"Okay, so Shawnda is charging 25 cents per tire.  

* People on bikes: 5 people * 2 tires/person = 10 tires
* People on tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires/person = 9 tires
* People on unicycles: 1 person * 1 tire/person = 1 tire

Total tires: 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires

Shawnda made 20 tires * $0.25/tire = $5.00

**Answer:** $5.00

"Okay, so the seagull ate half of Dave's fries, then the pigeons ate some, and then the raccoon took some more.  Let's figure it out!

* Seagull ate half:  Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate half, so there were 14 / 2 = 7 fries left.
* Pigeons ate some:  The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* Raccoon took some: The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, so there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left.
* Ants took one: The ants took one fry, leaving 5 fries.

This doesn't make sense!  We can't have negative fries!

"Okay, so Kimo has classes every day, but only on certain days.  He has 3 classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 2 classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  That's a lot of classes!  

Let's figure out how many hours he spends in class.

* **Monday, Wednesday, Friday:** 3 classes * 1 hour/class = 3 hours
* **Tuesday, Thursday:** 2 classes * 2 hours/class = 4 hours
* **Total:** 3 hours/day * 3 days/week + 4 hours/day * 2 days/week = 9 hours/week + 8 hours/week = 17 hours/week

Now, we need to figure out how many weeks there are in a semester.  There are 16 weeks in a semester.

* **Total hours:** 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

So, Kimo spends 272 hours in class in a semester.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how long all the rolls, croissants, and baguettes are together. 

* **Rolls:** 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* **Croissants:** 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* **Baguettes:** 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now we add all that up: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches.

To get that in feet, we divide by 12: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

**Answer:** 280 feet

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many bananas the apes need in total. 

* Monkeys: 200 bananas
* Gorillas: 400 bananas
* Baboons: 100 bananas

Now we need to figure out how many bananas he needs to order for two months. 

* He needs 700 bananas every month.
* He needs to order for 2 months.

So, he needs to order 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Blake runs 1500 yards and Kelly runs 1360 yards. 

Blake runs 1500 yards - 1360 yards = 140 yards farther than Kelly.

* The paper cost $20.
* So, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

"Okay, so Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses, and 2 more clownfish. 

Let's figure out how many fish they caught. 

* **Starfish:** Anakin had 10, Locsin had 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
* **Sea Horses:** Anakin had 6, Locsin had 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
* **Clownfish:** Anakin had 3, Locsin had 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

So, Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

"Okay, so the price goes up 20% every two months.  That's like a little bit of a math problem.  

First, we need to figure out how much the price goes up each month.  20% of 20 dollars is 4 dollars.

So, the price goes up 4 dollars every two months.

Now, we need to figure out how much the price will be after 36 months.  We can do that by adding the price increase to the original price.

So, the price will be 20 dollars + 4 dollars * 18 = 20 dollars + 72 dollars = 92 dollars.

* Computer: €1090

"Seth is 14 years old. 

Here's how I figured that out:

* **Let's use variables:** Let Seth's current age be ""S"" and Brooke's current age be ""B"".
* **Set up equations:** We know:
    * S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
    * S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 (In two years, their ages will be 28)
* **Solve for S:**
    * Substitute S = 2B into the second equation: 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28
    * Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28
    * Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24
    * Divide both sides by 3: B = 8
* **Find S:**  Since S = 2B, then S = 2 * 8 = 16

"Okay, so the hat is $25.  The jacket is three times the hat, so it's $25 * 3 = $75.  The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so it's ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.  So, the total cost of the uniform is $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Okay, so we got spiders with 8 legs each, insects with 6 legs each, and some weird mutant bugs with 10 legs each.  

* Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs
* Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs
* Mutant bugs: 3 bugs * 10 legs/bug = 30 legs

So, all together, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

"Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Thirtytwo, so Granny Red is 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.  Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old. The total age of the four birds is 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 41 years.

"Okay, so we know they made $25 in profit.  They sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass is $0.50.  That means they made $20 * $0.50 = $10.00 from selling the glasses.  They spent $3.00 per gallon on lemons and $2.00 on sugar.  So, they spent $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 on lemons and sugar.  They made $25.00 in profit, so they spent $5.00 on lemons and sugar.

"Okay, so the winner got 3/4 of the votes, and that's like, a big chunk!  So, we need to figure out how many votes the loser got. 

Here's how:

* **Think of it like sharing:** If the winner got 3/4, that means the loser got 1/4.
* **Multiply to find the answer:**  If the total votes were 80, and the winner got 3/4, we can find the loser's votes by doing 80 * (1/4) = 20.

So, the loser got 20 votes.

"Okay, so Sandra needs red roses.  She got 200 pink calla lilies, and those are five times the number of white carnations.  So, she got 200 pink calla lilies, and that means she got 200 / 5 = 40 white carnations.  She got four times as many red roses as white carnations, so she got 4 * 40 = 160 red roses.

"Okay, so Jerry's die has six sides.  

*  The numbers on the die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
*  There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6).
*  There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6).

So, the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row is 3/6 * 2/6 = 1/6.

The probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 * 1 = 1/2.

The difference is 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3.

That's 33.33%.

We can't have a fraction of a rat, so we need to figure out how many rats there are.

"Okay, so Mandy owes Benedict $100 and he gives her 2% interest every month.  So, she pays him $100 + (2% of $100) = $100 + $2.  That's $102.

"Okay, so the trader bought the wheat for $20 a bag and it cost $2 to get it to the warehouse.  He made $400 profit after selling the wheat for $30 a bag.  

Here's how to figure out how many bags he sold:

* **Calculate the total cost:**  He spent $2 * number of bags = $2 * x 
* **Calculate the total revenue:** He made $30 * number of bags = $30 * y
* **Set up the equation:**  We know the total revenue minus the total cost equals the profit. So, $30 * y - $2 * x = $400

We need to find the value of 'x' (the number of bags). 

**Here's the problem:** I can't figure out the number of bags because I don't know how many bags he bought.

"Okay, so we know they spent $20.25 on tickets.  They spent $4.50 less on food, so they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.  Then they spent $33 x 2 = $66 on rides.  So, all together they spent $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.00.  They split the cost evenly, so each person paid $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

"John collects 18 peaches. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Minutes:** John works for 3 hours, which is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.
* **Peaches per minute:** He collects 2 peaches per minute.
* **Total peaches:** He collects 180 * 2 = 180 peaches.

"Okay, so we know ducks need 3.5 pounds of bugs a week.  That's a lot of bugs!  

If there are ten ducks, that means each duck needs 3.5 pounds / 10 ducks = 0.35 pounds of bugs per duck.

Now, we need to figure out how many pounds of bugs they need per day.  There are 7 days in a week, so we do 0.35 pounds per duck * 7 days = 2.45 pounds of bugs per duck per day.

So, the answer is 2.45 pounds.

"Okay, so Tom plants 10 trees a year, and chops down 2.  That means he's planting more than he's chopping down.  He starts with 50 trees.  So, after 10 years, he's got 50 + 10 * 10 = 150 trees.  But 30% of those trees die, so he's left with 150 - (150 * 0.3) = 150 - 45 = 105 trees.

* **Sunday:** They added 18 more pink flamingos.

"Okay, so we have 200 pounds of carrots and 40 restaurants.  Each restaurant gets 2 pounds.  So we do the math: 200 pounds / 40 restaurants = 5 pounds per restaurant.  We have 200 pounds and each restaurant gets 2 pounds, so we have 200 - (40 * 2) = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds left over.

"Okay, so Elaine started with 20 cards.  She got 3 times that many in the first month, so she had 20 * 3 = 60 cards. 

Then she got 20 fewer than that in the second month, so she had 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she got twice the number from the first and second months, so she had 60 + 40 = 100 cards.

So, in total, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 100 = 220 cards.

"Okay, so Carl ate cheese on sandwiches every day for lunch.  He ate 2 slices on each sandwich.  He ate cheese and egg omelets 3 days a week.  He used 1 more slice per omelet than on the sandwiches.  He used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.  

So, he ate 2 slices a day for lunch, and he ate 3 days a week.  That's 2 * 3 = 6 slices of cheese.  He ate 1 more slice per omelet than on the sandwiches, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet.  He ate 3 slices of cheese per omelet for 3 days, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese.  He used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.  So, he used 6 + 9 = 15 slices of cheese.

"Okay, so Brinley wants to get an average of 93.  Mr. Bert takes the lowest score and throws it out.  

Here's how to figure out what Brinley needs to get on the sixth test:

* **Find the total score Brinley needs:** 93 is the average, and she has 5 tests. So, she needs 93 * 6 = 558 total points.
* **Find the sum of her current scores:** 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448
* **Subtract the lowest score:** 448 - 89 = 359
* **Find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test:** 359 + 93 = 452

**Answer:** Brinley needs a score of 452 on the sixth test.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much a cup costs.  

First, we know half a dozen plates cost $6000 * 6 = $36000. 

Then, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that, so they cost $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Now, we need to figure out how much one cup costs.  

We have 24 cups in a dozen, so we can divide the total cost by 24: $34800 / 24 = $1450.

So, each cup costs $1450.

So, she makes $5 * 4 = $20 babysitting and $4 * 4 = $16 mowing the lawn.  She can make $20 + $16 = $36.  She needs to make $70 - $36 = $34 more.  She can make $34 / $4 = 8.5 times mowing the lawn.  She needs to mow the lawn 9 times to have enough money.

"Lori needs to work $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.  She makes $8.00 an hour, so she needs to work $352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours.

"Okay, so Janeth borrowed $2000 and wants to pay back $165 a month for 12 months.  That's a lot of money!  

So, she's gonna pay back $165 a month for 12 months, that's $165 * 12 = $2040.  

She's gonna pay back $2040, and she borrowed $2000, so she's gonna pay back $2040 - $2000 = $40. 

So, her remaining balance will be $40. 


**Answer: $40**

"Okay, so we have 4 roses.  Dahlias are more, 7 more than the roses.  So, we have 4 + 7 = 11 flowers in the vase.

"Okay, so Harriet is 21 years old. Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old. Zack is half of Harriet's age, so Zack is 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old. 

In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old. Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old. Zack will be 10.5 + 3 = 13.5 years old.

Now, to find the average age, we add up their ages and divide by three. That's (24 + 66 + 13.5) / 3 = 103.5 / 3 = 34.5.

**34.5** 
"
"Okay, so Naomi got 68 points.  Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so he scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.  To find out how many points Jojo scored, we just have to take the total points and subtract Naomi's, Yuri's, and Brianna's points.  That's 251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 104 points. 

**104**

"Okay, so Carmen did crossword puzzles for 3 puzzles * 10 minutes per puzzle = 30 minutes.

"Okay, so the company spent $15000 on ads the first year.  Then they spend a third of that, which is $15000 / 3 = $5000.  So, they spend $15000 + $5000 = $20000 in total.

"Okay, so Carlos rents a canoe for 3 hours, that's $30 * 3 = $90.  Benji rents a banana boat raft for 5 hours, that's $18 * 5 = $90.  So, together they pay $90 + $90 = $180. 

**$180**

"Okay, so the bus trip is 6 days.  Car trip is half that, so it's 6 / 2 = 3 days.

"Okay, so James has 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water.  He loses 8 water, and gets 14 more grass.  So he has 32 water left.

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type, we need to know how many water types there are compared to all the cards. 

* Water types: 32
* Total types: 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

The percentage is (32 / 90) * 100% = 35.56%

So the answer is 36.

"Okay, so Chad wants a burrito.  He gets the base burrito for $6.50.  He adds meat for $2.00, cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces for $0.25 each, so that's $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + (2 x $0.25) = $6.25.  He wants to upgrade his burrito for $3.00, so that's $6.25 + $3.00 = $9.25.  He has a $5.00 gift card, so he only has to pay $9.25 - $5.00 = $4.25.

"Okay, so Kalinda puts 4 pieces a minute. Her mom puts half as many, so she puts 4 / 2 = 2 pieces a minute.  

To find out how long it takes them to finish, we need to know how many pieces they put together each minute.  

We need to know how many pieces they put together in an hour.  

Let's figure that out. 

* Kalinda puts 4 pieces a minute.
* Her mom puts 2 pieces a minute.
* In an hour, Kalinda puts 4 * 60 = 240 pieces.
* In an hour, her mom puts 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.
* Together, they put 240 + 120 = 360 pieces in an hour.

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"Okay, so here's what we know:

* **First harvest:** Ashlyn took 30% of 120 watermelons, which is 30/100 * 120 = 36 watermelons.
* **After the first harvest:** She had 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.
* **Second harvest:** 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, so she took 3/4 * 84 = 63 watermelons.
* **Watermelons left:**  She had 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons left.

**Answer:** 21 
"
"Okay, so Mark buys 12 cars, and each car is $20,000.  He pays 10% tax on the cars, so he pays 10% of 12 cars times $20,000 each, which is $2,400.  Then he pays $1,000 for registration on each car, so he pays $1,000 times 12 cars, which is $12,000.  So, he pays $2,400 for the cars plus $12,000 for registration, which is $14,400. 

**14,400**

"Okay, so Robert has 20 shells. Kylie has 5 more than Robert, so she has 20 + 5 = 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more than Monday, so she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many penguins are swimming and how many are eating.  

* One-third of the penguins jump in the water, so that's 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.
* Another one-third go inside the cave, so that's 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.
* That means 12 + 12 = 24 penguins are swimming or eating.
* So, we start with 36 penguins and take away 24, leaving 36 - 24 = 12 penguins still sunbathing. 


**12** 
"
"Okay, so Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day.  His girlfriend eats half as much, so she eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes a day.  He eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so he eats 6 * 2 = 12 tomatoes a day.  He wants to grow enough tomatoes to eat 12 tomatoes a day.  A vine can grow 3 tomatoes a week, so he needs 12 / 3 = 4 vines.

He writes a page every 6 minutes, so he writes 30 / 6 = 5 pages a day.  He writes 5 pages a day, and there are 7 days in a week, so he writes 5 * 7 = 35 pages a week.  He writes 35 pages a week.

"Okay, so we have two aquariums.  

* Snail one has 4 snails.
* Snail two has 32 snails.

The difference between the snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. 

We need to figure out how many fish are in each aquarium. 

Let's think about it like this:

* Snail two has 32 snails.
* Snail one has 4 snails.
* The difference is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
* The difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. 

So, we need to figure out how many fish are in each aquarium. 

Let's say there are 'x' fish in each aquarium. 

We know that the difference in snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. 

So, 28 = 2 * x. 

Solving for x, we get x = 14. 

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The movie is 5 weeks long, so she works 24 * 5 = 120 hours total.

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, so she charges Jean 250 * 0.90 = $225 for the work.

So, Jean paid $225.

We know there are 3 classes, and each has 20 students.  So there are 3 * 20 = 60 students in the school.  We also know half the school is boys and half is girls.  So there are 60 / 2 = 30 boys and 30 girls.  

We know the first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls.  So there are 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls in the third class.

"Okay, so the redwood is 200 feet tall.  And each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.  So, we need to figure out how much wood is in the whole tree.  

First, we need to figure out how many 10-foot sections the redwood has.  That's 200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections.

Now, we need to figure out how much wood the termites ate.  They ate 30% of the wood, so we need to multiply the weight of the wood by 30%.  That's 400 pounds * 0.30 = 120 pounds.

Now we need to figure out how much wood is left.  We need to subtract the weight the termites ate from the total weight of the wood.  That's 400 pounds - 120 pounds = 280 pounds.

So, the redwood weighs 280 pounds.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

36 cookies / 12 cookies per cup of flour = 3 cups of flour. 

We need to figure out how many cups of flour are needed for 30 cookies tomorrow. 

We know that 2 cups of flour make 12 cookies. 

So, we need to divide 30 cookies by 12 cookies per cup of flour.

"Okay, so I got 50 newspaper ads and 15 TV ads.  Newspaper ads cost $5 each, and TV ads cost $75 each.  So, I gotta add up the cost of all the newspaper ads and all the TV ads. 

Newspaper ads cost 50 * 5 = $250.
TV ads cost 15 * 75 = $1125.

So, I spent $250 + $1125 = $1375 on all the ads.

"Okay, so Mary got 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300. The second bag has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms. So, Mary got 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

"Okay, so John has 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each.  That's 6 windows in each house.  Then there are 4 more windows in each house that aren't in the bedrooms.  So, that's 8 windows in total.  Then you add up the windows in the bedrooms and the extra windows.  That's 6 + 8 = 14 windows.

"Okay, so the mom buys cocoa, laundry, and pasta.  That's $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00.  She pays $20.  So, she gets $20 - $15.00 = $5.00 back.

"Okay, so the body is 900 stitches.  The collar is a tenth of that, so it's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.  The rosette is twice the size of the collar, so it's 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.  The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so the sleeves are 1800 - 90 - 180 = 1500 stitches.  

So each sleeve takes 1500 / 2 = 750 stitches.

"Okay, so Mrs. Rylan has a lot of seeds!  Tomato seeds cost $40 each and celery seeds cost $30 each.  She has 20 tomato seeds and 80 celery seeds.  To find out how much she spent, we need to add up the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds.  

20 tomato seeds * $40/seed = $800
80 celery seeds * $30/seed = $2400

So, she spent $800 + $2400 = $3200 on seeds.

"Okay, so Sean has a song with 54 lines.  The first scene has twice the lines of the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines.  But only a third of those lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines.  The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.  And four-fifths of those lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.  So, Sean has to memorize 36 + 48 = 84 lines.

"Okay, so Carly had 80 cards.  Two-fifths of them had A, so that's 80 * (2/5) = 32 cards.  

Now, she has 80 - 32 = 48 cards left.  Half of those had B, so that's 48 / 2 = 24 cards.

That leaves 48 - 24 = 24 cards.  Five-eighths of the rest had C, so that's 24 * (5/8) = 15 cards.

So, the rest of the cards, the ones that didn't have A or B or C, had D.  That's 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

"Okay, so I gotta dig 30 small holes and 15 big holes.  

Small holes take 3 minutes each, so 30 small holes will take 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.

Big holes take 10 minutes each, so 15 big holes will take 15 * 10 = 150 minutes.

So, all together it will take 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.

Now, we gotta convert that to hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

"Ruby is older than Sam, so she is 6 times older.  Ruby is 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years.  So, in 9 years, Sam will be 3 times as old as Ruby.  We can solve this problem by setting up an equation. Let's say Sam is currently x years old.  Then Ruby is 6x years old.  In 9 years, Sam will be x+9 years old and Ruby will be 6x+9 years old.  We know that in 9 years, Sam will be 3 times as old as Ruby, so we can write the equation: x+9 = 3(6x+9).  Solving for x, we get: x+9 = 18x + 27.  Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 9 = 17x + 27.  Subtracting 27 from both sides, we get: -18 = 17x.  Dividing both sides by 17, we get: x = -18/17.  Since we can't have a negative age, this means there is no solution.  This means there is no way for Ruby to be 6 times older than Sam and for Ruby to be 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years.

To find out how long it took the slow lane car to travel 480 miles, we need to figure out how long it took the fast lane car to travel 480 miles.

We know the fast lane car is going 60 miles per hour.  So, to travel 480 miles, it took 480 miles / 60 miles per hour = 8 hours.

So the answer is 390.

"Okay, so Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. That's 3 hours. 

She works 3 hours, and she makes $5 every 10 minutes.  

First, we need to figure out how many minutes she works. 3 hours is 180 minutes.

Then, we divide the total minutes by 10: 180 minutes / 10 minutes per dollar = 18 dollars.

So Susan earns 18 dollars.

"Okay, so Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 = 42 points. 

In the fourth round, everyone gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, Mike gets 21 + 1 = 22 points. Jim gets 18 + 1 = 19 points. Tony gets 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: 21 + 18 + 42 + 22 + 19 + 43 = 155 points.

"Okay, so Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day.  On the second day, he did 100 + 20 = 120 pushups, 50 - 10 = 40 squats, and 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.  So, he did 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses in two days.

"Okay, so 5 people eat rice at lunch and dinner, that's 5 people * 2 meals = 10 people eating rice.  

That means they eat 10 people * 0.2 kg/person = 2 kg of rice per day.

A 42 kg bag will last 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

"Okay, so here's how we figure this out:

* Carmen bids after the other people.
* The bids go up $50 each time.
* We need to figure out how many times the bids go up.

Let's start with the first bid: $200. 

* The next bid is $250.
* The next bid is $300.
* The next bid is $350.
* The next bid is $400.
* The next bid is $450.
* The next bid is $500.

So, Carmen wins the desk for $500.

"Okay, so John drives 30 miles to work each way, 5 days a week, for 50 weeks a year.  That's a lot of driving!

First, we need to figure out how many miles he drives each week.  He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 miles a day.

Then, we need to figure out how many miles he drives in a year.  He drives 60 miles a day * 5 days a week * 50 weeks a year = 15,000 miles a year.

Now, we need to figure out how much he pays for gas.  He pays $2 per mile, so he pays 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 a year.

And, he gives his driver a $150 bonus each month.  That's $150 * 12 months = $1,800 a year.

So, he pays $30,000 for gas and $1,800 for the driver.  That's a lot of money!

**Answer: $31,800**

"Okay, so on Sunday he did 23 minutes and on Monday he did 16 minutes.  So, that's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.  He wants to do twice that, so he has to do 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

"Okay, so the bakery makes 60 loaves.  Two-thirds of those are sold in the morning, so that's 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves.  

Then they have 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.  Half of those are sold in the afternoon and evening, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

"Okay, so the ice cream is cheaper now, and the milk is cheaper too.  I need to figure out how much I save on the ice cream and the milk. 

Ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2 saved on ice cream.

Milk: $0.5 off each packet, so 4 packets is $0.5 * 4 = $2 saved on milk.

Total savings: $2 + $2 = $4.

**Answer:** $4

"Okay, so Helena's serum makes you grow an arm every three days and a leg every five days.  

Here's how to figure out how many limbs you'll have after 15 days:

* **Arms:** 15 days / 3 days per arm = 5 arms
* **Legs:** 15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 legs

So, you'll have 5 arms and 3 legs.

**Total: 5 + 3 = 8 limbs**

"Okay, so Theo wants to go to South Africa and he's got $6000.  He buys suits, suitcases, and a plane ticket.  

Here's how we can figure out how much he has left for gifts:

* **Suits:** 6 suits * $100/suit = $600
* **Suitcases:** 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150
* **Plane ticket:** 5 * $100 = $500
* **Plane ticket cost:** $700 more than $500, so it's $500 + $700 = $1200
* **Total spent:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350
* **Money left:** $6000 - $2350 = $3650
* **Gifts:** $3650 - $2000 = $1650

So, Theo has to spend $1650 on gifts. 


**Answer:** $1650

"Okay, so three people eat three eggs each day, that's nine eggs.  The other two people eat two eggs each, that's four eggs.  So, that's nine plus four, that's 13 eggs a day.  In a week, that's 13 eggs a day times seven days, that's 91 eggs.

"Quinn is 30, so Jane is 27. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 32.

"Okay, so Cera is 46 years old.  Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.  

Six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age, so he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000 people.

Now, the population of Chile is 60,000 + 6 = 60,060 people. 

**60,060**

"Okay, so we know the team has 105 players.  The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so the defense has 105 / 2 = 52.5 players.  But we can't have half a player, so we need to figure out how many players are on the defense.  The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, so they have 52.5 / 2 = 26.25 players.  This doesn't make sense, so we need to check our math.  


**Answer:**  We can't have half a player. 
"
"Okay, so Martha has 2 families with 6 people each, that's 2 * 6 = 12 people.  And she has 3 families with 4 people each, that's 3 * 4 = 12 people.  So, she has 12 + 12 = 24 people.  But 8 people couldn't come, so now she has 24 - 8 = 16 people.  And 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 people.  So, 16 - 2 = 14 people show up. 

**14**

"Okay, so Solomon got 20 marbles from Johanna.  That's a start!  Then his dad gave him 2/5 times that many, which is like 2/5 * 20 = 8 more marbles.  So now Solomon has 20 + 8 = 28 marbles.  And each marble weighs 2 kgs, so the total weight is 28 * 2 = 56 kgs.

"Okay, so the pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.  That's a big pool!  

To figure out how much it costs to fill, we need to find the volume of the pool.  

Volume is like how much space the water takes up.  We can find it by multiplying the length, width, and height:

6 feet * 4 feet * 5 feet = 120 cubic feet

Now we know the pool needs 120 cubic feet of water.  

The cost is $.1 per cubic foot, so we just multiply the volume by the cost:

120 cubic feet * $.1 per cubic foot = $12.00

So it costs $12.00 to fill the pool. 


**$12.00** 
"
"Okay, so we know there are 30 boys.  Girls are 3 times the number of boys, so there are 30 * 3 = 90 girls.  Now, we know there are 1/10 as many nongendered kids as boys, so there are 30 / 10 = 3 nongendered kids.  That's a total of 90 + 30 + 3 = 123 kids in the classroom.

"Okay, so we know the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3.  That means for every 1 pole, we need 3 wires.  We also know we need 45 wires.  So, let's think about it like this:

* If we have 45 wires, and we need 3 wires for every pole, we can figure out how many poles we need by dividing the total wires by 3.

45 wires / 3 wires per pole = 15 poles

**Answer: 15** 
"
"Okay, so we start with 25 men and 15 women, that's 40 people total.  Then 1/4 of the people leave, so that's 40 / 4 = 10 people.  So now we have 40 - 10 = 30 people left.  But we also know 22 men stayed, so we need to figure out how many women are left.

"Jam has 26 pencils.  Meg has 46 pencils.  We need to know how many pencils Jam has in her boxes.  We know Jam has 26 pencils total.  We also know she has 2 loose pencils.  So, we need to know how many pencils Jam has in her boxes.  We can figure that out by subtracting the loose pencils from the total number of pencils.  26 - 2 = 24.  We need to know how many boxes Jam has.  We know Jam has 24 pencils.  We can figure that out by dividing the number of pencils by the number of pencils per box.  24 / 2 = 12.  So, Jam needs 12 boxes.  Meg needs 46 pencils.  We can figure that out by dividing the number of pencils by the number of pencils per box.  46 / 2 = 23.  So, Meg needs 23 boxes.  We need to know how many boxes Jam and Meg need.  We can figure that out by adding the number of boxes Jam needs and the number of boxes Meg needs.  12 + 23 = 35.  So, Jam and Meg need 35 boxes.

"Okay, so the ice makes the coffee weaker, and it gets colder.  I need to know how much weaker it gets for each degree of cooling.  

Here's what we know:

* Ice makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker for every 13 degrees it cools.
* We need to know how much weaker it gets when it's cooled 65 degrees.

So, we can figure that out by doing some math.

"Okay, so we know:

* Senior programmers make $2000 + $400 = $2400 a month.

Let's figure out how many junior programmers there are:

* 100 people * (2/5) = 40 junior programmers

Now we can calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers:

* 40 junior programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000

And the total amount paid to senior programmers:

* 40 senior programmers * $2400/programmer = $96,000

Finally, the total amount paid to all programmers:

* $80,000 + $96,000 = $176,000

Let's think about it like this:

He buys twice as many on the way home as he gave to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.  He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, so he has 22 + 28 + 3 + 2 = 55 lollipops.

"Okay, so the phone is at 60% charged.  That means it needs to get to 100%.  

The phone charges 1% every 3 minutes.  So, we need to figure out how many 3-minute intervals it takes to get to 100%.

60% is like 60/100, which is 0.6.  So, we need to figure out how many 3-minute intervals it takes to get to 1.

We can do that by dividing 1 (the full charge) by 0.6 (the percentage we need to reach). 

1 / 0.6 = 1.6666666666666667.

That means it will take 1.6666666666666667 hours to fully charge.

"Okay, so Farmer Brown has chickens and cows.  He has twice as many chickens as cows.  Let's think about it.  

* **Let's say he has 'c' cows.**
* **He has twice as many chickens as cows, so he has 2*c chickens.**

Now, we know he has 60 animals total.  So, we can write an equation:

c + 2c = 60

Let's solve for 'c':

3c = 60
c = 20

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows.

Now we can find the number of chickens:

2 * 20 = 40 chickens

**Total animals:** 20 cows + 40 chickens = 60 animals

**Total legs:** 20 cows * 4 legs/cow + 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 + 80 = 160 legs

The total weight of the container is 20 pounds.  So the total weight of the animals is 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 40 pounds + 70 pounds = 220 pounds.

* **Total:**  We add up all the times: 1 hour + 3 hours + 0.5 hours + 2 hours = 6.5 hours.

**Answer:** 6.5 hours

"Okay, so John did boating, swimming, and watching shows.  He spent 6 hours boating, and half that time swimming, so he spent 6/2 = 3 hours swimming.  He watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long, so he watched 3 * 2 = 6 hours.  That's 6 hours boating + 3 hours swimming + 6 hours watching = 15 hours.  That's 15 hours total.  He spent 30% of his time watching shows, so he spent 15 hours * 0.30 = 4.5 hours watching shows.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 15 hours * 0.40 = 6 hours sightseeing.

"Okay, so Annabelle works two jobs.  First, she works 20 hours at $10 an hour, so she makes 20 * 10 = $200.  Then she works 15 hours at $5 an hour, so she makes 15 * 5 = $75.  That's a total of $200 + $75 = $275.  She already has $80 saved, so she needs $400 - $275 = $125 more.

"Okay, so the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than that, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.  The tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so it's 6 + 11 = 17 feet tall.

"Okay, so Dean got 6 cars and 5 teddy bears.  That's a lot of toys!  

* Cars cost $2 each, so 6 cars cost $2 * 6 = $12.
* Teddy bears cost $1 each, so 5 teddy bears cost $1 * 5 = $5.
* So, Dean spent $12 + $5 = $17.
* His mom gave him $10 more, so he has $17 + $10 = $27.

Dean has $27 left.

"Okay, so Morgan wants to do mini-golf, arcade, and go-karts.  

Here's how we can figure out how many friends she can invite:

* **Mini-golf:** $5 per round, and she has $90 total.  So, she can do 90 / 5 = 18 rounds of mini-golf.
* **Arcade:** She has $5 for tokens.
* **Go-karts:**  She wants to go twice, and each ride costs $10.

Now, let's add up the costs:

* **Mini-golf:** 18 rounds * $5/round = $90
* **Arcade:** $5
* **Go-karts:** 2 rides * $10/ride = $20

That's a total of $90 + $5 + $20 = $115.

Morgan has $90 for her party.  She can invite 115 / 90 = 1.22 friends.  

She can invite **1** friend.

"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles to the second city, 100 miles to the third city, and then 50 miles less than that to go back to the first city.  That's 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.  

The train goes 125 miles to the first city from the third city.  

So, the train goes 125 miles to the first city from the third city.  

The train goes 3 times a day.  

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  

So, the train goes 18,000 miles / 3 = 6,000 miles per service. 

The train goes 125 miles to the first city from the third city.  

The train goes 6,000 miles / 125 miles = 48 services. 

The train goes 48 services.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much stuffing a collie bed needs.  

First, we find the average of 8 and 2.  Halfway between 8 and 2 is 5.  So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, we need to figure out how much stuffing we need for the chihuahua beds.  We need 2 pounds of stuffing for each chihuahua bed.  We need to make 4 chihuahua beds, so we need 2 * 4 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

Finally, we need to figure out how much stuffing we need for the collie beds.  We need 5 pounds of stuffing for each collie bed, and we need to make 3 collie beds, so we need 5 * 3 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

So, we need a total of 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

"Okay, so John drives 200 miles to his friend's house.  He goes 70 mph.  Then he takes a detour, so he goes 10 miles further.  That's 200 + 10 = 210 miles.  Then he goes home, and he goes 80 mph.  That's 240 miles.  So, how long did it take him to get there?

* **Step 1:**  He drives 210 miles at 70 mph, so it takes him 210 / 70 = 3 hours.
* **Step 2:** He drives 240 miles at 80 mph, so it takes him 240 / 80 = 3 hours.
* **Step 3:**  He drives 3 hours to get to his friend's house and 3 hours to get home.  That's 3 + 3 = 6 hours.

* 4 times that many (3 * 4 = 12) were kicked out for shoplifting.
* 3 times the number of shoplifters (12 * 3 = 36) were kicked out for physical violence.

So, we have a total of 3 + 12 + 36 = 51 people kicked out.

To find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we can subtract the number of people kicked out for masks, shoplifting, and violence from the total: 50 - 51 = -1.

"Okay, so we got 44 seniors.  Each one needs a picture frame, and that costs $20.  Then we gotta add 20% to the frame, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra.  So each frame costs $20 + $4 = $24.  We got 44 seniors, so that's $24 * 44 = $1056.  Then we got 2 seniors getting pins, and each pin is $5, so that's $5 * 2 = $10.  Then we got 1/4 of the seniors are officers, and they need cords, and each cord is $12, so that's $12 * 1/4 = $3.  So the total cost is $1056 + $10 + $3 = $1079.

"Okay, so the company bought $400,000 worth of equipment.  And 40% of that was bad.  So, we need to figure out how much of the money was good.  

First, we need to figure out how much of the equipment was bad.  40% of $400,000 is $160,000.

Now we need to figure out how much of the money was good.  We can do that by subtracting the amount of bad equipment from the total amount of equipment.  So, $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

So the answer is $240,000.

"Okay, so Karan borrowed money, and it's got interest.  She pays it back in equal amounts.  So, we need to figure out how much she pays back each month. 

We know the total amount borrowed is $3,650 and the interest rate is 10%.  We can use a simple math trick to figure this out. 

First, we need to figure out how much interest she'll pay in five months.  We can do that by multiplying the total amount borrowed by the interest rate, and then dividing that by the number of months.

* Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 = $365
* Monthly interest = $365 / 5 = $73

So, Karan has to pay $73 each month.

"Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to make a bow for each gift.  She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers.  That's a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.  She can use 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all of her gifts.  So, she can use 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches of ribbon per gift.

"Okay, so Betty and Sam have popsicles in a ratio of 5 to 6.  That means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

We know they have 165 popsicles total.  

Let's figure out how many popsicles each person has:

* **Betty's popsicles:**  We can find this by thinking about the ratio. If the ratio is 5:6, and they have 165 popsicles total, we can figure out how many popsicles are in each part of the ratio. 
* **Sam's popsicles:**  We can do the same thing for Sam.

Let's use a little math to find out how many popsicles each person has. 

* **Betty's popsicles:** 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part
* **Sam's popsicles:** 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part

Now we can figure out how many popsicles Sam has more than Betty. 

* **Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles:** 15 popsicles - 15 popsicles = 0 popsicles

**Answer:** Sam has 0 more popsicles than Betty.

"Okay, so Tim's cable is $60 a month.  He gets Netflix for $10.  Hulu and Disney Plus are $10 each, but he gets a deal for bundling, so he saves 20% off.  So, Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 * 0.20 = $2 off each.  That's $2 * 2 = $4 off.  So, Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $4 = $6 each.  Tim saves $60 - $10 = $50.  


**Answer: $50**

"Okay, so Carol writes a song for 4 hours.  Then she records it for half that time, which is 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours.  She then edits it for 90 minutes.  

So, she spends 4 hours + 2 hours + 90 minutes = 6 hours and 30 minutes total.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100%.

(90 minutes / 6 hours and 30 minutes) * 100% = 15%

**15%** 
"
"Okay, so Wendy wants to put 20 more than double the number of books in a shelf.  

Let's think about it:

* Double the number of books in 6 rows and 6 columns is 6 * 6 = 36 books.
* 20 more than that is 36 + 20 = 56 books.

So Wendy needs 56 books.

"Okay, so the AC uses 900 watts per hour.  If he uses it for 8 hours a day, that's 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts per day. 

If he uses it for 3 hours less, that's 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day.  

So, he uses 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watts per day.

He saves 7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts per day.

To get kilowatts, we divide by 1000: 4500 watts / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatts.

"Okay, so Joanne got 30 apples from the tallest trees.  Her sister got twice as many from the tallest trees, so she got 30 * 2 = 60 apples.  

Joanne got half as many apples from the shortest trees as her sister, so her sister got 60 / 2 = 30 apples.

"Okay, so we know camels have two humps and dromedaries have one.  We have to figure out how many of each there are.  

We know the total heads are 180.  Let's say there are 'c' camels and 'd' dromedaries.  That means:

* c + d = 180 

We also know the total bumps are 304.  Camels have two bumps each, and dromedaries have one. So:

* 2c + d = 304

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.  Let's try to solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries).

We can do this by rearranging the first equation:

* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:

* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

So, there are **56** dromedaries.

So he traveled 240 kilometers in the next two days.  Then he didn't travel on the next day.  So he traveled 300 kilometers a day for the rest of the trip, and that's 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.  So he traveled a total of 800 + 240 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"Okay, so four boats came and took some cats off the rock.  Then some cats ran after a mouse.  I think I know how to solve this!

First, the boats took away 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats. 

Then, there were 50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats left.

And then 3/5 of the cats ran off.  That's 30 cats * (3/5) = 18 cats.

So, there are 30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats left on the rock.

"Okay, so Bill got a deal for 6 months at $8, then it went to $12 for the next 8 months.  That's 14 months total.  Then it went to $14 a month.  So, for 2 years, he's paying for 24 months.  

* 6 months at $8 = $48
* 8 months at $12 = $96
* 8 months at $14 = $112
* 24 months total = $48 + $96 + $112 = $256

"Okay, so we got buses, minibusses, and minivans.  We need to add up how many people they can hold. 

* Buses: 4 buses * 60 people/bus = 240 people
* Minibuses: 6 minibusses * 30 people/minibus = 180 people
* Minivans: 10 minivans * 15 people/minivan = 150 people

Now we add all that up: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people

So, 570 people can go on the trip.

"Okay, so Lillian has 6 bird feeders now.  She has 3 she made herself and 3 she bought.  Each of the homemade feeders has 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.  So, she has 20 birds on each of her homemade feeders and 20 birds on each of the store-bought feeders.  That's 20 + 10 = 30 birds on the homemade feeders.  So, she has 30 birds on the homemade feeders and 20 birds on the store-bought feeders.  That's a total of 30 + 20 = 50 birds.

"Okay, so Kenny wants to go to the amusement park and he has $50.  He's selling his Pokemon cards for $1.50 each.  He wants to make enough money to buy the ticket.  

Here's how we can figure out how many cards he has:

* **Money needed:** $100
* **Money he has:** $50
* **Money he needs to make:** $100 - $50 = $50
* **Price per card:** $1.50
* **Number of cards to sell:** $50 / $1.50 = 33.33

So, Kenny needs to sell 33 cards to make enough money to go to the amusement park.

"Okay, so Charlotte wants pots and pans, bowls, and some utensils.  She wants to spend $120.00.  The bowls are $20.00, and the utensils are $5.00 each, so she needs 5 of them.  That's $5.00 x 5 = $25.00.  So, the total cost of the pots and pans is $120.00 - $20.00 - $25.00 = $75.00.  The clerk said everything was 20% off, so she gets $75.00 x 0.20 = $15.00 off.  So, her total cost is $75.00 - $15.00 = $60.00.

"Okay, so Antoine wants to make a big pot of soup!  He needs twice the onions, so he'll need 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.  He's making soup for 6 people, so he'll need 4 pounds / 6 people = 0.67 pounds of onions per person.  

The onions are $2.00 a pound, so he'll spend 0.67 pounds * $2.00/pound = $1.34 on onions.

The beef stock is $2.00 a box, and he needs 2 boxes, so that'll cost him 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

So, the total cost is $1.34 + $4.00 = $5.34.

The cost per serving is $5.34 / 6 people = $0.89 per person.

"Okay, so Billie's room is 3 yards long.  A yard is like a big foot, right?  So, we need to figure out the width.  

We know the area is 360 square feet.  We can use the formula for area:  Area = length * width.

Let's say the width is 'w'.  So, 360 = 3 * w.

Now, we can solve for 'w': 
360 / 3 = w
120 = w

So, the width is 120 feet.

Now, we can find the perimeter:  Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).  

Perimeter = 2 * (3 + 120) = 2 * 123 = 246 feet.

"Okay, so Elizabeth got 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. That's 1 * 20 = 20 red beads and 2 * 20 = 40 clear beads. 

Margareth got 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. That's 3 * 20 = 60 blue beads and 4 * 20 = 80 red beads.

So, Elizabeth has 20 red + 40 clear = 60 beads. 

Margareth has 60 blue + 80 red = 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Okay, so Marcus is baking in the oven for 3 hours, and the oven is on for 3 hours, so it's gonna get hotter.  The oven is on for 3 hours, and it gets hotter by 5 degrees per hour, so it gets 3 * 5 = 15 degrees hotter.  Then Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so it cools down 30 / 10 = 3 degrees.  So the final temperature is 40 + 15 - 3 = 52 degrees.

"Okay, so Jon is fast!  He swims fast, bikes fast, and runs fast.  

* Jon's swim is 40 minutes.
* Jon's bike is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.
* Jon's run is 50 minutes.
* Jon wins by 10 minutes.

James is faster than Jon in the swim, but slower on the bike.  We need to figure out how long James takes to run. 


Let's think about it this way:

* Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.
* James is 10 minutes faster in the swim, so he's 40 minutes * 1.10 = 44 minutes.
* James is 5 minutes longer on the bike, so he's 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.
* James's total time is 44 + 85 + x = 139 minutes. 
* We know that James's total time is 139 minutes and Jon's total time is 170 minutes. 
* We know that Jon won by 10 minutes. 
* We can solve for x. 
* 139 - 170 = -31 minutes.

"Okay, so the horse runs for 30 minutes, that's like 0.5 hours.  

First, we need to figure out how many miles the horse runs.  

* 32 MPH is like 32 miles per hour.
* 0.5 hours is 0.5 * 32 = 16 miles.

Now, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile.

* The horse runs 16 miles, so it eats 16 / 2 = 8 bails of hay.

Now we need to figure out how much the hay costs.

* Each bail costs $3.
* The horse eats 8 bails, so it costs 8 * $3 = $24.

Now we need to figure out how much money Michael has left.

* Michael has 6 $5 bills, so he has 6 * $5 = $30.
* He spends $24 on hay, so he has $30 - $24 = $6 left.

You know the super ticket is $20 and you get a popcorn and soda for $1 extra.  That means the popcorn and soda cost $1.  You saved $2, so you paid $12 for the ticket and got a popcorn and soda for $1.  So the popcorn and soda cost $1.  

The soda costs $3.  So the popcorn costs $1. 


**$1** 
"
"Okay, so the balloons cost $900 for 20 balloons.  That means each balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.  

Then they raised the price by $20, so now each balloon costs $45 + $20 = $65.

To fill 170 balloons, it would cost $65 * 170 = $11050. 


**11050**

"Okay, so the car goes fast for a little bit, then slow for a little bit.  

First, we need to figure out how far the car goes when it's going 60 mph.  That's like, 60 miles in two hours.  Then, when it goes 30 mph for an hour, that's like, 30 miles.

So, the car goes 60 miles + 30 miles = 90 miles.

Now, we need to figure out how long the whole trip is.  It's two hours plus one hour, which is three hours.

The average speed is how far you go divided by how long it takes.  So, the average speed is 90 miles / 3 hours = 30 mph.

"Jenna has 8 sapphires and trades them for 2 rubies.  She has 8 sapphires and 2 rubies.  Sapphires are worth $800 and rubies are worth $1200.  So, she has 8 sapphires worth $800 and 2 rubies worth $1200.  That's $800 + $1200 = $2000. 

**$2000**

"Okay, so Bob has 10 beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.  That's a lot of space!  Each bed needs 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet of soil.  He needs 10 beds * 32 cubic feet/bed = 320 cubic feet of soil.  Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he needs 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags of soil.  That'll cost him 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920. 

**$1920** 
"
"Okay, so we got 15 red cards.  That's a start!  Green cards are 60% more than red, so we need to figure out how many more.  60% of 15 is like 15 times 0.6, which is 9.  So, we add 9 to the red cards, making 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.  Now, yellow cards are the same as the sum of red and green, so we add them together.  That's 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.  So, we have 15 red, 24 green, and 39 yellow cards.  That's a total of 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

"Okay, so Katelyn saw 50 fairies.  Half of that is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies.  Then 25 more fairies came from the east.  So there are 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.  Then 30 fairies flew away.  So there are 75 - 30 = 45 fairies left. 

**45** 
"
"Okay, so Jennifer has 8 puppies and 3 have spots. Brandon has 12 puppies and 4 have spots.  We need to find the total number of puppies with spots. That's 3 + 4 = 7 puppies.  Then we need to find the total number of puppies. That's 8 + 12 = 20 puppies.  So, 7 puppies have spots, and there are 20 puppies total.  That's 7/20 = 0.35.  That's 35%.


**35%** 
"
"Okay, so the farmer needs to get all this feed for his horses.  He's got a lot of stuff!

* Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds
* Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weight: 3150 + 1300 + 2 + 48 = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. So, the farmer needs to make 4500 / 2250 = **2 trips** to get all the feed.

"Okay, so Grayson drinks cans and bottles.  

* Aluminum cans are worth two cents each.
* Plastic bottles are worth three cents each.
* She drinks 3 cans of soda and 5 bottles of water.

So, Grayson earns 2 cents * 3 cans = 6 cents from the cans.
And she earns 3 cents * 5 bottles = 15 cents from the bottles.

That's 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents for the cans and bottles.

Now, we need to figure out how much she earns in four weeks.

* Grayson earns 21 cents per week.
* She recycles for four weeks.

So, Grayson earns 21 cents * 4 weeks = 84 cents in four weeks.


**84 cents** 
"
"Okay, so Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, which is 10 plants * 0.60 = 6 more plants. Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.

"Okay, so each room has two sheets, one comforter, and twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.  And twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 towels.  So, each room has 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.  Now we just multiply that by 80 rooms, so 15 * 80 = 1200 pieces of laundry. 

**1200** 
"
"Okay, so Frank starts with 200 shoes. He gets 5 more on Monday, 15 more on Wednesday, and 30 more on Friday.  That's 5 + 15 + 30 = 50 more shoes.  Then he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.  So, he has 200 + 50 - 180 = 70 shoes left.

"
"Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar makes 8 cupcakes.  So she can make 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.  She needs to bake enough cupcakes to use all of her sprinkles, so she needs to bake 48 / 12 = 4 pans.

"
"Okay, so the pen cost $2.  Three times the price of the pen is $2 * 3 = $6.  One dollar less than that is $6 - $1 = $5.  So the paper cost $5.  She paid $10, so she got $10 - $5 - $2 = $3 in change.

"
"Okay, so we have 30 students and each starts with 10 pencils.  That's 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

Now, after two months, 1/5 of the pencils are used. That's 300 * (1/5) = 60 pencils gone.

So, there are 300 - 60 = 240 pencils left.

Then, at the end of the year, only 1/3 of the pencils are left. That's 240 * (1/3) = 80 pencils.

So the answer is 80.

So, we need to add them up.  10 feet is 120 inches.  6 inches is 6 inches.  So, the remoras are 6 inches.  The remoras are 6 inches long.  The shark is 120 inches long.  So, the remoras are 6/120 of the shark's length.  That's 6/120 times 100%.  That's 5%.

"Okay, so if 20 students don't have a computer, that means the rest of the students do.  

If 3/4 of the students have computers, that means 1/4 don't.

So, if 20 don't have computers, we can figure out how many there are by thinking about the whole group.

"Okay, so we know 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both.  That's a lot of allergies! 

Let's see... if we just add those up, we get 9 + 6 + 3 = 18 kids with allergies.  

Now, we need to find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything.  We know there are 32 kids in total, and we already counted the ones with allergies.  So, we just do 32 - 18 = 14 kids who aren't allergic.

**14** 
"
"Okay, so we got 3 groups of 200 people each, and each group has 7 tour guides.  So we got 3 groups * 200 people/group = 600 people.  And each group has 7 tour guides, so we got 600 people * 7 guides = 4200 people. 

**4200** 
"
"Okay, so the hotel is 20% more than $1500 a day, so it's $1500 * 1.20 = $1800 a day.  

The total cost for the hotel is $1800 * 3 days = $5400.

The plane tickets are $5000 each, so the total cost for the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

The total cost of the trip is $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

**Answer: 15400**

"Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so he has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint. Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.  So, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"Okay, so the 1959 penny is 48 grains.  The 2010 penny is three-quarters of that, so it's 48 * (3/4) = 36 grains.  So, the 1959 penny is 48 grains and the 2010 penny is 36 grains.  Together they weigh 48 + 36 = 84 grains.

"Okay, so Keegan and Tashay need $200. Keegan has $83 and Tashay has $91.  They need to make $200 - $83 - $91 = $26 more.

"Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so he has 3 * 20 = 60 songs. Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs to his player. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs to his player. Luri can add 40 - 60 = -20 fewer songs than Gabriel.

"Okay, so Stetson ate 2/5 of 60 oranges.  That's like, two-fifths of 60, right?  So, 2/5 * 60 = 24 oranges.  He gave up 10 dollars for each orange, so he gave up 24 * 10 = 240 dollars. 

**240**

"Okay, so shoes cost $80.  Three times that is $80 * 3 = $240.  Then, Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than that, so it cost $240 - $20 = $220.

"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week.  So he runs 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles a week.  He runs 10 miles an hour, so he runs 60 miles / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours a week.

"Okay, so Uncle Ben has four horses, and each horse eats five pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day.  That means each horse eats 10 pounds of oats a day.  

Over five days, that's 10 pounds a day * 5 days = 50 pounds of oats.

He needs 50 pounds of oats / 50 pounds per bag = 1 bag of oats.

"Okay, so Jana has 27 puppies and two-thirds are Pomeranians.  That's like, a lot of puppies!  So, we gotta figure out how many are girls.  One-third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we just gotta find out how many of the Pomeranians are girls.  

*Think about it like this: if you have 27 puppies and two-thirds are Pomeranians, that's like 27 / 3 = 9 Pomeranians.

"Okay, so I need to figure out how much each razor costs.  

* **Buy one get one free:**  That means if I buy 2 packs, I get 4 razors for the price of 2.
* **Coupon:**  I get $2.00 off.

So, I need to figure out the price of 2 razors after the sale. 

* **Sale price:**  $4.00 for 2 razors.
* **Coupon:**  $2.00 off.

**Final answer:** 2 packs of razors cost $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00. 

Each razor costs $2.00 / 2 razors = $1.00. 

**Each razor costs 100 cents.**

"Okay, so we got 4 girls on the bottom, and then 3 on top of them, and then 2 on top of the 3.  The shortest girl is at the top.  So, we need to add up the heights of all the girls.  

* 4 girls at the bottom are 64 inches each.
* 3 girls on top of the 4 are 60 inches each.
* 2 girls on top of the 3 are 60 inches each.

So, the total height of the pyramid is 4 * 64 + 3 * 60 + 2 * 60 = 256 + 180 + 120 = 556 inches.

Now we need to convert that to feet.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so 556 inches is equal to 556 / 12 = 46.33 feet.


**Answer:** 46.33 feet

"Okay, so Charisma works 8 hours a day.  That's 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.  She walks 5 minutes every hour, so she walks 480 minutes * 5 minutes/hour = 2400 minutes.  Over 5 days, she walks 2400 minutes * 5 days = 12000 minutes.

"Okay, so Paul drives twice a day, morning and afternoon.  He does that for 14 days.  That's a lot of driving!

* Morning rides cost $6 each.
* Afternoon rides cost $2 each.

So, he drives twice a day, morning and afternoon, for 14 days.  That's a lot of driving!

* Morning rides cost $6 each.
* Afternoon rides cost $2 each.

Let's add up the cost of the morning rides: $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the cost of the afternoon rides: $2 * 2 = $4.

Now, let's add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides: $12 + $4 = $16.

So, Paul spent $16 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"Okay, so Mark wants to know how many people he needs to invite to make the two venues the same price.  

Let's think about it:

* **Venue 1:**  He pays $200 no matter how many people come.
* **Venue 2:** He pays $25 per person.

To figure out when they're the same price, we need to figure out how many people he needs to invite to make the cost of Venue 2 equal to Venue 1.

Let's use some math:

* **Venue 1:** $200
* **Venue 2:** $25 per person * number of people

We need to find the number of people that make the two prices the same. 

Let's set up an equation:

$200 = $25 * number of people

Now we can solve for the number of people:

$200 / $25 = number of people
8 = number of people

**Answer:** Mark needs to invite 8 people for the two venues to be the same price.

"Okay, so David found half of what Bodhi found.  Let's think about that.  Bodhi found the most, so David found half of that.  Lily found 7 more than David.  Let's figure out how many insects Bodhi found.  

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.  So, we need to figure out how many insects Bodhi found. 

Let's say Bodhi found 'x' insects. David found half of that, which is x/2.  Lily found 7 more than David, so she found x/2 + 7.

We know that the total number of insects is 43.  So, we can set up an equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Let's solve for x:

3x/2 + 7 = 43

3x/2 = 36

3x = 72

x = 24

So, Bodhi found 24 insects.

David found half of that, which is 24/2 = 12 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

**Answer: 19**

"Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, and Mariah used 1/4 of a skein.  So, we need to add those together. 

1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4

3/4 * 364 yards/skein = 273 yards

They used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Okay, so Cherrie has 5 friends that want 5 gifts each, that's 5 * 5 = 25 gifts.  Then she has 3 friends that want 2 gifts each, that's 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.  So she has 25 + 6 = 31 gifts.  And then she gets 10 more, so she has 31 + 10 = 41 gifts.

"Okay, so the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, which is 3 feet.  So the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide. 

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, which is 8 feet. So the couch is 2 * 8 + 2 = 18 feet long. 

The couch is 18 feet long.

"Okay, so Suzie bought four packs of gum. Two were strawberry, and she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.  She also bought a green apple gum pack for half the price of the grape gum.  So, she spent $2 for grape gum and $1 for the green apple gum.  That's $3 total.  She spent $7 total, so she spent $7 - $3 = $4 on the strawberry gum.  So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $4 / 2 = $2. 


**$2**

"Okay, so the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.  

Let's figure that out:

* The zoo has 20 sheep.
* The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
* The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.
* The farm has 30 cows.
* The farm and zoo have a total of 30 + 60 = 90 animals.

"Okay, so Ada uses 12 kilowatts a day.  She's adding a new device that uses 2 kilowatts a day.  That's a total of 14 kilowatts a day.

Now, we need to figure out how much that costs her.  She uses 14 kilowatts a day, and each kilowatt costs $1.50.  So, that's 14 kilowatts * $1.50 per kilowatt = $21.00 a day.

Now, let's figure out how much that is per week.  There are 7 days in a week, so that's $21.00 a day * 7 days = $147.00 a week.

Before she adds the new device, her weekly bill was $147.00.  After she adds the new device, her weekly bill is $147.00 + $21.00 = $168.00.

The difference is $168.00 - $147.00 = $21.00.

So, in 8 years, his cousin will be 2 * 27 - 5 = 49 years old.

The question asks how many years separate the ages of the two now.  So, we need to find the difference between their ages now.  Jame is 27 now, and his cousin is 49 in 8 years.  So, the difference is 49 - 27 = 22 years.

"Okay, so Verna bought apples, oranges, and peaches.  Apples cost $1.50 each, oranges cost $0.80 each, and peaches cost $0.75 each.  She bought three apples, five oranges, and six peaches.  That's a lot of fruit!  

Let's see how much that cost:

* Apples: 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
* Oranges: 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
* Peaches: 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Total cost: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20.  So, she got: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

"Okay, so Ali calls 3 families, and each family calls 3 more.  That's like a chain reaction!  So, we gotta keep going.  

Here's how it works:

* **Round 1:** Ali calls 3 families.
* **Round 2:** Each of those 3 families calls 3 more families. That's 3 * 3 = 9 new families.
* **Round 3:** Each of those 9 families calls 3 more families. That's 9 * 3 = 27 new families.
* **Round 4:** Each of those 27 families calls 3 more families. That's 27 * 3 = 81 new families.

So, in the fourth round, 81 families will be notified.

"Okay, so I need to figure out how much all the stuff costs first. 

* Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
* Pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
* Calculator: 1 calculator * $12/calculator = $12.00
* Geometry set: 1 set * $10/set = $10.00

Now, I need to add all those up: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

And then I need to take off the discount.  

10% of $20.00 is $2.00.

So, the final price is $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

Let's break it down:

* Cold water time: 16 minutes
* Twice the cold water time: 16 minutes * 2 = 32 minutes
* Warm water time: 32 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes

Now, we need to figure out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.

* Cold day time: 16 minutes
* Warm day time: 34 minutes
* Difference: 34 minutes - 16 minutes = 18 minutes

"Okay, so we have 21 buttons.  Seven buttons have two holes, and the rest have four holes.  So, we need to figure out how many buttons have four holes.  

We can do that by taking the total number of buttons and subtracting the number of buttons with two holes. 

21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons

Now we need to figure out how many holes are on those 14 buttons.

14 buttons * 4 holes per button = 56 holes

So, there are 56 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

Then we gotta figure out how much the carpet costs.  It's $12 per square foot, so that's 12 times 216 = $2592.

Finally, we gotta figure out how much the contractor charges.  He charges $4 per square foot, so that's 4 times 216 = $864.

He gets 180 contacts / 0.5 days per contact = 360 days of contacts.

He gets 360 days / 10% off = 360 / 0.10 = 3600 days of contacts.

"Okay, so we know the jar has red and blue jelly beans, and we know there are more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.  

Let's think about it like this:

* **Let's say there are 'x' jelly beans of blue jelly beans.** 

* **Then there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so there are 'x - 0.01x' red jelly beans.**

* **And there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so there are 'x + 0.01x' green jelly beans.**

Now we know the total is 4500 jelly beans.  So:

* **x + (x - 0.01x) + (x + 0.01x) = 4500**

**Let's solve for x:**

* **3x + 0.02x = 4500**
* **3.02x = 4500**
* **x = 1489.5**

So, there are 1489.5 blue jelly beans.

**Now we can find the difference between green and red jelly beans:**

* **Green jelly beans - Red jelly beans = (x + 0.01x) - (x - 0.01x)**
* **Green jelly beans - Red jelly beans = (1489.5 + 0.01 * 1489.5) - (1489.5 - 0.01 * 1489.5)**
* **Green jelly beans - Red jelly beans = 1489.5 + 1.49 - 1489.5 + 1.49**
* **Green jelly beans - Red jelly beans = 1.49**

"Okay, so George needs $2000 for each implant, and he wants one with a crown, so that's $2000 + $500 = $2500.  He's already paid $600, so he needs to pay $2500 - $600 = $1900 more.  He makes $15 an hour, so he needs to work $1900 / $15 = 126.67 hours.

"Okay, so we know the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's say the smallest angle is ""x"".  The bigger angle is twice the smallest, so it's 2x.  The other angle is three times the smallest, so it's 3x.  Now we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.  That means 6x = 180.  So, x = 30.  The smallest angle is 30 degrees.  The bigger angle is 2 times 30, which is 60 degrees.  The largest angle is 3 times 30, which is 90 degrees.  So the answer is 90.

He saves up money to buy 1 game a month for a year, so he buys 12 games in total.

Then, the next year he buys 2 games a month, so he buys 12 * 2 = 24 games.

The third year he buys 4 games a month, so he buys 12 * 4 = 48 games.

So, in total, he has 10 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 94 games.

"Okay, so Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.  That's like 400 miles / 2 miles per rotation = 200 rotations a month.  

Now, we know each tire can do 10,440,000 rotations.  So, we need to figure out how many months it takes to do that many rotations.

200 rotations a month * 12 months a year = 2400 rotations a year.

We know each tire can do 10,440,000 rotations.  So, we need to divide 10,440,000 by 2400 rotations a year.

10,440,000 / 2400 = 43.5 years.

So, it will take Jeremy's tires about 43.5 years to need to be replaced.

"Okay, so we know the jumbo bottle lasts 120 washes and you use 1 pump per wash.  So, you need to figure out how many washes you get from 1 pump.  

Here's how:

* You have 120 washes and you use 1 pump per wash.
* You use 1 pump for 120 washes.
* So, 1 pump is good for 120 washes.

Now, we know that the jumbo bottle costs $24.00.  We can figure out how much each pump costs by dividing the total cost by the number of pumps.

* $24.00 / 120 washes = $0.20 per wash.
* $0.20 per wash / 1 pump = $0.20 / 1 pump.

So, each pump costs $0.20.  

To convert that to cents, we multiply by 100.

* $0.20 * 100 cents = 20 cents.

**Answer:** 20 cents

"Okay, so Joe wants to buy a shirt for $25 and some shorts for $35.  The shirt is 30% off, so he gets a good deal!  

First, we need to figure out how much the shirt costs after the discount.  30% of $25 is $7.50.  So the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Now, we need to add the price of the shorts.  The shorts cost $35.

So, the total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Now we need to add the sales tax.  We don't know the sales tax rate, but let's say it's 5%.  That means the total cost is $52.50 + (5/100) * $52.50 = $52.50 + $2.63 = $55.13.

Joe will have $50 - $55.13 = -$5.13 left.  

**Final answer: -$5.13**

"Okay, so John got $100,000 for the first 5 months.  Then, he got more money each month after that.  He got 50% more money each month after the first 5 months.  So, how much did he spend? 

Let's break it down:

* **First 5 months:** $100,000
* **Months 6-10:**  He got 50% more each month, so he got $100,000 * 1.50 = $150,000 for the next 5 months.
* **Total cost:** $100,000 + ($150,000 * 5) = $100,000 + $750,000 = $850,000

"Okay, so the truck is $30,000, and the king cab is $7,500.  Leather seats are one-third the price of the king cab, so they are $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.  Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they are $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.  The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.  So, the total cost is $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $44,500.

"Okay, so Tim gets a raise of 5% of his $20,000 a month. That's like 5% of 20,000, which is 1000.  Then he gets a bonus of half his salary, which is 20,000 / 2 = 10,000.  So, his total salary is 20,000 + 10,000 = 30,000.  He makes 30,000 a year.

"Okay, so James got 10 suits and 10 dress pants.  Suits cost $750 each, and pants cost half that, so they cost $750 / 2 = $375 each.  He got 3 dress shirts with each suit, so he got 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts.  That's 30 shirts * $60 = $1800.  The total cost is $750 * 10 + $375 * 10 + $1800 = $7500 + $3750 + $1800 = $12050.

"Okay, so Bill can dig 4 feet per hour in soil, and half that in clay, so he digs 2 feet per hour in clay. 

First, we need to figure out how long it will take him to dig the soil. 

* He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
* He digs 4 feet per hour.
* So, it will take him 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours to dig the soil.

Now, let's figure out how long it will take him to dig the clay.

* He digs 2 feet per hour in clay.
* He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
* So, it will take him 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours to dig the clay.

Finally, we add the time for the soil and the clay.

* 6 hours (soil) + 4 hours (clay) = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"Okay, so Ariadne sold half the amount of green hats as red hats.  That means the green hats sold were $400 / 2 = $200.

Now, the second month, she sold 3/4 of the first month's sales. So, she sold $400 * (3/4) = $300 in the second month.

To find the total sales for two months, we add the sales from both months: $400 + $300 = $700.

"Okay, so the plane cost $150,000.  He pays $5000 a month for the hanger.  He spends twice that much on fuel, so he spends $5000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel a month.  So, he spends $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 a month on the plane.  That's $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000 a year.  So, the plane cost him $150,000 and he spent $180,000 in the first year.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out the cost of the first mix and then the cost of the second mix. 

First, we gotta figure out the cost of the first mix. 

* A pound of almonds costs $10.
* A pound of walnuts costs $15.

So, the cost of the first mix is:

* 1/2 pound of almonds * $10/pound = $5
* 1/3 pound of walnuts * $15/pound = $5

So, the cost of the first mix is $5 + $5 = $10.

Now, we gotta figure out the cost of the second mix.

* 1/5 pound of almonds * $10/pound = $2
* 1/3 pound of walnuts * $15/pound = $5

So, the cost of the second mix is $2 + $5 = $7.

The difference in cost is $7 - $10 = -$3. 

So, the answer is **-3**.

"Okay, so we know the total legs are 70 and the total heads are 20.  

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2.  We can use that to figure out how many of each animal there are. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Let 's' be the number of sheep.**
* **Let 'g' be the number of geese.**

We know:

* **s + g = 20** (total heads)
* **4s + 2g = 70** (total legs)

Now we can solve for 's'.  We can use substitution.  Let's solve the first equation for 's':

* **s = 20 - g**

Now we can plug that into the second equation:

* **4(20 - g) + 2g = 70**

Simplify and solve for 'g':

* **80 - 4g + 2g = 70**
* **80 - 2g = 70**
* **-2g = -10**
* **g = 5**

Now that we know 'g' (the number of geese), we can find 's':

* **s = 20 - g**
* **s = 20 - 5**
* **s = 15**

So, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Okay, so we have two groups of people: twins and triplets.  One twin is older than one triplet.  We know the total age is 44.  

Let's think about this:

* **Let's say the triplet is X years old.**
* **The twin is X + 7 years old.**

Now we can write an equation:

* **X + (X + 7) = 44**

Let's solve for X:

* **2X + 7 = 44**
* **2X = 37**
* **X = 18.5**

So, the triplet is 18.5 years old.

Now we can find the twin's age:

* **Twin = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5**

So, the twin is 25.5 years old.

"John has 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history.  That's 80 minutes of homework.  He has 180 minutes before dinner.  He can nap for 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

"Okay, so Manolo got five lollipops and four candies.  That's a lot of sweets!  

* Lollipops cost $0.40 each, so five lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.
* Candies cost $3.20 total, and he got four candies.
* So, the candies cost $3.20 / 4 = $0.80 each.
* Now, we need to add the cost of the lollipops and the candies. 
* 10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
* 10 candies cost 10 * $0.80 = $8.00
* So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00.


**Answer:** $12.00 
"
"Okay, so Rong saves 20 coins a month. Neil saves 2/5 times more, which is like 2/5 * 20 = 8 more coins. So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins a month. 

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

Together they save 240 + 336 = 576 coins in ten years.

"Okay, so the dog needs two vaccines, that's $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.  The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to figure out the total bill.  The total bill is $40 + $40 = $80.  The heartworm check is 60% of $80, so that's $80 * 0.60 = $48.  So the total bill is $80 + $48 = $128.  John has $125, so he leaves with $128 - $125 = $3.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out the price of the bananas and oranges.  Bananas cost twice as much as an apple, so they cost $0.5 * 2 = $1.  Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so they cost $1 * 3 = $3.

Now we know the price of each fruit:

* Apples: $0.5
* Bananas: $1
* Oranges: $3

To find the total price of the crate, we add up the prices of all the fruits: $0.5 + $1 + $3 = $4.50

So the price of the crate is $4.50. 


**$4.50**

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many squares are red, blue, green, and white. 

* Red squares: 14
* Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
* Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
* White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now we know how many squares are in each color.  

To find the total area, we need to multiply the size of each square by the number of squares in each color.

* Red squares: 1 foot * 1 foot = 1 square foot
* Blue squares: 1 foot * 1 foot = 1 square foot
* Green squares: 1 foot * 1 foot = 1 square foot
* White squares: 1 foot * 1 foot = 1 square foot

Now we add up the area of all the squares: 14 * 1 + 18 * 1 + 24 * 1 + 12 * 1 = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 square feet.

So, Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"Okay, so we know there are 8 high chairs.  Mia has 5 times that many regular chairs, so she has 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs.  She needs 42 + 15 = 57 people to sit.  She needs 57 - 40 = 17 more chairs.

"
"Okay, so we have 50 deer and 50% are bucks.  That means 25 deer are bucks.  Then 20% of the bucks are 8 points.  So we need to find out how many of those 25 bucks are 8 points.  That's 20% of 25, which is 5 bucks.

"
"Okay, so Adam got 50 points. Betty is better than Adam, so she got 30% more than Adam, which is 50 * 0.30 = 15 more points. So Betty got 50 + 15 = 65 points. Marta got 3 times more than Tom, who has 30 less than Betty, so Marta got 3 * (65 - 30) = 135 points. 

To get the total points for the class, we add up all the points: 50 + 65 + 135 = 250 points. 

The class is missing 400 - 250 = 150 points.

"
"Okay, so we got three kids, right?  Then each of those kids has three kids, so that's nine kids total.  Then each of those kids has three babies, so that's 27 babies.  So, that's 27 babies plus 9 kids, that's 36 babies.  So, there are 36 babies.  

**36**

"Okay, so Greta gets $2400.00.  She puts half of that in her retirement, which is $1200.00.  Then she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car, which is $480.00.  So, she has $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $640.00 left.

"Hmm, pencils are like... little sticks, right?  So we gotta figure out how many sticks we got left.  We start with 20 pencils, and 4 are gone.  So we have 20 - 4 = 16 pencils left.  Now, we gotta think about how many pairs we can make.  We can make 16 / 2 = 8 pairs.  So the answer is 8.

"Okay, so Hannah's got a lot of fireworks!  

* First, she's got 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks. That's 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks.
* Then, she's gonna set off 3 boxes of fireworks in her backyard, and each box has 5 fireworks. That's 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.
* Now, she's gonna see 40% of the fireworks from her house.  That's 300 fireworks * 0.40 = 120 fireworks.
* So, Hannah will see 120 fireworks from her house. 
* Then, she's gonna see 15 fireworks from her backyard.
* That's a total of 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.

"Okay, so Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can haul 800 more than that, so he can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.  Together, Gissela and Gordy can haul 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.  That leaves 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds for Gary's truck.  So Gary's truck can haul 2,800 pounds.

"Okay, so we know the chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.  That means it makes 50 quarts every 4 hours.  So, if we have 48 hours, we can figure out how many quarts of ice cream they'll make. 

Here's how:

* **Chocolate:** 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour
* **Vanilla:** 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour
* **Total:** 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts

So, the factory will make 2400 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.

"Okay, so I got 5 croissants, 4 cinnamon rolls, 3 mini quiches, and 13 muffins.  That's a lot of food!

* Croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
* Cinnamon Rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
* Mini Quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
* Blueberry Muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, I gotta figure out the total cost.  That's $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

And then I gotta take off 10% for my loyalty card.  That's $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00

So, the final price is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

"Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. 

Here's how to figure that out:

* **Figure out how much money Erin has to spend:** She has $6.00.
* **Figure out how much money she'll spend on the scoops:**  She gets 1 scoop free, so she'll pay for 2 scoops. 
* **Calculate the total cost:** 2 scoops * $1.50/scoop = $3.00
* **Figure out how much money she has left:** $6.00 - $3.00 = $3.00
* **Figure out how many scoops she can buy:** $3.00 / $1.50/scoop = 2 scoops.

"Okay, so 100 people apply, 30% get interviews, 20% of those get a job offer, and a third of those who get a job offer take the job. 

Here's how to solve it:

* 100 people * 30% = 30 people get interviews
* 30 people * 20% = 6 people get job offers
* 6 people * (1/3) = 2 people accept the job

So, **2** people accept the position.

* We start with 170 normal chairs.

* We take away 13 baby chairs.

So, we have 170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left.

"Okay, so the cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.  The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of that time, which is 30 minutes / 3 = 10 minutes. 

So, the dog eats the sausages in 10 minutes.  

Now, we need to find the average time.  We add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes and then divide by 2. 

30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes. 

40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes. 

The average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 20 minutes.

Let's think about it like this:

* Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe.
* So, 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe is 96 inches - 10 inches = 86 inches.
* Bobby's shoe is 86 inches / 9 = 9.5555... inches long.

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 9.5555... inches long.

So, we need to figure out how many people were left.  That's 5000 - 2500 = 2500 people.  Then 2/3 of those people voted, so 2500 * (2/3) = 1666.6666666666667 people voted.  So, 2500 - 1666.6666666666667 = 833.3333333333333 people did not vote by 16:00.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many smores we need to make. 

First, we know 9 kids want 2 smores each, so that's 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores.

Then we got 6 adults eating 1 smore each, so that's 6 adults * 1 smore/adult = 6 smores.

Now we need to add up all the smores: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Now we know we need 24 smores.  Each box has 3 sleeves, and each sleeve makes 8 smores, so we need to figure out how many boxes we need.

24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 boxes.

So we need **3** boxes of graham crackers.

"Okay, so Dora is 15 years old.  

Let's break it down:

* Dora's father is 8 more than twice Dora's age, so he is 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years old.
* Dora's mother is 4 years younger than Dora's father, so she is 38 - 4 = 34 years old.

Now, to find the total combined age, we add up their ages: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.

**Answer: 87**

"Each of Greg's siblings got $20 / 4 = $5.

"Okay, so Cindy has a math book, a science book, a French book, an English book, and a history book.  

* Math book: 2 pounds
* Science book: 2 pounds
* French book: 4 pounds
* English book: 3 pounds
* History book: 3 pounds * 2 = 6 pounds

Now, we add up all the weights: 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 15 pounds.

"Okay, so Candidate A got 20% of the votes.  That means Candidate B got 20% + 50% = 70% of the votes.  So, Candidate C got the rest, which is 100% - 20% - 70% = 10% of the votes. 

So, Candidate C got 10% of 100 votes, which is 10 * 10 = 10 votes.

"Okay, so Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples. Boris gives Beck 10 apples, so Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.  Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples. Beck has 87 - 90 = -3 apples.  

Beck has -3 apples.

"Okay, so Peter wants to make big, big ice cubes, medium cubes, and small cubes.  He has 32 ounces of water.  

* Giant cubes: 3 * 4 ounces = 12 ounces
* Medium cubes: 7 * 2 ounces = 14 ounces
* Small cubes: 8 * 0.5 ounces = 4 ounces

So, he has 32 - 12 - 14 - 4 = 4 ounces left.

"Steven has 10 books.  Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"Okay, so a half-gallon jar is $5 / 2 = $2.50.  A gallon jar is $5, and that's $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, a gallon jar costs $5 + $2 = $7.

Now, for the 10-gallon jars, we need to multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons: $7 * 10 = $70.

For the 16 half-gallon jars, we need to multiply the price per half-gallon by the number of half-gallons: $2.50 * 16 = $40.

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is $70 + $40 = $110.

"Okay, so we know 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like video games or music.  

Here's how to figure out how many like video games:

* **Music:** The number of people who like music is twice the number who like basketball, so 5 like music.
* **Total:**  The rest like video games or music, so we need to find the number of people who like one or the other. 
* **Total:** 50 total students - 10 (bake) - 5 (basketball) = 35 students like video games or music.

"Okay, so Jeremy saw 12 birds. He scared away 1/3 of them, which is 12 / 3 = 4 birds.  So, there are 12 - 4 = 8 birds left. Then 20 more birds come to the backyard. So, there are 8 + 20 = 28 birds now.

"Okay, so we know there are 80 students total.  And 40% of the students are girls.  That means 60% of the students are boys.  So, if we have 80 students, and 60% are boys, we can figure that out.  

Each class has 80 students / 2 = 40 students.  So, each class has 40 students * 0.60 = 24 boys.

"Okay, so I gotta figure out how many animals Melissa can groom each day. 

* Dogs: 8
* Cats: 5
* Birds: 3
* Horses: 12

First, let's add all the animals up: 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals.

Now, we need to divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week: 28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day.

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day.

"Okay, so Mark bought 3 packs of cards for $1800 each, that's $5400 total.  He got 2 good cards, one for $4000 and one for $1000.  That's $5000.  Then he got 30 more cards, and they cost $50 each, so that's $1500.  So, he made $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out the cost for each park. 

First park: 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
          2 children * $12/child = $24
          Total for first park: $52 + $24 = $76

Second park: 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
          2 children * $10/child = $20
          Total for second park: $28 + $20 = $48

They'll save $76 - $48 = $28 if they go to the second park.

"Okay, so he buys 500 tomatoes a day, and they used to be $0.50 each.  Now they are $0.40 each.  That's a difference of $0.10 per tomato.  So, he saves $0.10 per tomato times 500 tomatoes a day, which is $50.00 a day.  That's $50.00 a day times 7 days a week, which is $350.00 a week.

"Okay, so we have 54 students and we need to put them in 12 groups.  We can do that by dividing the students by the number of groups. 

So, we have 54 students and we need 12 groups.  We can do that by dividing the students by the number of groups. 

54 / 12 = 4.5

We can't have half a group, so we need to add more groups.

"Okay, so Candy rents chairs on weekdays and weekends.  

Weekdays she rents 60 chairs a day, and on weekends she rents 100.  

Two 4-week months is 8 weeks.

So, for weekdays she rents 60 chairs a day * 7 days a week = 420 chairs.

For weekends she rents 100 chairs a day * 2 days a week = 200 chairs.

So, for two 4-week months she rents 420 chairs * 2 months = 840 chairs.

And for weekends she rents 200 chairs * 2 months = 400 chairs.

So, in total she rents 840 + 400 = 1240 chairs.

"Okay, so I got a lot of stickers!  I'm gonna trade 'em for buttons.  

* **Small stickers:** I got 30 small stickers. I trade 90% of 'em, which is 30 * 0.9 = 27 small stickers.  
* **Large stickers:** I got 40 large stickers. I trade 50% of 'em, which is 40 * 0.5 = 20 large stickers. 
* **Small buttons:** I got 27 small stickers, and each one is worth 1 small button. So I get 27 * 1 = 27 small buttons.
* **Large buttons:** I got 20 large stickers, and each one is worth 3 small stickers. So I get 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

So, I have 27 small buttons and 60 large buttons.  That's a lot of buttons!

"Okay, so we know there were 33 people on the council.  And the vote was twice as many for as against.  So, if there were 'x' people against, there were 2*x people for.  That means the total votes were 33 + 2*x.  We need to find the value of 'x'.  

Let's think about it this way:

* If there were 1 person against, there would be 2 people for.
* If there were 2 people against, there would be 4 people for.
* If there were 3 people against, there would be 6 people for.
* ... and so on.

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many of each size shirt Krissa ordered. 

* Extra small: 11 students
* Small: Twice as many as extra small, so 11 * 2 = 22 students
* Medium: Four less than small, so 22 - 4 = 18 students
* Large: Half as many as medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students
* Extra large: Six more than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now we add up all the sizes: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 65 shirts.

**Answer: 65**

"Okay, so we got 300 songs and John has 20 playlists.  Each playlist is 10 hours long.  So we just multiply the number of songs by the length of each song.  That's 300 songs times 10 hours per song.  That's 3000 hours. 

**3000** 
"
"Okay, so we have 50 people and 20% think horse #2 will win.  That means 50 people - (20/100) * 50 = 30 people think horse #2 will not win.  60% of the rest think horse #7 will win.  That means 30 people * 0.60 = 18 people think horse #7 will win.  So, the rest of the people think horse #12 will win.  That means 50 - 30 - 18 = 12 people think horse #12 will win. 


**12** 
"
"Okay, so two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.  That means one-third of the puppies are not Pomeranians.  

If one-third of the puppies are girls, and there are 6 girls, that means there are 6 * 3 = 18 puppies. 

So Jana has 18 puppies.

"Okay, so the Llesis family drove 6 hours.  They drove 50 miles per hour.  They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.  So, they hiked 50/2 - 5 = 25 miles per hour.  They hiked for 1.5 hours.  To find out how far they hiked, we multiply their speed by the time they hiked.  So, they hiked 25 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 37.5 miles.  To find the total distance, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.  So, the total distance is 6 hours * 50 miles per hour + 37.5 miles = 300 miles + 37.5 miles = 337.5 miles.

"Okay, so Ava is good at this game!  She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she gets 8 more points for that.  She also gets 3 more berries, so she gets 3 more points for that.  But she finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she gets 4 less points for the timer.  

So, Ava gets 8 * 10 + 3 * 5 + 30 - 4 = 80 + 15 + 30 - 4 = 121 points.

Emma gets 10 * 10 + 5 * 5 + 30 = 100 + 25 + 30 = 155 points.

The difference is 155 - 121 = 34.

"Okay, so Carrie got 10 twenties and 140 quarters.  That's a lot of money!  

First, we gotta figure out how much money Carrie spent on the twenties.  She spent 3/5 of the twenties, so we gotta figure out what 3/5 of 10 twenties is.  

That's like this: 10 * (3/5) = 6 twenties.

Now we gotta figure out how much money Carrie spent on the quarters.  She spent all the quarters, so we gotta figure out how much that is.  

That's 140 quarters.  

Now we gotta add the money from the twenties and the quarters to find the total amount of money Carrie spent.  

That's 6 * 20 + 140 = 120 + 140 = 260.

So Carrie spent 260 dollars on lunch.

So, Samwell sold **25** OLED TVs.

"Okay, so the house is 33 degrees colder at night.  So, the temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.  

Each log heats the house 5 degrees.  So, Carson needs to burn 12 / 5 = 2.4 logs.

"Okay, so we have 90 people and we need to split them into groups of 9.  That's 90 / 9 = 10 groups.  

Now, 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells.  So we need to figure out how many groups there are.  We know there are 10 groups.

So, 10 groups * 2 seashells/group = 20 seashells. 


**20** 
"
"Okay, so we start with 172 people.  First, 47 people get off, so we have 172 - 47 = 125 left. Then 13 more people get on, so we have 125 + 13 = 138.  Finally, 38 people get off, so we have 138 - 38 = 100 people left.

"Damien makes $25 a day.  He makes 30 * $25 = $750 in a month.

"Okay, so Jamie works 8 hours a day and gets $20 an hour.  So, she makes $20 * 8 = $160 a day.  

For the extra hours she worked, she gets paid 150% of $20, which is $20 * 1.50 = $30.

So, she worked 11 hours, so she made $160 + $30 = $190 for the day.

"Okay, so the zookeeper has 12 female lions.  Half as many male lions is 12 / 2 = 6.  That's 6 male lions.  So, there are 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions in the enclosure.

"Okay, so the jeans are 25% off, so they cost 75% of the original price.  

$40 * 0.75 = $30.00

Mike will have $50.00 - $30.00 = $20.00 left over. 

**20.00**

"Okay, so we got 20 new people every month, and they all get $4000 a month.  So, we gotta figure out how much we pay in total for three months. 

* **Month 1:** 20 new people * $4000/person = $80,000
* **Month 2:** 20 new people * $4000/person = $80,000
* **Month 3:** 20 new people * $4000/person = $80,000

Now, we add all that up: $80,000 + $80,000 + $80,000 = $240,000

**Answer:** $240,000

"Okay, so we gotta add up the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"".  

* Deck the Halls is 150 seconds long.
* Jingle Bells is 240 seconds long.

So, 150 + 240 = 390 seconds.

"Okay, so Billy started at $10 an hour and got a raise of $0.50, so he's making $10.50 now.  Then he got a $1.00 raise for his first year, so he's making $11.50 now.  Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's, so she's making $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 an hour.  Billy works 20 hours, and Sally works 20 hours.  Billy makes $11.50 * 20 = $230.  Sally makes $11.00 * 20 = $220.  Billy makes $230 - $220 = $10 more than Sally.

"Okay, so Pierson scored 278 points.  Half of that is 278 / 2 = 139.  Nikita scored 11 more than that, so she scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.  Pierson and Nikita scored 278 + 150 = 428 points in total.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many students and teachers are at the school. 

* There are 40 classes.
* Each class has 25 students and 3 teachers.
* So, there are 40 * 25 = 1000 students.
* There are 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

Now, we know that each student plants one tree and each teacher plants two. 

* Students plant 1000 trees.
* Teachers plant 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

So, the total number of trees is 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.

"Okay, so Bubbles wants 30% of all her stuffed animals to be goats.  

She has 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

"Okay, so Kris plays for half an hour a day for 2 weeks, that's 2 weeks * 7 days/week * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours. 

Then she plays for 2 hours a day for a week, that's 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

So, Kris has played 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours more.

"Okay, so two cars are going fast!  The first car is going 60 miles an hour, and the second car is going 70 miles an hour.  They're both going the same way, so we can just add their speeds together to figure out how far they'll go in two hours. 

First, we need to figure out how far the first car goes in two hours: 60 miles per hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.

Then, we need to figure out how far the second car goes in two hours: 70 miles per hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.

The second car is going faster, so it'll be further ahead.  The difference between them is 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

"Okay, so the diamond is $600 and the gold is $300.  So, that's $600 + $300 = $900.  Then, he pays 30% extra, so he pays $900 * 0.30 = $270 more.  So, he paid $900 + $270 = $1170. 

**$1170**

"Okay, so we gotta figure out the pass rate for the fifth graders. 

* Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
* Fifth graders: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate, so 40 * 2 = 80.
* Total fifth graders: 400
* Total passed: 40 + 80 = 120
* Overall pass rate: (120 / 500) * 100 = 24%

"Okay, so we got 4 students drinkin' 1.5 quarts each, that's 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.  Then we got 16 students drinkin' 2 quarts each, that's 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.  So, we got 6 + 32 = 38 quarts total.  We started with 10 quarts left, so we had 38 + 10 = 48 quarts at the start.

"Okay, so we start with 10 students.  

* **Month 1:** Double the number, so 10 * 2 = 20 students.
* **Month 2:** Double again, so 20 * 2 = 40 students.
* **Month 3:** Double again, so 40 * 2 = 80 students.
* **Month 4:** Double again, so 80 * 2 = 160 students.
* **Month 5:** Double again, so 160 * 2 = 320 students.

So, by the end of May, there would be 320 students. 

**Answer:** 320

"Okay, so Felix made $105 and each branch is $0.25.  I need to figure out how many branches he climbed.  

Here's how:

* **Divide the total money Felix made by the cost per branch:** $105 / $0.25 = 420

**Answer:** Felix climbed 420 branches.

"Okay, so Rose has 3 * 5 + 4 * 6 + 5 * 4 + 6 * 7 = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 81 petals.  She drops one of each type of flower, so she has 81 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 71 petals left. 

**71**

"Okay, so we have 35 marshmallows and they made 9 s'mores each.  That's 9 + 9 = 18 s'mores.  We dropped 3, so we have 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows left.  So, each kid can have 32 / 2 = 16 s'mores.

"Okay, so Jack and his friends are playing games.  We need to figure out how much money they spend.

* Jack plays for 20 minutes, and his friends play for half that time.

* The good friend plays for 1.5 times longer than Jack, so he plays for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

"Okay, so we know Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.  She uses twice as much oil as salt.  And she uses twice as much salt as zest.  Let's break it down:

* **Salt:**  Let's say Tanya uses 'x' ounces of salt.
* **Zest:**  She uses 'x' ounces of zest.
* **Oil:** She uses twice the amount of salt as zest, so she uses 2*x ounces of oil.

Now, we know she uses 10 ounces of the scrub.  We can set up an equation:

x + x + 2*x = 10

Let's solve for x:

4x = 10
x = 10/4
x = 2.5

So, Tanya uses 2.5 ounces of salt.

Now, we can find the amount of oil:

Oil = 2 * x = 2 * 2.5 = 5 ounces.

He sells 20% of his cars, which is 40 * 0.20 = 8 cars.

Then he gives away twice the number he sold to his mom, which is 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

"Okay, so Sasha is a good player at home, but not so good away.  Julie is a good player at home too.  

* First game, Sasha scored 14 points.
* Julie scored 4 less than Sasha, so she scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

* Second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, so she scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

* Total points for Sasha in both games: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"Okay, so Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.  Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has.  We need to figure out how many cards PJ has.  

Let's think about it like this:

* Let's say PJ has 'x' cards.
* Smendrick has 3 * x = 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Now we know the total number of cards is 341.  So:

* x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's solve for x:

* 7x + 12 = 341
* 7x = 329
* x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards.

Now we can find Becca's cards:

* Becca has 3x + 12 = 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Naruto can lift ten times higher than Kagiyami, which is 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.  To get that in feet, we need to convert inches to feet.

* **Total cost:** $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800
* **Money Gabriel has:** $5000 (from working) + $200 (from brother) = $5200
* **Money still needed:** $10800 - $5200 = $5600

"Okay, so Thea gave the craftsman four twenty dollar bills.  That's $20 * 4 = $80.  She gave him $80, and the hat cost $70.  So, she got $80 - $70 = $10 back. 

**10** 
"
"Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, that's 2 * 100 = 200 dollars.  He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, that's 6 * 2 = 12 dollars.  He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, that's 3 * 3 = 9 dollars.  So Craig spends 12 + 9 = 21 dollars.  He has 200 - 21 = 179 dollars left.

"
"Okay, so Jack has 60 dishes.  Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 60 * 2 = 120 socks.  Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.  So, Jack has 30 socks.  Together they have 120 + 60 = 180 socks and dishes. 

**180** 
"
"Okay, so we have 20 students.  Some are good at math, some are good at English, and some are good at both.  

We know 5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only.  That means there are 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 students who are good at both.

So, there are 5 + 8 = 13 students who are good at math or English. 


**Answer: 13** 
"
"Okay, so Vicki has 2 hours for the concert, and each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to leave.  That's a total of 10 minutes for each group.  Vicki has a 10-minute intermission.  So, she can fit in 2 hours / 60 minutes per hour = 33 groups. 

**33** 
"
"Okay, so Brenda put in $300 and it grows at 3/4 of the $300 each year.  So, the first year she gets 3/4 * $300 = $225.  Then the second year she gets 3/4 * $300 = $225.  And the third year she gets 3/4 * $300 = $225.  So, after 3 years she'll have $300 + ($225 * 3) = $300 + $675 = $975. 


**975** 
"
"Okay, so we have white shirts and floral shirts.  Half the white shirts have collars, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 shirts.  We also know 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.  

We need to know how many floral shirts have no buttons.  We can find that by subtracting the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.  That's 50 - 20 = 30 shirts.

So, we have 30 floral shirts with no buttons.  

The answer is 30. 
"
"Okay, so the farmer has 900 eggs.  He put them in trays that hold 30 eggs each.  So, he can make 900 / 30 = 30 trays.  He sells each tray for $2.50.  So, he makes 30 * $2.50 = $75.00. 

**75.00** 
"
"Okay, so Mr. Smith has 55 goats on Farm X and 45 goats on Farm Y. He sold 10 from Farm X and twice as many from Farm Y, which is 10 * 2 = 20 goats.  So, he sold 10 + 20 = 30 goats.  

Now, Farm X has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left. Farm Y has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

Together, they have 45 + 25 = 70 goats left.

"Okay, so you want to know how much it'll cost to buy green and red food.  

Green food is $25, and red food is $18.  You buy 3 green baskets and 3 red baskets.  So you pay $2 off each red basket.  

So you pay $18 * 3 = $54 for the red baskets.  You pay $25 * 3 = $75 for the green baskets.  

You pay $54 + $75 = $129. 


**129** 
"
"Okay, so we got 90 rooms.  We gotta clean half of 'em, so that's 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.  

Each room takes 20 minutes, so we gotta multiply that by 45.  That's 20 * 45 = 900 minutes.

Now we gotta convert that to hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 15 hours.

**Answer: 15 hours** 
"
"Okay, so they build 12 homes the first year, then three times that in the second year, and then double the amount in the third year. 

* First year: 12 homes
* Second year: 12 * 3 = 36 homes
* Third year: 36 * 2 = 72 homes

So, they build 12 + 36 + 72 = 120 homes over the next three years. 

**120** 
"
"Okay, so my brother is the oldest.  I'm three years younger than him.  My sister is younger than me.  My mom is one less than three times my brother's age.  

Let's say my brother is X years old.  I am X-3 years old.  My sister is X-4 years old.  My mom is 3X-2 years old.

The sum of our ages is X + (X-3) + (X-4) + (3X-2) = 87.

That's 7X - 9 = 87.

So, 7X = 96.

X = 14.

I am X-3 years old, so I am 14-3 = 11 years old.

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs. 

We know he has 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks.  

Let's do the math: 27 students / 2 glue sticks per student = 13.5 packs.

Since we can't buy half a pack, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 14 packs of glue sticks.

"
"Okay, so Claire gets one badge a month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets one badge every two months. Wendy gets three times as many badges as Claire, so she gets three badges a month. 

Here's how to figure out the difference:

* **Claire's badges in a year:** 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
* **Amber's badges in a year:** 1 badge/2 months * 12 months = 6 badges
* **Wendy's badges in a year:** 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges
* **Difference:** 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 badges

Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

"Okay, so Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.  Anne has 12 less books than Fawn.  

Let's think about it like this:

* Let's say Fawn has 'x' books.
* Anne has 'x - 12' books.
* Sofie has 'x - 12 + 25' books.

Now, we know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books. So:

x + (x - 12) + (x - 12 + 25) = 85

Let's solve for x:

3x + 13 = 85
3x = 72
x = 24

So, Fawn has 24 books.

"Okay, so Daisy got 5 pounds of potatoes.  That's a lot of potatoes!  The sweet potatoes are twice as much as the potatoes, so they weigh 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds.  The carrots are 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so they weigh 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds. 

So Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many jello cups Greg needs.  

* He wants 30 kids and each kid needs 4 jello cups.
* That means he needs 30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups.
* A box makes 10 jello cups, so he needs 120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes.
* Each box costs $1.25.
* So, he'll need 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.00

"Okay, so Tobias ate 2/5 of 60, which is 2 * 60 / 5 = 24 pieces.  Then he ate 10 more on the second day.  So far he's eaten 24 + 10 = 34 pieces.  Then he ate 7/13 of the rest, which is 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.  So he ate 7/13 of 26, which is 7 * 26 / 13 = 14 pieces.  So Tobias has eaten a total of 34 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"Okay, so Kelly has bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples.  Bacon is $10, and chicken is twice as much as bacon, so chicken is $10 * 2 = $20.  Strawberries are $4 each, and apples are half the price, so apples are $4 / 2 = $2 each.  

Here's how much Kelly has spent: $10 + $20 + 3 * $4 + 7 * $2 = $10 + $20 + $12 + $14 = $56.

Kelly has $65 to spend, and she spent $56, so she has $65 - $56 = $9 left.

We can't figure out how much Tasha made from lemonade without knowing how many times she mowed each lawn.

"Okay, so Calvin has soup for 4 adults and 8 kids.  He's an adult, so he'll eat one bowl. His wife is an adult, so she'll eat one bowl too. That's 2 adults eating.  That means there's soup for 4 adults and 8 kids.  

If everyone eats one bowl, that means there's enough soup for 12 bowls. 

Each child gets 1 bowl.

"Okay, so I need to figure out how much material I need for small masks and large masks. 

Small masks need 2 yards of material each.  So, 20 small masks need 20 * 2 = 40 yards of material.

"Okay, so Benny threw bologna at red and yellow balloons.  He threw two bologna at each red balloon and three at each yellow balloon.  We know he threw 58 bologna total.  We also know 20 of the balloons were red.  So, we can figure out how many yellow balloons there are. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Red balloons:** 20 red balloons * 2 bologna/balloon = 40 bologna
* **Yellow balloons:** 58 bologna - 40 bologna = 18 bologna
* **Yellow balloons:** 18 bologna / 3 bologna/balloon = 6 yellow balloons

So, there were **6** yellow balloons in the bundle.

* **Balloons:** 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons.  They bought 12 balloons for $0.50 each, so that's 12 * $0.50 = $6.00
* **Ice Cream:** They bought 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so that's 2 * $7 = $14.00
* **Total Cost:** The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $11 + $6.00 + $14.00 = $31.00
* **Allowance:**  They had to spend $31.00, so they each got $31.00 / 2 = $15.50

* The class has 30 students, so they made 30 * $7.50 = $225.00.

So the class raised **$225.00** from selling lollipops.

Let's see how much money he has left.  

He has $150.  He spent $10 for 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and $7 for 8 movies on other days.  That's $10 * 5 + $7 * 8 = $50.  He spent $8 on popcorn and $2 on candy, so that's $8 + $2 = $10.  

He has $150 - $50 - $10 = $90 left.  

He can go to the movies 90 / 10 = 9 times.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many calories are in each mini pastry.

* A mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.
* A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
* A mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now we can find the total calories in the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories/mini cinnamon roll = 40,000 calories.

And the total calories in the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories/mini blueberry muffin = 45,000 calories.

So, the total calories in all the pastries is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

That's a total of 48 + 57 = 105 Junebugs.  So, she takes 273 + 105 = 378 Junebugs in all.  That's 378 Junebugs over 6 days.  So, the average is 378 / 6 = 63.

"Okay, so I need to figure out which machine makes more money.  

Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in a day it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.

Now, we need to figure out how much money each machine makes in a month.

Widgeteer 3000 makes 1440 * 30 = $86,400 in a month.

WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 * 30 = $32,400 in a month.

"Okay, so goats need 5 pounds each, and sheep need 3 less than twice that.  So, each sheep needs 2 times 5 - 3 = 7 pounds.  

Now, we have 15 goats and 12 sheep.  That's a lot of hay!  

We need to figure out how much hay the goats need: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

Then we need to figure out how much hay the sheep need: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

Finally, we add the hay for the goats and sheep: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"Okay, so James got 10 CDs for $15 each, that's $150 total.  He gets 40% off, so he pays $150 * 0.40 = $60 less.  That makes it $150 - $60 = $90.  He sells 5 CDs for $40 each, so he makes $40 * 5 = $200.  He's out $200 - $90 = $110.

"Okay, so Bahati scored the most, and it was 20 more than Azibo.  And 10 more than Dinar.  So, let's think about it like this:

* Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo.
* Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar.

If we know Bahati scored 45 points, we can figure out how many points Azibo scored. 

Let's say Azibo scored X points.  Then Bahati scored X + 20 points.  And Dinar scored X - 10 points.

Now, we know that Bahati scored 45 points, so:

X + 20 + (X - 10) = 45

Let's solve for X:

2X + 10 = 45
2X = 35
X = 17.5

So, Azibo scored 17.5 points.

* **Days in two weeks:** 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days
* **Patients admitted:** 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients
* **Total beds occupied:** 700 patients 
* **Total unoccupied beds:** 800 beds - 700 patients = 100 beds

"Okay, so Courtney said 48 people were there.  Kelly thinks that's wrong, and she thinks it was 20% more.  

Let's figure that out.  20% of 48 is like 48 times 0.20.  That's 9.6.  So, Courtney was wrong by 9.6 people.  

To find the real number of people, we need to add that to the number Courtney said.  So, 48 plus 9.6 is 57.6.  

But we can't have a fraction of a person, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number.  

So, the real number of people at the concert was 57.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many Pokemon Stan caught.  

Let's break it down:

* **Let's use some letters:**
    * Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon.
    * Stan caught 'S' Pokemon.
    * Alex caught 'A+5' Pokemon.

* **We know this:**
    * Alex + Stan + Adelwolfe = 339 Pokemon
    * A + S + (A+5) = 339

* **Let's solve for A:**
    * A + S + A + 5 = 339
    * 2A + S + 5 = 339
    * 2A + S = 334

* **Let's solve for S:**
    * Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch.
    * Stan caught S = 4A - 13

* **Now we can plug in A:**
    * 2A + (4A - 13) = 334
    * 6A - 13 = 334
    * 6A = 347
    * A = 57.83

* **We can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, so let's adjust our thinking:**
    * We know Adelwolfe caught A Pokemon.
    * Stan caught S Pokemon.
    * Alex caught A+5 Pokemon.

* **Let's try a different approach:**
    * We know Alex caught 5 more than Stan.
    * Stan caught S Pokemon.
    * Alex caught A+5 Pokemon.

* **Let's solve for S:**
    * Stan caught S = 4A - 13
    * Stan caught S = 4(57.83) - 13
    * Stan caught S = 231.32 - 13
    * Stan caught S = 218.32

* **We can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, so let's adjust our thinking:**
    * We know Adelwolfe caught A Pokemon.
    * Stan caught S Pokemon.
    * Alex caught A+5 Pokemon.

* **Let's try a different approach:**
    * We know Alex caught 5 more than Stan.
    * Stan caught S Pokemon.

* **Let's solve for S:**
    * Stan caught S = 4A - 13
    * Stan caught S = 4(57.83) - 13
    * Stan caught S = 231.32 - 13

"Okay, so we know each episode is 20 minutes long.  And there are half as many episodes as minutes in the show.  So, we need to figure out how many minutes are in the show.  

Let's do it!

* Minutes in the show = 20 minutes/episode * number of episodes 
* We know there are half as many episodes as minutes in the show, so we can write that as 20 minutes/episode * 1/2 = number of episodes.
* We can now solve for the number of episodes: 20 minutes/episode * 1/2 = number of episodes
* So, the number of episodes is 20 minutes/episode * 1/2 = 10 minutes/episode.
* Now we can calculate the total minutes: 20 minutes/episode * 10 episodes = 200 minutes.

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"Okay, so Mrs. Harrington got 12 boxes of oranges. She gave some to her mom and sister, and then she kept some.  

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. That's 2 + 2 = 4 boxes gone.

Now she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept 8 / 4 = 2 boxes.

She sold the rest, so she sold 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Each box has 20 oranges, so she sold 6 * 20 = 120 oranges.

"Okay, so Sunny sold gingerbread and apple pie.  

On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 less than that on Sunday.  So, on Sunday he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more gingerbread than Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

So, he made $6 * 10 + $15 * 15 = $60 + $225 = $285.

"Okay, so Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long.  That's a lot of space!  She wants to put plants 1.5 feet apart.  So, how many plants can she fit in her flower bed?

First, we need to figure out how many feet are in a plant.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so 1 foot is 12 inches.  

Now, we need to figure out how many feet are in 17 flowers.  We know that each flower is 12 inches wide, so we need to figure out how many inches are in 17 flowers.  

We can do that by multiplying the number of flowers by the width of each flower.  So, 17 flowers * 12 inches/flower = 204 inches.  

Now we need to figure out how many feet are in 204 inches.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so 204 inches / 12 inches/foot = 17 feet.

Now we know that Pat can fit 17 feet of flowers in her bed.  She needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, so she can fit 17 feet / 1.5 feet/plant = 11.33 plants.  

Since she can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 11 plants in her bed.  

Now we need to figure out how much each plant costs.  Each plant costs $6.  So, 11 plants * $6/plant = $66.

**Answer:** $66

Then, the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each, and she's putting 2 in each basket.  So, that's 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines.

Now, we gotta add up the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines.  That's 15 * $3.00 + 10 * $2.50 = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

So, she'll spend $70.00 filling all 5 baskets.

"Okay, so Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls twice as long, so he howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.  And Igneous howls as long as Tobias and Chikote together, so he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  The total time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  That's 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Okay, so Adam got $30 for his new pants. His mom gave him $6, and his dad gave him twice that, so that's $6 * 2 = $12.  So, he got $30 + $6 + $12 = $48.  He had to use $48 - $30 = $18 from his savings.

"Okay, so we know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4.  Helene is twice the average age, so we need to find the average age of the group.  

The total age is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Helene is twice the average age, so she is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

The total age of the group is 20, and Akbar is 3, Alessandro is 4, and Helene is 10, so Wilfred is 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3 years old.

"Okay, so there were 100 guests at the wedding and each guest brought 15 cookies.  The bride gave half the cookies to the church, so she gave 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest / 2 = 75 cookies to the church.  If each person in the church got 15 cookies, then there were 75 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 5 people in the church.

He has 9 hours at the clinic, so he has 9 * 60 = 540 minutes.  He has 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.  He has 540 - 480 = 60 minutes left.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out when to start. 

* Batter takes 20 minutes.
* Baking takes 30 minutes.
* Cooling takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
* Frosting takes 10 minutes.

So, let's add all that up: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to figure out how much time we have left to make the cake. 

We want to be done by 5:00 pm.  That's 60 minutes.

So, we need to figure out how much time we have left to make the cake. 

180 minutes - 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Okay, so Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, that's like 3.5 boxes.  Peter sold 4 and a half boxes, that's 4.5 boxes.  Together they sold 64 chocolate bars.  We need to find out how many bars are in a box.  

Let's think about it like this:

* Lisa's boxes: 3.5 boxes *  *number of bars per box = number of bars Lisa sold*
* Peter's boxes: 4.5 boxes * *number of bars per box = number of bars Peter sold*
* Together: Lisa's bars + Peter's bars = 64

We can solve for the number of bars per box by figuring out how many boxes they sold. 

Let's say there are 'x' bars in a box. 

Lisa's bars: 3.5 boxes * x = 3.5x
Peter's bars: 4.5 boxes * x = 4.5x

Together: 3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Now we can solve for x. 
* 8x = 64
* x = 64 / 8
* x = 8

So, there are **8** chocolate bars in a box.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much money they make per session and then how many sessions they have in a month. 

First, the cost per session is $25 plus $1.50 per student. So, that's $25 + ($1.50 * 10 students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Now, they rent the studio 3 days a week. So, in a month, they have 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 days.

So, the total earnings are $40 per session * 12 days = $480.

**Answer: $480** 
"
"Okay, so Peter has 64 chocolate bars and Martha has 56.  We need to find out how many more Peter has than Martha. 

Peter has 64 bars and Martha has 56.  We can do this by subtracting Martha's number of bars from Peter's number of bars. 

64 - 56 = 8.

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"Okay, so we know there are 50 porcupines in the park.  

The number of females is 3/5 of 50, which is 3 * 10 = 30.

Each female has 4 babies a month, so in a year, they'll have 4 * 12 = 48 babies.

So, the total number of porcupines will be 50 + 30 + 48 = 128.

**128** 
"
"Okay, so the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  We need to find the volume of the pool.  

Volume = width x length x depth

Volume = 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet

Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Now we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the gallons.

Gallons = Volume x 5.9

Gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 5.9

Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Gallons x $0.10 per gallon

Cost = 8260 gallons x $0.10 per gallon

Cost = $826.00

So it will cost $826.00 to fill the pool. 


**$826.00**

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much water they pumped in total. 

Wanda pumped 1/4 of 18000 gallons, which is 4500 gallons. 

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of that, which is 3/4 * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of 4500 gallons, which is 2/3 * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of 4500 gallons, which is 1/3 * 4500 gallons = 1500 gallons.

So, they pumped a total of 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1500 = 12375 gallons.

Now, we need to find out how much water is left. 18000 gallons - 12375 gallons = 5625 gallons.

"Okay, so here's what we know:

* **First, the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours.**  That means it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.
* **Then, it lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours.** That means it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.
* **We know the power bank had 28% charge left.**

**To find the original charge, we need to figure out how much charge was lost in total.**

Let's think about it like this:

* **After the first 5 hours, the power bank had 100% - 45% = 55% charge left.**
* **After the next 3 hours, it had 55% - 21% = 34% charge left.**

**So, the power bank had 34% charge left when it was at the park.**

Here's how to figure out how many weeks she needs to work:

* **Calculate her weekly earnings:** $25 an hour * 40 hours a week = $1,000 a week
* **Figure out how many weeks to save:** $2,000 / $1,000 a week = 2 weeks

She needs to work **2 weeks** to save the down payment.

Let's see how much money he has left.  He has $10.00.  

He has already spent $3.00 on peaches, $2.00 on pears, $1.00 on kiwis, and $3.75 on apples.  That's a total of $10.00 - $3.00 - $2.00 - $1.00 - $3.75 = $0.25 left.

"Okay, so the carrot price goes up each year.  So, the price after one year would be 120 + (5/100)*120 = 120 + 6 = 126.  Then the price after two years would be 126 + (5/100)*126 = 126 + 6.3 = 132.3.  And the price after three years would be 132.3 + (5/100)*132.3 = 132.3 + 6.615 = 138.915.  Round to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is 139.

"Okay, so Teresa sells big stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones.  That means if she sells a small one, she sells a big one for three times the price.  She made $120 total, and we know each small one costs $4.  So, let's figure out how many small stuffed animals she sold. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Big animals:** Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as big ones.
* **Small animals:** Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
* **Total earnings:** She made $120.

We can use this information to figure out how many small stuffed animals she sold. 

Let's break it down:

1. **Let's say she sold 'x' number of small stuffed animals.**
2. **Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as big ones, she sold 2x big stuffed animals.**
3. **The price of the big stuffed animals is 3 times the price of the small ones, so the price of a big stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.**
4. **The total earnings from the small stuffed animals is $4 * x.**
5. **The total earnings from the big stuffed animals is $12 * 2x = $24x.**
6. **The total earnings from the sales is $120, so $4x + $24x = $120.**
7. **Combine the terms: $28x = $120**
8. **Divide both sides by 28 to find x: x = $120 / $28 = 4.29**

Since we can't sell fractions of stuffed animals, we know that Teresa sold 4 small stuffed animals.

"Okay, so the man eats 5 sandwiches a day, the wife eats 4, and the son eats 2.  That's 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches a day.  Now, we need to figure out how many sandwiches they eat in a week.  There are 7 days in a week, so they eat 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches in a week.

"Okay, so Suzanne sold cookies and cupcakes.  She got money from selling them.  She gave some money to her sisters.  I need to figure out how much money she has left.

* Cookies: 80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80
* Cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240
* Total money from selling: $80 + $240 = $320
* Money given to sisters: $10/sister * 2 sisters = $20
* Money left: $320 - $20 = $300

"The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so they found 30 * 2 = 60 eggs.  The other eggs were 100 - 60 = 40 eggs.  The friends found 40 eggs.

"Okay, so a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines twice as much as the one with an iron pickaxe.  That means the steel pickaxe dwarf mines 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.  

Now, we need to figure out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine in a month.  

First, we need to figure out how much ore each dwarf mines in a day.  A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 24 pounds per day.

Then, we need to figure out how much ore 40 dwarves mine in a day.  40 dwarves * 24 pounds per dwarf = 960 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, we need to figure out how much ore they mine in a month.  960 pounds per day * 30 days = 28,800 pounds of ore.

**28,800** 
"
"Okay, so we know the first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.  The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.  That means the price goes up by $3 for every two sandwiches.  So, the third package with 8 sandwiches will cost $6 * 2 = $12.

"Okay, so Tom got a new bed set for $3000. He sold his old bed for $1000.  That means he has $2000 left.  He has to pay 10% of $3000 a month.  That's like 10/100 times 3000, which is 300.  So he has to pay $300 a month.

"
"Okay, so Sally had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons.  

First, the wind blew some of the red balloons.  That's 25 * 0.40 = 10 red balloons popped.  She has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

Then, Sally let go of half of the yellow balloons. That's 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons gone.  She has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

She found 8 blue balloons in a tree.  She added 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons to her balloons.  She has 6 + 15 + 6 = 27 balloons.

So, Sally has 27 balloons in total.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Substitute Teacher:** 50% chance no homework
* **Normal Teacher:** 40% chance extension
* **Marcus's Extension:** 20% chance of getting an extension

To get the final percentage, we need to consider all the possibilities:

* **No homework, no extension:** 50% * 100% = 50%
* **No homework, extension:** 50% * 40% = 20%
* **Homework, no extension:** 50% * 60% = 30%
* **Homework, extension:** 50% * 20% = 10%

**Total chance of having to turn in homework:** 50% + 20% + 30% + 10% = **110%**

**Wait, that doesn't make sense!**  

It seems like there's a mistake in the problem.  The percentages don't add up to 100%.

"Okay, so we got three people and they got $1920.  The second person got $80 more than the first.  The third person got twice what the second person got.  

Let's say the first person got $x.  The second person got $x + $80.  The third person got $2 * ($x + $80).

So, the first person got $x.  The second person got $x + $80.  The third person got $2 * ($x + $80).

We know that the total amount of money is $1920.  So, we can write an equation:

$x + ($x + $80) + $2 * ($x + $80) = $1920

Now, let's solve for x.

"Okay, so we got 4 painters and they work 3/8 of a day each day.  That's like 3/8 * 1 day = 3/8 of a day.  

Now we gotta figure out how many days they worked for 3 weeks.  That's 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

So, they worked 21 days * 3/8 of a day/day = 63/8 of a day.

Now we gotta figure out how many hours that is.  There are 24 hours in a day, so that's 63/8 * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

So each painter worked 189 hours. 


**189** 
"
"Okay, so Rory got 19 balls total.  He got half as many in the third set as the second, so the third set was 19 / 2 = 9 balls.  He got 4 more balls in the first set than the second, so the second set was 19 - 9 = 10 balls.  So the first set was 10 - 4 = 6 balls.

"Okay, so the car is getting old and losing money, right?  So, we gotta figure out how much it's worth in 2010.  

First, we gotta figure out how much the car is worth after one year.  We know it loses 21% of its value, so we gotta do that math.  

20000 * 0.21 = 4200.  

So, the car is worth 20000 - 4200 = 15800 after one year.

Now, we gotta do this again for the next year.  

20000 * 0.21 = 4200.

So, the car is worth 15800 - 4200 = 11600 after two years.

We gotta keep doing this for every year.  

So, the car is worth 11600 after two years. 



**11600**

"Okay, so half the books are English, and 10% are German.  That means the rest are Spanish.  

We know there are 50 books total, so half are English and 10% are German.  That means 50 / 2 = 25 books are English.  

Then we know 50 - 25 = 25 books are German.  

So, the rest are Spanish.  

25% of 50 books is 12.5.  

So, there are 12.5 books in Spanish. 



**12.5**

"Okay, so Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days.  That's a lot of driving!  

She needs to go 1955 - 325 = 1630 kilometers more.

"Okay, so Ingrid drinks 8 cups a day.  That's like, a lot of water!  

To figure out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days, we need to know how many gallons are in 30 days.  

* 8 cups a day * 30 days = 240 cups 
* 240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"Okay, so Romeo starts with 120 people.  Then 20 more get on at the first stop.  That's 120 + 20 = 140 people.  Then 50 people get off at the second stop.  That's 140 - 50 = 90 people left.  Then 100 people get on at the second stop.  That's 90 + 100 = 190 people.  Then 80 more get off at the third stop.  That's 190 - 80 = 110 people.  So the final answer is 110.

"Okay, so Alison got a tank top for $10.  The shorts cost $5 more than that, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.  The tennis shoes were half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.  The socks were $8 and she got a $2 off coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.  So, she spent $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55 on athletic gear.

"Okay, so James's insurance is 60% more expensive now.  That means it's like he's paying 160% of the normal price.  

So, he pays $120 * 1.60 = $192 a month.

A year is 12 months, so he pays $192 * 12 = $2304 a year.

"Okay, so Greg has 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds.  He washes 2 twin sets + 1 king set = 3 sets of sheets a week.  

Greg does 3 sets of sheets a week * 5 beds = 15 sets of sheets a week.

Greg does 15 sets of sheets a week * 52 weeks a year = 780 sets of sheets a year.

Greg does 780 sets of sheets a year.

Now, they watch movies every weekend, so they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies each weekend.

Over 4 weeks, they watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

And then they charge $6 for parking, that's like, a lot of parking!  So, that's $12.  So, the total cost is $300 + $120 + $12 = $432.

"Okay, so James gets 80 emails a day.  That's a lot of emails!  

20% of those emails don't need a response, so he gets 80 * 0.20 = 16 emails that he doesn't need to answer.

That leaves him with 80 - 16 = 64 emails that he needs to respond to.

Now, he works 5 days a week, so he needs to answer 64 emails over 5 days.

So, he responds to 64 emails / 5 days = 12.8 emails per day.

* Wednesday: Three times as many as Tuesday, so 64 * 3 = 192 classes
* Thursday: 30 classes
* Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add all those up: 32 + 64 + 192 + 30 + 25 = 323 classes

So, in all, **323** classes visited the Science Center last week.

"Okay, so Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons.  That means he's sending out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons. 

Now we need to figure out how much it costs to mail all the coupons. 

* Small coupons cost 5 cents each, and he's sending 700 of them, so that's 700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars.
* Big coupons cost 15 cents each, and he's sending 1400 of them, so that's 1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons: 35 + 210 = 245 dollars.

"Okay, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.  Then Mark ate 4 of them.  So, Sidney has 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.  Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, so there are 3 * 4 = 12 meatballs left.

So, 400 tons of fertiliser is the total amount that was sent out.

"Okay, so Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, which is 6 * 12 = 72 croissants.  He uses 1 pound of butter per dozen, so he needs 72 / 12 = 6 pounds of butter.  The promotion is for buy one pound get one half off, so he gets 6 pounds of butter for 6 / 2 = 3 pounds of butter at half price.  The cost of the butter is $4.00 a pound, so he pays 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

"Okay, so Kayla has 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 people.

* Third train leaves: 100 minutes
* Fourth train: 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so 100 + 20 = 120 minutes

So, Paul will wait for 120 minutes.

"Okay, so the watch was 75% of the original price.  That means the watch cost $2000 * 0.75 = $1500.  Then Mr. Rogers sold it for 120% of that price, which is $1500 * 1.20 = $1800.  The friend got $1800 - $1500 = $300 off the original price.  That's a 300/1500 = 20% discount.

"Okay, so we got 5 springs, and each spring makes a new jellyfish every second.  That means in 1 second, 1 jellyfish is made.  So in 4 hours, we got 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour * 60 seconds per minute = 14,400 seconds.  So, 14,400 seconds * 5 springs = 72,000 jellyfish.

"Okay, so he walked 4 miles to the store and then had to walk back.  That's 4 miles to the store and 4 miles back, so that's 8 miles total.  He walks 4 miles an hour, so it took him 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

"Okay, so I need to figure out how many bananas Jenny bought. 

She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, if she bought the bananas individually, she would have spent 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

But she bought them in bunches, and each bunch is $3.00. So she saved $32.00 - $3.00 = $29.00.

**29.00**

"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  That means Sam gets 100 - 60 = 40 feet.  So, Harry gets 100 + 60 = 160 feet.  That means there is 100 - 160 = -60 feet left over.  


**-60**

"Okay, so the crocodile grows 8 inches every 4 years.  So, if it grows 8 inches in 4 years, it will grow 8 * 3 = 24 inches in 12 years.  Then, in 13 years, it will grow 24 * 13 = 312 inches.

"Okay, so Marcel sells MTBs, BMXs, and Trekking bikes.  

* MTBs cost $500 each.
* BMXs cost half the price of MTBs, so they cost $500 / 2 = $250 each.
* Trekking bikes cost $450 each.

He sold 300 bikes total.  Half were Trekking, so he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

He also sold 15% BMX bikes, so he sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

The rest were MTBs, so he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTBs.

So, he sold 105 MTBs at $500 each, for a total of 105 * $500 = $52,500.

**Answer:** $52,500

"Okay, so the farmer makes 5 bales an hour and the truck picks up 3 bales an hour.  That means the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales and the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.  So, the truck and farmer together make 30 + 18 = 48 bales.  But we need to know how many bales are left.  

The farmer makes 30 bales and the truck picks up 18 bales.  So, there are 30 - 18 = 12 bales left.

"Okay, so John has 6 periods a day, and he takes 2 extra classes, that's 2 * 40 = 80 minutes extra.  He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes.  He spends 1/16 of his time on the weekend, so that's 400 minutes / 16 = 25 minutes.  He spends 25 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.  That's 25 minutes * 2 days = 50 minutes.  So, he spends 400 minutes + 50 minutes = 450 minutes a week learning.  That's 450 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 7.5 hours.

"Okay, so the ball goes 2/3 of the height of the first bounce on the second bounce.  The first bounce is 24 feet high, so the second bounce is 2/3 of 24 feet. 

2/3 of 24 feet is 16 feet. 

So the ball goes 16 feet on the second bounce.

"Okay, so the first child is 6 feet tall.  The second is 2 inches taller, so that's 6 feet + 2 inches = 6 feet 2 inches.  The third is 5 inches shorter, so that's 6 feet 2 inches - 5 inches = 6 feet 7 inches.  The fourth is 3 inches taller, so that's 6 feet 7 inches + 3 inches = 7 feet 10 inches.  

**7 feet 10 inches**

"Okay, so we know they sold 2000 apples.  And each bag is 10 apples.  So we need to figure out how many bags they sold.  2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags.  Then we multiply that by the price per bag: 200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000.

"Okay, so we got four walls.  The north and south are 10 by 8, and the east and west are 5 by 8.  We need to find the area of all the walls.  

The north and south are 10 x 8 = 80 square feet.
The east and west are 5 x 8 = 40 square feet.
So, the total area is 80 + 40 = 120 square feet.

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we need 120 / 20 = 6 gallons.

A gallon costs $12, so 6 gallons cost 6 x $12 = $72.

"Okay, so two trains, one fast and one slow, they go in opposite directions.  The fast one goes 60 miles an hour, the slow one half that, so 30 miles an hour.  We gotta figure out how far they go in three hours.  

The fast train goes 60 miles in three hours, that's 60 * 3 = 180 miles.  The slow train goes 30 miles in three hours, that's 30 * 3 = 90 miles.  

So, the fast train is 180 miles ahead of the slow train.

"Okay, so Billy works for 3 hours a day, and he can help 2 people per hour.  That means he helps 6 people a day. 

He works for 31 days in March, and 19 days in April.  So he works 31 + 19 = 50 days.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

He works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

He helps 40 days * 6 people per day = 240 people.

"Okay, so we know there were 20 cars and 12 buses.  The buses had 35 people each, and the cars had 3 people each.  We need to find out how many people were inside the church. 

We can do that by adding up the people in the buses and the people in the cars. 

* Buses: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people
* Cars: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people
* Total: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people

So, there were **480** people inside the church.

"Okay, so the biggest slide is 300 feet long and goes 60 feet per minute. The second slide is 240 feet long and goes 80 feet per minute. 

To figure out how much longer it takes to ride the big slide, we need to figure out how long it takes to ride the big slide. 

We can do that by dividing the length of the big slide by the speed: 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes.

Now we can do the same for the second slide: 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes.

The big slide takes 5 minutes to ride, and the second slide takes 3 minutes to ride. 

The big slide is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes longer.

So Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 1 hour.

"Okay, so Lauren wants to save for 20 years.  She saves 20% of her paycheck.  That's a lot of money!  

I need to know how much she saves each paycheck.

"Okay, so we got red balls, blue balls, and green balls.  We need to know how much each color is worth.  Red is $9, blue is $5, and green is $3.  We need to count all the balls and then multiply the price of each color by the number of balls.  

Red balls: 3 balls * $9/ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5/ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3/ball = $75

Now we add all the money together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have $157 after all the balls are sold.

* To blink 459 times, we need to figure out how many 0.02 minutes it takes. 
* 459 times / 0.02 minutes per blink = 22950 minutes.

So 3x = 68, and x = 22.  So Arnold painted 22 eggs.  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted 22 + 12 = 34 eggs.  Camden painted 34 - 22 = 12 more eggs than Arnold.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight of the boxes to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

"Okay, so John cuts down a big tree!  He makes logs out of it, and then cuts those logs into planks.  He sells each plank for $1.2.  That's a lot of planks!

Here's how we can figure out how much money he makes:

* **Logs:** He cuts 80% of the tree into logs.  That's like taking 80 out of every 100 feet.
* **Planks:** He cuts 5 planks from each log.
* **Total Planks:** He makes 80 feet / 4 feet per log = 20 logs.
* **Total Planks:** He makes 20 logs * 5 planks per log = 100 planks.
* **Total Money:** He sells each plank for $1.2, so he makes 100 planks * $1.2 per plank = $120.

**Answer:** John makes $120.

Here's how to figure out how long it takes her:

* **Beach time:** 40 minutes
* **Sidewalk time:**  We need to figure out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. 
* **Sidewalk speed:** She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, so we need to figure out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile at twice the speed. 
* **Time on the sidewalk:** We can use the time she spends on the beach to figure out how long it takes her to walk the sidewalk. 

Let me know if you want to try to figure that out!

"Jane saves $4 each week.  So, she has saved $4 * 8 = $32.  She needs to save $60 - $32 = $28 more.  She will save $28 / $4 = 7 more weeks.

"Okay, so we got 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.  Then we got 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.  And then we got 1 tree with 3 blue birds.  So, 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"Okay, so Bob starts with a certain number of marbles.  He gets 2 dozen more, which is 2 * 12 = 24 more marbles.  That means he has 60 marbles now.  He loses 10 marbles, so he has 60 - 10 = 50 marbles left.

"Okay, so Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  He gets 20 more cows every day for three weeks.  That's a lot of cows!  He also gets 10 chickens every day from Broilers Limited.  

So, here's how we can figure out the total number of animals:

* **Cows:** 50 + (20 cows/day * 3 weeks) = 50 + 60 = 110 cows
* **Chickens:** 20 + (10 chickens/day * 3 weeks) = 20 + 30 = 50 chickens

**Total:** 110 cows + 50 chickens = 160 animals

**Answer:** 160

"Okay, so Russell gets 4 packs of bagels, that's 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.  He gets a 10% discount, so he pays 90% of the price.  That's 0.90 * 10 = 9 dollars off.  So, he pays 10 dollars per pack * 0.90 = 9 dollars for the bagels.  So, each bagel costs 9 dollars / 36 bagels = 0.25 dollars.

"Okay, so Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.  That means he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.  

Now, it says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.  That means it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 1 scoop.

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 1 scoop.  So, he ate 18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

"Okay, so Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, that's 3 * 30 = 90 eggs. Then he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days, that's 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.  So, he eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs in total.  To figure out how many dozens he needs for 60 days, we need to know how many dozens are in 240 eggs.  A dozen has 12 eggs, so 240 / 12 = 20 dozens.

"Okay, so we know there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans, so there are 17 * 2 = 34 red jelly beans.  That's a total of 17 + 34 = 51 jelly beans.  The rest are blue, so there are 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans.

"Okay, so I sell sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8.  I made $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets.  That means I sold 26 / 2 = 13 sunflowers.  Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so I sold 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets.  That means I sold 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

"Okay, so Adam wants to sell rocks. He buys them for $5 each and sells them for $7 each.  He has $100.  

He can buy 20 rocks ($100 / $5 = 20).  He sells 60% of his rocks, which is 12 rocks ($7 * 12 = $84).

He makes a profit of $84 - $5 * 20 = $84 - $100 = -$16.

He loses $16.

"Okay, so Lauren can draw a lot of pictures!  

Here's how to figure out how many days it will take her:

* **Large scenes:** 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
* **Medium scenes:** 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
* **Small scenes:** 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

**Total days:** 9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days

It will take Lauren **22 days** to finish all the pictures.

"Okay, so Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, that's easy. Then he went another 140 miles in 3 hours.  

First, we need to find Sid's speed for each trip. 

For the first trip, he went 110 miles in 2 hours, so his speed was 110 miles / 2 hours = 55 miles per hour.

For the second trip, he went 140 miles in 3 hours, so his speed was 140 miles / 3 hours = 46.67 miles per hour (round to the nearest tenth).

Now, to find his average speed, we add up his speeds for both trips and divide by the total time. 

(55 miles per hour + 46.67 miles per hour) / 5 hours = 51.34 miles per hour. 

So, Sid's average speed was 51.34 miles per hour.

"Okay, so the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one.  That means it's 3 times 20% which is 60%.  So, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning.  To find the chance of both winning, we just multiply the chances together. 20% times 60% is 12%.

"Okay, so Jim had 27 seashells, and Carlos had twice as many as Carrey.  Let's figure that out. 

* **Let's say Carrey collected x seashells.**
* **Carlos collected 2x seashells (because he collected twice as many as Carrey).**
* **Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than Carlos.**

**So, we know:**
* Carlos collected 2x seashells
* Jim collected 27 seashells
* Carrey collected x seashells

**To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to figure out how many seashells they had in total.**

**Let's add up the seashells:**
* Carlos: 2x
* Jim: 27
* Carrey: x

**To find out how many seashells they have in total, we need to add them all up.**

**Let's add up the seashells:**
* 2x + 27 + x = 3x + 27

**Now, we need to divide the total seashells by the number of people to find out how many each person gets.**

**To divide the total seashells by the number of people, we need to know how many people are there.**

**We know there are 3 people: Carlos, Jim, and Carrey.**

**Let's divide the total seashells by the number of people:**
* (3x + 27) / 3 = x + 9

**We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than Carlos.**

**Let's solve for x:**
* 2x = 27 - 5
* 2x = 22
* x = 11

**Now that we know Carrey collected 11 seashells, we can find out how many each person got.**

**Let's divide the total seashells by the number of people:**
* (3 * 11 + 27) / 3 = 11 + 9 = 20

**So, each person got 20 seashells.**


**Final answer: 20**

"Okay, so the second song is 60% longer than the first song.  That's like, half of the first song, right?  So, the second song is 5 minutes * 1.60 = 8 minutes long.  The total time is 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

"Okay, so Linus bought 2 phones on Monday for $20 each, that's $40. Then he bought 4 phones on Tuesday for $20 each, that's $80.  He sold all the phones for twice the price he bought them for, so he made $40 * 2 = $80 on Monday and $80 * 2 = $160 on Tuesday.  That's a total of $80 + $160 = $240.  He made $240 - $40 - $80 = $120 profit.

"Okay, so Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so his cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many bottles Hortex needs to make to cover the energy needs of 2300 people. 

First, we need to know how much energy each person needs.  Each juice covers 20% of one person's energy needs.

So, we need to find out how much energy 2300 people need.  

* 2300 people * 100% = 2300 energy needs.
* 2300 people * 0.20 = 460 energy needs per person.
* 2300 people * 460 = 105,800 energy needs.

Now we know Hortex needs to make enough juice to cover 105,800 energy needs.

Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's energy needs.

* 105,800 energy needs / 0.20 = 52900 bottles of juice.

Hortex needs to make 52900 bottles of juice to cover the energy needs of 2300 people.

"Okay, so we have 8 babies. 3/4 of them are purple, and 1/4 are blue.  We need to figure out the chance a baby wearing a bow is purple. 

Here's how we do it:

* **Purple babies with bows:**  (3/4) * (1/3) = 1/4
* **Blue babies with bows:** (1/4) * (1/3) = 1/12

So, 1/4 of the babies wearing bows are purple.

"Okay, so we know they got 1907 on Monday and Tuesday, and 2136 on Thursday and Friday.  That's a lot of reports!  

So, if we take all the reports they got, we can figure out how many they got on Wednesday.  

Let's add up the reports they got on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports they got on Thursday and Friday. 

1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, we can subtract that number from the total number of reports they got last week to find out how many they got on Wednesday.

4043 - 5168 = -1125

That doesn't make sense!  We can't have a negative number of reports.  Maybe there's a mistake in the numbers.

"Okay, so Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.  He sold that for $50. Then he sold another 1/4, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. He sold that for $30.  He has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sells that for $3 per square meter, so he will make 20 * 3 = $60. 

So, Abraham will make $60 after selling all his land.

"Okay, so Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice that, so she found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.  So, all together they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.  There were 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.  So, there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs left hidden.

"Okay, so John has 3 places to go.  The first two have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.  The last place is 60% bigger, so it's 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.  That makes it 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.  He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so that's 3 * 640 = 1920 apartments.  He gets $0.40 per apartment, so he makes 1920 * $0.40 = $768.

First, we need to figure out how long the yellow rope is.  We know the blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so we can say the yellow rope is 37 cm - 7 cm = 30 cm long.

Now we know the blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so the blue rope is 30 cm - 7 cm = 23 cm long.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is 4 * 23 cm = 92 cm long.

"Okay, so Ronnie got $5 and Rissa got 3 times that, so Rissa got $5 * 3 = $15.  

They both gave some money to their little sister.  After that, Rissa has 4/5 of her money left.  That means she had $15 - (4/5) * $15 = $15 - $12 = $3 left.

So, Ronnie gave $5 - $3 = $2 to their little sister. 


**Answer:** $2

"Okay, so we know the mural has red, white, purple, and yellow paint.  Half the mural is yellow, so that's 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.  Now, we know there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, so we can figure out how much of each color there is.  If we have 12 pints total, and 6 pints are yellow, that means the other 6 pints are split between red and white and purple.  We can figure out how much of each color is in the mural by dividing the total amount of paint by 3.  So, each color is 12 pints / 3 = 4 pints.  So, the red paint is 4 pints.

"Okay, so Tom has 4 bedrooms, each 20 by 12 feet.  That's 4 times 20 times 12, which is 960 square feet.  The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 5 times 20 times 12, which is 1200 square feet.  The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  So, the total area is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet. 

**3160**

"Okay, so Monday she sees 3 clouds.  Tuesday she sees 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.  Wednesday she sees 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.  Thursday she sees 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.  Friday she sees 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.  So, in total she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

"Okay, so we got a special box with more pods!  

We know the regular box has 100 pods and costs $12.  The new box has 20% more pods, so it has 100 + (20/100) * 100 = 120 pods.

We want to know how many cycles we can do with $1.  We know each cycle uses 1 pod, so we can divide the money we have by the cost per pod.  $1 / $0.12 per pod = 8.33 cycles.

So, you can do 8 cycles with the new box.

"Okay, so he starts with 1000 dollars, and he loses 10 bills.  So he has 990 left.  He uses half of that, which is 495.  Then he triples his money, so he has 1485.  He then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.  So he has 297 5 dollar bills.

"Okay, so team A scored 4 goals in the first half.  Team B scored 2 less than that, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals. 

In the second half, team A scored 1/4 of what team B scored, which is 4 * 1/4 = 1 goal.

Team B scored 4 times what they scored in the first half, so they scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

So, the total number of goals is 4 + 2 + 1 + 8 = 15.

"Okay, so the teacher used 45% of the chalk today.  He uses 20% each day, so he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.  

He used 2.25 times the amount of chalk today, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he has to use 2.25 times the amount of chalk each day.  

He needs to use 2.25 times the amount of chalk each day, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he has to use the chalk for 2.25 / 0.20 = 11.25 days. 

He has to use the chalk for 11.25 days.

"
"Okay, so we have 12 boys and 12 girls.  One-third of the girls is 12 / 3 = 4 girls.  One-fourth of the boys is 12 / 4 = 3 boys.  So, 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students are on varsity.  That means 12 - 7 = 5 students are not on varsity.

"Okay, so Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk and 2/5 of that was bad.  

First, we need to figure out how many gallons were bad. 

* 4000 gallons * (2/5) = 1600 gallons

Now we need to figure out how much he got back.

* 3.5 dollars per gallon * 1600 gallons = 5600 dollars

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of 5600 dollars.

"Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.  So, Wendy is 5 times older than Colin will be in 7 years. 

In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, Colin will be 1/3 as old as Wendy is now in 25 years.

Let's break it down:

* **Let Colin's current age be ""C""**
* **Wendy's current age is ""W""**

We know:

* **W = 5(C + 7)**  (Wendy is 5 times as old as Colin will be in 7 years)
* **W + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)** (Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now in 25 years)

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for C (Colin's current age). 

Let's solve the second equation for W:
* W + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)
* W + 25 = W/3 + 25/3
* 3W + 75 = W + 25
* 2W = -50
* W = -25

This doesn't make sense!  We can't have a negative age.  This means there's an error in the problem. 


**Final Answer:  There is no solution to this problem.**

"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **Start:** Two apples fall, one hits Newton's head.
* **First Toss:** Newton picks up two, puts one in his pocket, throws one back, 5 more fall.
* **Second Toss:** Newton picks up the new apples, puts most in his pocket, throws one, 6 more fall.
* **Final Toss:** Newton picks up all the apples.

So, he started with 2 apples, then 2 + 5 + 6 = 13 apples. 

**Answer:** 13 apples

"Okay, so Kate eats 6 cheese slices and 4 pepperoni slices.  We need to figure out how many pizzas she needs to buy. 

* Cheese pizza: 6 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 0.5 pizzas
* Pepperoni pizza: 4 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 0.5 pizzas

So, Kate needs to buy 0.5 pizzas for cheese and 0.5 pizzas for pepperoni. 

**Answer:** 1 pizza

"Okay, so Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 1 + 2 = 3 slices.  All together, they ate 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.

"Okay, so they used 38 bandages on the first day, and then they got more bandages.  They got one pack on the first day, and then they used 10 less bandages on the second day.  They got two packs on the third day, and only used half a pack.  They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.  How many bandages did they start with on the first day?

"May's hair is 2 inches long.  She got a haircut for 2 inches at $30 per inch, so it cost $60.  Then she got her hair colored for $40.  So, the total cost was $60 + $40 = $100.

"Okay, so Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, that's 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours a week. 

She makes $1.5 an hour, so she makes 45 * 1.5 = $67.50 a week.

And she gets an extra $10 for perfect attendance, so she makes $67.50 + $10 = $77.50 a week.

Now, April has 4 weeks, so she makes $77.50 * 4 = $310.00 for the month.

"Okay, so Jason did the dishwasher 6 times, laundry once, trash twice, and cleaned his room once.  Here's how much he earned:

* Dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50/time = $3.00
* Laundry: 1 time * $3.00/time = $3.00
* Trash: 2 times * $0.75/time = $1.50
* Cleaning: 1 time * $1.50/time = $1.50

Total: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

**Answer: $8.00**

"Okay, so a whale has 40 gallons of blood.  A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has 3 times 40 gallons, which is 120 gallons.  Now we have ten sharks, so we multiply 120 gallons per shark by 10 sharks, which is 1200 gallons. 

**1200** 
"
"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **Morning:** 50 people
* **10:00:** 40 more people came in, so 50 + 40 = 90 people
* **Lunch:** Twice the number from 10:00 came in, so 90 * 2 = 180 people
* **Evening:** 3 times the morning number came in, so 50 * 3 = 150 people

**Total:** 50 + 90 + 180 + 150 = **470 people**

"John buys 20 bottles of cognac.  Each bottle of cognac costs $600 / 10 bottles = $60.  So, the cognac costs 20 bottles * $60 = $1200.  John spends $600 + $1200 = $1800 on everything.

"Okay, so Mr. Julius planted White Oak trees.  He planted 20 of them.  He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.  On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.  He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees, so he planted 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees.  So he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.  So he planted 20 + 40 + 30 + 50 = 140 trees in total.

"Okay, so Fred had 24 gallons to start.  Then his kids drank 4, and Barbie spilled 7.  That leaves 24 - 4 - 7 = 13 gallons.  Ronnie took 5 more, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.  So, 8 gallons were left for the party.  If 3 people shared it, each person gets 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many mugs are in the teacher's lounge.  

Let's think about it like this:

* Let's say there are ""x"" coffee mugs in the lounge.
* Four times the number of mugs is 4x.
* Eight more than that is 4x + 8.
* We know this is equal to 40.

So, we have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

Now, let's solve for x:

* Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
* Divide both sides by 4: x = 8

So, there are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Okay, so we have 66 fish.  One-third of them have red stripes, so that's 66 / 3 = 22 fish.  

The rest of the fish don't have red stripes, so we have 66 - 22 = 44 fish left.

Then 5/11 of the rest have blue stripes, so that's (5/11) * 44 = 20 fish.

So, 22 fish have red stripes and 20 fish have blue stripes.

"Okay, so Amy has 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.  And she has 6 colors from the makeup sets.  She uses up half of the colors from one set, so she has 3 colors left.  She has 8 + 6 - 3 = 11 eyeshadow colors left.

"Okay, so Mattisen is 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times taller, so it's 7 * 60 = 420 inches tall.  The first floor is 3 times Mattisen's height, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 inches high.  The roof is the top of the house, so it's 420 - 180 = 240 inches high.

"Okay, so we know the Alphas found 40% of the shells.  That means 60% of the shells are left over.  The finders found 60% of the shells that were left over.  So, we need to figure out how many shells were left over.  

Let's say the total number of shells is 100.  

* Alphas found 40% of the shells, so they found 40/100 * 100 = 40 shells.
* The finders found 60% of the shells that were left over, so they found 60/100 * (100 - 40) = 60 * 60 = 360 shells.
* The total number of shells found is 40 + 360 = 400 shells.
* The Gogetters found the rest of the shells, so they found 100 - 400 = -300 shells.

"Okay, so Bernie's dogs need to walk a total of 3 miles a day.  The first dog walks 1 mile, the second walks 4 miles, and the third walks 3 miles.

"Okay, so his house is worth 250,000 dollars.  He gets a loan for 40% of that, which is 250,000 * 0.40 = 100,000 dollars.  Then he uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  That's 100,000 * 0.60 = 60,000 dollars.  So he has 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 dollars left. 

**40,000**

"Okay, so Deandre caught three tunas.  The first one is 56 kilos, the second is 46 kilos, and the last one is 26 kilos.  He sells them all for $0.50 a kilo.  So, he sells 3 tunas * $0.50 a kilo = $1.50. 

**Answer:** $1.50

"Trinity sells the magazines for 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, she sells them for 11/8 * $72 = $99.  She makes a profit of $99 - $72 = $27.

"Okay, so the low setting takes 1 liter a day.  The medium setting takes twice that, so it takes 1 * 2 = 2 liters a day.  The high setting takes twice the medium setting, so it takes 2 * 2 = 4 liters a day.

Here's how we can add up the water removed:

* Low setting: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* Medium setting: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* High setting: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Total: 3 + 6 + 20 = **29 liters**

"Okay, so Jolene and her friends got 10 packs of balloons.  Each pack has 30 balloons, so they got 10 * 30 = 300 balloons.  They threw 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.

"Okay, so Saanvi needs 14 mL of medicine one and 3 times that, so 14 * 3 = 42 mL.  

Now, if she needs 42 mL for one dose, then for 8 doses she needs 42 * 8 = 336 mL.

"Okay, so Ali's class is big, 120 students.  John's class is smaller, only 1/8 the size, so 120 / 8 = 15 students.  John has two classes, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 students.  Ali's class is 120 and John's class is 30, so together they have 120 + 30 = 150 students.

"Okay, so my sister gave me $300.  I gotta pay her back with some extra money, like 2% extra.  So I'll pay her $300 plus 2% of $300.  That's like 6 dollars.  I'll pay her $300 plus 6 dollars.  That's $306.  I'll pay her $25 a month for 11 months, so that's $275.  So I'll pay her $306 plus $275.  That's $581.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many jelly beans are in the jar.  First, we gotta figure out the volume of the jar.  It's a square, so we can just multiply the sides: 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches.  Then we add the height: 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Now, we gotta figure out how many jelly beans are in the jar.  We know the volume of a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches, so we can divide the total volume of the jar by the volume of a jelly bean: 540 cubic inches / .15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 3600 jelly beans.

Now, we gotta figure out how many jelly beans are red.  We know 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 30%: 3600 jelly beans * .30 = 1080 red jelly beans.

Now we gotta figure out how far off his guess was.  We know the true number of red jelly beans is 900, and he guessed 1080.  So, he was 1080 - 900 = 180 jelly beans off.

**Answer:** 180

"Okay, so the bus started with 20 people. Then it got 40 more people on the first stop.  Then, on the second stop, 3/4 of the people from the first stop got on the bus.  So, we need to figure out how many people got on the bus at the second stop. 

Let's do the math:

* **People on the second stop:** (3/4) * 40 people = 30 people

Now, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 people.

The bus needs to be full, so we need to figure out how many more people to get on.

* **People needed to fill the bus:** 200 people - 90 people = 110 people

So, the answer is 110. 



**110**

"Okay, so the museum is my favorite!  I go there a lot.  

First, I need to figure out how much it costs now.  The price went up 150%, so it's like the price doubled.  So, the new price is $2 * 2 = $4.

Now, I go to the museum for 3 more years.  That's 5 years + 3 years = 8 years.

So, I go to the museum 8 times.  That's 3 times a year * 8 years = 24 visits.

The total cost is 24 visits * $4 per visit = $96.

"Okay, so we have 10 students in each grade, and only 8 can go at a time.  We need to figure out how many groups of 8 we can make.  

We have 10 students in each grade, so we have 3 grades * 10 students/grade = 30 students.

We can fit 8 students in a group, so we can make 30 students / 8 students/group = 3.75 groups.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can make 3 groups.

Each group gets 45 minutes, so it will take 3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes.

* He makes 16 meatballs per pound of meat.
* He wants 80 meatballs.

So, I need to figure out how many pounds of meat I need to make 80 meatballs. 

* 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat.

Now, I know he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat.

* 5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

"Okay, so you gotta pay for the first 16 minutes at $0.25 a minute, right?  That's 16 * 0.25 = $4.00.  Then you gotta pay for the rest of the call at $0.2 a minute for 20 minutes. That's 20 * 0.2 = $4.00.  So, the total cost is $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

"Okay, so Carly made brownies and cupcakes.  I know that she made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.  

Let's think about it like this:

* Let's say Carly made 'x' number of cupcakes.
* Three times the number of cupcakes is 3x.
* Two less than three times the number of cupcakes is 3x - 2.
* Carly made brownies, and we know she made 3x - 2 brownies.

Now, we know that each person gets 2 treats.  So, we can figure out how many people got treats.

* 5 people got treats.
* 5 people got 2 treats each.
* 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

We know that Carly made brownies and cupcakes, and each person got 2 treats.  We can figure out how many cupcakes she made.

* 10 treats / 2 treats/cupcake = 5 cupcakes.

So, Carly made 5 cupcakes.

"Okay, so the manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40.  That's $35 + $40 = $75.  Then, nail art is $3 per nail, so that's $3 * 10 nails = $30.  So Karen would pay $75 + $30 = $105.

"Okay, so the toy was $40 in November.  Then it went up 80% so it was $40 * 1.80 = $72.  Then it went down 50% so it was $72 * 0.50 = $36.  So the price was $36.

"Okay, so Charlie is a tennis pro.  He charges $80 an hour for lessons.  He gives some lessons to veterans, and he gives them a discount.  I think I can figure this out.

* **Standard lessons:** 4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320
* **Veteran lessons:** 2 lessons * $80/lesson * 0.75 (25% discount) = $120
* **Total:** $320 + $120 = $440

So Charlie will make $440 for the day.

"Okay, so we gotta add all the scores up, then divide by how many scores there are. 

50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 560
 
560 / 9 = 62.22

"Okay, so Walter had 60 apples. He ate 2/5, which is like, half, right? So he had 60 / 2 = 30 apples left. 

Then he gave his sister 25% of the rest, which is like, a quarter of the apples. So he gave her 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 apples.

Now he has 30 - 7.5 = 22.5 apples left.

He sold them to his uncle for $3 each, so he made 22.5 * 3 = $67.50. 

**Answer: $67.50** 
"
"Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  She wrote 9 novels last year, and that is 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year.  So, she wrote 9 * 3 = 27 novels this year.

"Okay, so Michael is driving 50 km per hour.  He's going for 3 days.  That's 50 km per hour * 24 hours per day * 3 days = 3600 km.  

Now we need to figure out what percentage of 6000 km that is.  

3600 km / 6000 km = 0.6.

0.6 times 100% = 60%.

So Michael has covered 60% of the distance.

"Okay, so Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times that many, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.  Then, they had 30 grapes left.  The mother used 4 pies, so she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.  So, there were 30 + 48 = 78 grapes at the beginning.

"Okay, so Bud buys cheese for his mac and cheese.  He buys cheddar for $3.00 and gruyere for twice that, so he spends $3.00 * 2 = $6.00 on gruyere.  That's $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00 for cheese.  He buys a box of pasta for $1.00.  He makes mac and cheese once a week, so in a year, he makes it 52 times.  So, he spends $9.00 * 52 = $468.00 on cheese in a year.

"Okay, so we got 80 classrooms, and each one takes 15 minutes to clean.  That's a lot of cleaning! 

We need to figure out how many minutes they spend cleaning in total.  

First, we need to figure out how many minutes they work each day.  They work 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

Now, we can figure out how many classrooms they clean in a day.  They clean 80 classrooms in 480 minutes.

Now, we can figure out the percentage of their day they spend cleaning.  

**Answer:** 100% 


"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many books are on each shelf. 

* Bottom shelf: Twice as many as a middle shelf, so it holds 10 * 2 = 20 books.
* Top shelf: 5 fewer than the bottom shelf, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's figure out how many shelves we need. 

* Total books on the shelves: 10 * 2 + 20 + 15 = 50 books.
* We have 110 books, so we need 110 / 50 = 2 bookcases.

**Answer:** 2 
"
"Okay, so Rose got 60 eggs.  She sells them in groups of 3.  So she has 60 / 3 = 20 groups of eggs.  That means she will make 20 * $1 = $20.  She spent $2.40 * 5 = $12 on the eggs.  Her profit is $20 - $12 = $8.

"Okay, so half the hats are red, that's 100 / 2 = 50 hats.  Then, we have 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.  Of those, 3/5 are blue, so 50 * (3/5) = 30 hats are blue.  That leaves 50 - 30 = 20 hats, which are white. 

So Skyler has **20** white hats. 


"
"Okay, so Archie gets 30 sticks in a bag and it costs $18.00.  If it's $3.00 off, that means it's $15.00 now.  So, we need to figure out how much each stick costs.  

First, we divide the total cost by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.

Now, we need to convert that to cents: $0.50 x 100 cents = 50 cents.

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

So, she needs to get 70% of 40 questions right on the second test.

* 70% of 40 questions is 28 questions. 


**Answer: 28** 
"
"Okay, so we know Mary made 116 ice cubes total.  She made strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes.  Let's figure out how many strawberry cubes she made. 

Let's say she made 'x' strawberry cubes.  

Blueberry cubes are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  So, that's 5x - 4.

We know the total is 116, so: 
x + (5x - 4) = 116

Now we can solve for x:
6x - 4 = 116
6x = 120
x = 20

So, Mary made 20 strawberry cubes.

Now we can find the number of blueberry cubes:
5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

Mary made **96** blueberry cubes.

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many candles and flashlights they have. 

* **Flashlights:**  They have one flashlight for each person, so 4 people need flashlights.
* **Candles:**  They have 4 small candles for half the rooms, so 4 rooms / 2 = 2 rooms.  They have 4 small candles for each of those 2 rooms.
* **Total Candles:** They have 4 small candles for 2 rooms, so 4 * 2 = 8 small candles.
* **Total Candles:** They have 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms, so 4 rooms / 2 = 2 rooms. They have 5 medium candles for each of those 2 rooms.
* **Total Candles:** They have 5 * 2 = 10 medium candles.
* **Total Candles:** They have 8 small candles + 10 medium candles = 18 candles.
* **Total Flashlights:** They have 4 flashlights.

**Answer:** 4 flashlights + 18 candles

"Okay, so it takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side.  The second and third sides take twice as long, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.  The last two sides take half as long as the first, so that's 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.  So, the total time is 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.

"Okay, so Tim works 6 hours a day, and each call takes 15 minutes.  That's a lot of calls!  

Here's how to figure it out:

* **Hours to minutes:** 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes
* **Calls per day:** 360 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 24 calls
* **Calls in a week:** 24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls

**Answer:** 120 calls 
"
"Okay, so Louise is painting six paintings.  

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry, and the old varnish takes 7 minutes.  

So, the new varnish takes 12 - 7 = 5 minutes longer to dry.

If we multiply that by 6 paintings, it's 5 minutes * 6 = 30 minutes.

**Answer: 30 minutes** 
"
"Okay, so Crista has 20 plants.  Four plants need half a cup, and eight need a cup.  That's 4 * 0.5 + 8 * 1 = 12 cups.  The rest need a quarter cup, and there are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants that need a quarter cup.  So, 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.  That's a total of 12 + 2 = 14 cups of water Crista needs every day. 

**14**

"Okay, so Phineas has to hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in water.  

* Hops: 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes
* Swims: 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

So, it will take Phineas 5 minutes to hop and 10 minutes to swim.  That's a total of 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

"
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, and each box has 8 sticks. So, he needs 56 / 8 = 7 boxes.  Each box costs $2.00, so 7 boxes cost 7 * $2.00 = $14.00. 

**$14.00**

"Okay, so John's speed is 150 words per minute.  He's going to be talking 2.5 times faster, so he's talking 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

He's got 10 pages, and each page has 450 words, so he's got 10 * 450 = 4500 words to say.

To figure out how long it takes him, we divide the total words by his speaking speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **Day 2:** Conor saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
* **Day 3:**  He saw 70 * 2 = 140 people.
* **Rest of the week:** He saw 60 people each day for 5 days, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 people.
* **Total:**  50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 560 people

"Okay, so the popcorn is popping real fast!  Let's see...

* First, 20 kernels pop in 30 seconds.
* Then, 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop in the next 30 seconds.
* Then, 60 * 4 = 240 kernels pop in the next 30 seconds.
* Then, 240 / 2 = 120 kernels pop in the last 30 seconds.
* After the heat is off, 120 / 4 = 30 kernels pop from the heat.

So, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 + 30 = **450** kernels of popcorn to eat.

"Okay, so we got 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs.  They eat a lot of food! 

* German Shepherds eat 5 kg each day.
* Bulldogs eat 3 kg each day.

So, we need to add up their food. 

* 3 German Shepherds * 5 kg/Shepherd = 15 kg
* 2 Bulldogs * 3 kg/Bulldog = 6 kg

That's 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg of dog food a day.

Now, we need to figure out how much they eat in a week.

* 21 kg/day * 7 days/week = 147 kg

They need 147 kg of dog food in a week.

"
"Okay, so the boat cost $9000.  First year it lost 30% so it's worth $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 less.  So now it's worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.  The second year it lost another 30% so it's worth $6300 * 0.30 = $1890 less.  So now it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.  The third year it lost 20% so it's worth $4410 * 0.20 = $882 less.  So now it's worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"Okay, so we know there are 54 red candies.  Twice that many orange candies is 54 * 2 = 108.  Half as many yellow candies as red is 54 / 2 = 27.  So, we have 108 orange candies and 27 yellow candies.  That's a total of 108 + 27 = 135 candies.  We have 232 total candies, so we have 232 - 135 = 97 pink candies.

"Okay, so Frances sells cupcakes and cookies.  She sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so that's 20 * 2 = $40.  She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, so that's 40 * 1 = $40.  She buys five trays for $4 each, so that's 5 * 4 = $20.  So, she has $40 + $40 + $20 = $100.  She starts with $100 and buys $20 worth of trays.  So, she has $100 - $20 = $80 left.

"Okay, so we start with 5 kids.  Then each kid gets another kid on the second street, so now we got 5 + 1 = 6 kids.  Then on the third street, each kid gets 2 more, so we got 6 + 2 = 8 kids.  Then the original 5 kids give up, so we got 8 - 5 = 3 kids.

"Mamou has 1,360 - 64 - 30 - 48 = **1,168** meals left to distribute. 


"
"Okay, so we got a quarter, two nickels, and seven dimes.  A quarter is 25 cents, two nickels are 10 cents each, and seven dimes are 7 * 10 = 70 cents.  So, that's 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.

"Okay, so we got 2 brothers and 3 sisters.  The sisters are all the same age, which is 16.  The older brother is 12, which is half the age of the other brother.  So the other brother is 12 * 2 = 24.  The total age of all the siblings is 12 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 50.

"Okay, so Charisma meditates 15 minutes every day, and that's 15 minutes a day, right?  And she does yoga for an hour, 5 days a week.  So, that's 1 hour a day, 5 days a week, which is 5 hours a week.  

Now, we need to figure out how many weeks are in 4 weeks.  So, 4 weeks is 4 times 1 week.  

Now, we need to add up the time she spends meditating and doing yoga.  That's 15 minutes a day * 15 days = 225 minutes.  And that's 225 minutes.  And that's 225 minutes.  And that's 225 minutes.

"Okay, so we gotta add up the square footage of all the shirts! 

* Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
* Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
* Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add all that up: 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet

So the quilt is 101 square feet.

"Okay, so a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.  A dozen is 12, so that's 3 times 12, which is 36 seeds.  A big sunflower has 36 seeds times 1.5, which is 54 seeds.  So, together they have 36 + 54 = 90 seeds. 

**90** 
"
"Timothy has three times the number of pens George owns, so Timothy has 3 * 18 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so Sarah has 54 / 2 = 27 pens. 

**27** 
"
"Anne is twice as tall as Albert, so Anne is 36 * 2 = 72"" tall. Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72 - 2 = 70"" tall.  

Jackie was 70"" tall before summer.

"
"Okay, so we got 5000 bars a day, and each bar is $2.  Two weeks is 14 days.  So, we do 5000 bars a day * 14 days = 70,000 bars.  That's a lot of chocolate!  We sell each bar for $2, so we make 70,000 bars * $2 a bar = $140,000.  


**$140,000** 
"
"Okay, so Jake gets two T-shirts for 50% off, so each T-shirt is $8 * 0.50 = $4.  That means he pays $8 * 0.50 = $4 for each T-shirt.  Then he buys shoes that are 40% off, so the shoes are $40 * 0.40 = $16 off.  The shoes are $40 - $16 = $24.  So Jake spends $4 * 2 = $8 for the T-shirts and $24 for the shoes.  That makes a total of $8 + $24 = $32. 

**32** 
"
"Okay, so Ryan gets $6 a week for chores. He did chores for 3 weeks, so he has $6 * 3 = $18.  Then he buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so that's $1.25 * 4 = $5.  He has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  The movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 movie tickets.

"
"Okay, so Ellen got leggings for $100 and a picture frame for $5. Lani got sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each.  That's $30 + (2 * $100) = $30 + $200 = $230. Ellen and Lani spent $100 + $5 + $230 = $335 in all.

"Okay, so I gotta figure out how much it costs to make 10 jars. 

* Passion fruit: 10 jars * 2 pounds/jar = 20 pounds
* Jackfruit: 10 jars * 1.5 pounds/jar = 15 pounds
* Honey: 10 jars * 2 pounds/jar = 20 pounds

Now, let's see how much it costs:

* Passion fruit: 20 pounds * $6/pound = $120
* Jackfruit: 15 pounds * $8/pound = $120
* Honey: 20 pounds * $10/pound = $200

Total cost: $120 + $120 + $200 = $440

Now, let's see how much he makes:

* Selling price: 10 jars * $50/jar = $500

Profit: $500 - $440 = $60

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars.

"Okay, so we got quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.  We need to figure out how much all of them are worth. 

* Quarters are worth 25 cents each.
* Dimes are worth 10 cents each.
* Nickels are worth 5 cents each.
* Pennies are worth 1 cent each.

So, we need to add up all the coins and multiply by their value. 

* Quarters: 32 * 25 = 800 cents
* Dimes: 95 * 10 = 950 cents
* Nickels: 120 * 5 = 600 cents
* Pennies: 750 * 1 = 750 cents

Now, we add all those up: 800 + 950 + 600 + 750 = 2200 cents.

That's a lot of money!

"Okay, so Janet buys ice cream, movie tickets, and a bracelet.  That's $3.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $19.50.  She has $40 from her parents.  So, she has $40 - $19.50 = $20.50 left.

"Okay, so Josh works 6 days a week, right?  He gets paid 4 dollars per car.  So, he does 3 cars a day, times 6 days a week, that's 18 cars a week.  So, he makes 18 cars times 4 dollars a car, that's 72 dollars a week.  In two weeks, he makes 72 dollars a week times 2 weeks, that's 144 dollars.

"Okay, so Randy started with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies. He ate some, but I don't know how many.  He gave some to his friends, but I don't know how many.  He baked more cookies, but I don't know how many. 

I need more information to figure out how many cookies he has now. 


 
"
"Okay, so Matthew has 12 toys.  Half of them are worth $5 each, and the other half are worth $7 each.  He'd make 6 toys at $5 each, and 6 toys at $7 each.  That's $30 for the $5 toys and $42 for the $7 toys.  So, he'd make $30 + $42 = $72.

"Okay, so Norman High School has 4000 students.  Butler High School has 3/4 of that, which is like 3/4 times 4000.  That's 3 times 1000, which is 3000.  So, Norman High School has 4000 students and Butler High School has 3000.  The difference is 4000 - 3000 = 1000.

"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **Test tubes:** Igor got half the number of test tubes asked for, so he got 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** Igor got 2 more than the number of Petri dishes asked for, so he got 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total items:** Igor had 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.
* **Beakers:** We know he had 29 items total, and he had 24 items already, so he lost 29 - 24 = 5 beakers.

**Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers.

"James needs 16 screws.  He has 40 screws and each leg needs 2 screws, so he needs 4 tables * 4 legs/table * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws.  He will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

"Okay, so we know the total number of animals is 20 and the total legs are 70.  We need to figure out how many are chickens. 

Here's how we can do it:

* **Let's think about chickens and cows:**  Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs.
* **We know the total legs:** 70
* **Let's use variables:** Let 'c' be the number of chickens and 'w' be the number of cows.
* **Set up equations:** 
    * c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
    * 2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for 'c'. 

* **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
   c = 20 - w

* **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

* **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

* **Now that we know 'w', we can find 'c':**
   c = 20 - w
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Answer:** There are **5** chickens on the farm.

Now we gotta divide that by the number of people: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

**14**
