**Understanding the Ratio:**

The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

**Setting up the Equation:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water used.

The ratio can be expressed as: 7/13 = 120 teaspoons / x cups

**Solving for x:**

1. Cross-multiply: 7 * x = 13 * 120
2. Simplify: 7x = 1560
3. Divide both sides by 7: x = 222.86 cups (approximately)

**Finding the Number of Teaspoonfuls of Sugar:**

* We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
* The ratio is 7:13, meaning for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

**Final Answer:**

Since we know the ratio is 7:13, we can calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying the number of cups of water used by the ratio. 

* 222.86 cups * 13 = 2899.86 teaspoons 

**Therefore, Katy used approximately 2899.86 teaspoons of sugar.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of blue jelly beans.**

* **Red jelly beans:** The jar has 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so there are 0.9x red jelly beans.

* **Green jelly beans:** The jar has 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so there are 1.01x green jelly beans.

* **Total jelly beans:**  The total number of jelly beans is x + 0.9x + 1.01x = 2.91x

* **We know the total is 4500:** 2.91x = 4500

* **Solve for x:** x = 4500 / 2.91

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 's' represent the number of sheep.**
* **Let 'g' represent the number of geese.**

We know:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

Now we can solve this system of equations.  Here's one way to do it:

1. **Solve for 's' in the second equation:** 
   s = 20 - g

2. **Substitute this value of 's' into the first equation:**
   4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'g':**
   80 - 4g + 2g = 70
   -2g = -10
   g = 5

4. **Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g:**
   s = 20 - 5
   s = 15

**Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.**

* **Extending the dress by 50% means adding 0.50x to the original length.**

"Here's how to calculate the price of the crate:

* **Banana price:** One apple costs $0.50, and bananas cost twice as much, so a banana costs $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.
* **Orange price:** Oranges are three times more expensive than bananas, so they cost $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
* **Total cost:**  The crate has 5 bananas at $1.00 each, 12 apples at $0.50 each, and 7 oranges at $3.00 each.  
    * Total cost = (5 * $1.00) + (12 * $0.50) + (7 * $3.00) = $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00

**Therefore, the price for the crate of fruit would be $32.00.**

"Here's how to break down the problem to find the missing points:

* **Betty's points:** Betty collected 30% more than Adam, so she collected 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 65 points.
* **Marta's points:** Marta collected 3 times more than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty.  So, Marta collected 3 * (65 - 30) = 135 points.
* **Total points:**  The class needs 400 points to go on the trip.
* **Points collected by the class:** Adam (50) + Betty (65) + Marta (135) = 250 points.
* **Missing points:** 400 - 250 = 150 points.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Dora's father's age:** Let's represent Dora's age as ""D"".  Her father's age is ""2D + 8"" (twice Dora's age plus 8).
* **Dora's mother's age:** Her mother is 4 years younger than Dora's father, so she is ""2D + 8 - 4"" or ""2D + 4"".
* **Total combined age:**  The total combined age is D + (2D + 8) + (2D + 4) = 5D + 12

Now, we know Dora is 15 years old, so:

* 5D + 12 = 15 + 15

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the driving speed:**

* The Llesis family drove at 50 miles per hour.

**2. Calculate the hiking speed:**

* Half their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  x = fragrance (same amount as zest)
    *  y = salt (same amount as sugar)
    *  z = 2y (twice as much oil as salt)
    *  z = 2x (twice as much salt as zest)

* **We know the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces:**
    *  x + y + z + fragrance = 10 ounces

* **Substitute the known values:**
    *  x + y + 2y + x = 10 ounces

* **We know that x = y:**
    *  2x + 3x = 10 ounces

* **A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning its speed is 11x.**
* **We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so 11x = 121 meters per second.**
* **Solve for x: x = 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.**
* **The whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob, so its speed is 5 * 11 meters per second = 55 meters per second.**

**Therefore, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Dinar's score be represented by 'x'
    * Bahati's score is 'x + 20'
    * Azibo's score is 'x + 30'

* **Set up an equation:** The total points for the team is 45, so:
    * x + (x + 20) + (x + 30) = 45

* **Solve for x:**
    * 3x + 50 = 45
    * 3x = -5
    * x = -5/3 

* **Since we can't have a negative score, there must be an error in the problem setup.**  It's impossible for Bahati to score 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar if the total points are 45.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips the other two people received.**
* **The person who received 15 more chips got x + 15.**
* **The total number of chips for the two people who got the same amount is 2x.**
* **The total number of chips for the other two people is 2x + 15.**
* **The total number of chips is the sum of the two groups.**
* **Therefore, 2x + 2x + 15 = 70**
* **Combining like terms, 4x + 15 = 70**
* **Subtracting 15 from both sides, 4x = 55**
* **Dividing both sides by 4, x = 13.75**

**Since we can't have a fraction of a corn chip, we need to adjust our thinking.**

**Let's re-examine the problem:**

* **The problem states that only two people get an equal amount of chips.** This means the number of chips each person gets is a whole number. 
* **The person who received 15 more chips got x + 15.** This means they received a whole number of chips.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    * Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    * Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the first equation (A = S + 5) into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Simplify: 2S + W = 334
    * Substitute the second equation (S = 4W - 13) into the simplified equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 334
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 334
    * Combine like terms: 9W = 360
    * Solve for W: W = 40 

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W (40) back into the second equation: S = 4(40) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 160 - 13
    * Solve for S: S = 147

**Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so her howl lasts 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* **Combined howl time:**  Tobias' howl is 20 seconds, and Chikote's is 40 seconds, so their combined howl time is 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous' howl:** Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so his howl lasts 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time of all three wolves' howls is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Conversion to minutes:** There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the total howl time is 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.

2. **Find Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.

3. **Set up an equation:** We know the total age is 20, so (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20.

4. **Substitute known values:** We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.  We can substitute these values into the equation to get (3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) = 20.

5. **Solve for Helene's age:**  We can simplify the equation to 7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20.  

6. **Solve for Wilfred's age:**  We can solve for Helene's age by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation.  This gives us Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 13.

7. **Find the age of Wilfred:**  We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Wilfred's age + Helene's age) / 4.  We can substitute the value of Helene's age from step 6 into this equation.

8. **Calculate the age of Wilfred:**  We can solve for Wilfred's age by substituting the value of Helene's age into the equation.


**Note:**  The provided information is insufficient to calculate the exact age of Wilfred.

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.** 
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, meaning it had 95% of its capacity after 5 hours.
   - We can express this as: 100% - 9% = 91%
   - The power bank had 91% of its capacity after 5 hours.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge after 5 hours.**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours.
   - We can express this as: 100% - 7% = 93%
   - The power bank had 93% of its capacity after 3 hours.

* **Step 3: Calculate the initial charge.**
   - The power bank had 28% of its capacity at the end.
   - We can express this as: 100% - 28% = 72%
   - The power bank had 72% of its capacity after 8 hours.

**Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank was 100%.**

* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:** C + 25 = (W + 25)/3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

**1. Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**

Since we know W = 5(C + 7), we can substitute that into the second equation:
C + 25 = (5(C + 7) + 25)/3

**2. Simplify and solve for C:**

* C + 25 = (5C + 35 + 25)/3
* C + 25 = (5C + 60)/3
* 3C + 75 = 5C + 60
* 15 = 2C
* C = 7.5

**Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
    *  Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  t = p + 2  (Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes)
    *  t = 16/2 = 8 (Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested)
    *  p = 14 (Igor gathered the correct number of beakers)
    *  Total items = t + p + 8 = 29

* **Solve for the number of beakers Igor lost:**
    *  Substitute the value of 't' from the first equation into the third equation: 8 + 14 + 8 = 29
    *  This equation is not consistent with the given information. 

**Conclusion:** There is an inconsistency in the given information. It's impossible to have the given number of items with the given number of beakers.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Vanessa's speed:** Vanessa ran 4 miles, and since she ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran 2 miles.
* **Aaron's speed:** Aaron ran 16 minutes for 2 miles, so his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.
* **Vanessa's speed:** Vanessa's speed is 4 miles / Vanessa's time. 
* **Vanessa's time:**  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.  

Let's plug in the values:

Vanessa's time = 4 miles / (0.125 miles/minute) = 32 minutes.

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:** 
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.**
