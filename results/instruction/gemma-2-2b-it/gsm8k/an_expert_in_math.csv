"Let 'x' represent the number of copies Harald sold.  Since Marilyn sold 10 times as many as Harald, Marilyn sold 10x copies.  

The total number of copies sold is the sum of Harald's and Marilyn's sales: x + 10x = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get 11x = 88,000

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'q' represent the number of queens.**
* **Baby bees are twice the number of queens, so there are 2q baby bees.**
* **Worker bees are twice the number of baby bees, so there are 2 * 2q = 4q worker bees.**

Now we know:

* **Total bees = worker bees + baby bees + queens**
* **700 = 4q + 2q + q**

Combine like terms:

* **700 = 7q**

Solve for q:

* **q = 700 / 7 = 100**

Now that we know the number of queens (q = 100), we can find the number of worker bees:

* **Worker bees = 4q = 4 * 100 = 400**

**Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.**

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Seagull's snack:** The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, so he ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* **Pigeons' feast:** Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, totaling 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* **Remaining fries:** After the pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = 8 fries left.
* **Raccoon's grab:** The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 8 = 5.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 5.
* **Final count:**  The ants took one fry, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 fries.

**Therefore, there were 7 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.**

"Here's how to calculate the price increase:

* **Calculate the monthly increase:** 20% of $20 is (20/100) * $20 = $4.
* **Calculate the price after each increase:** 
    * Month 1: $20 + $4 = $24
    * Month 2: $24 + $4 = $28
    * Month 3: $28 + $4 = $32
    * ... and so on
* **Calculate the total price after 36 months:**  This requires a bit of a pattern recognition approach.  

**Important Note:**  The pattern is a geometric sequence where the price increases by a constant factor each time. 

**To find the final price, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:**

* a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1) 
   * a_n = the nth term (the price after n months)
   * a_1 = the first term (the initial price)
   * r = the common ratio (the constant factor of increase)
   * n = the number of terms (the number of months)

**In this case:**

* a_1 = $20
* r = 1.20 (since the price increases by 20% each time)
* n = 36

**Therefore, the final price after 36 months is:**

$20 * (1.20)^36 

**Calculating this using a calculator, the final price after 36 months is approximately $100.80.**

1.  s + s + 2 + b + b + 2 = 28
2.  2s + 2b + 4 = 28
3.  2s + 2b = 24
4.  s + b = 12  (Divide both sides by 2)

We can substitute 's = 2b' from the first equation into the second equation:

1.  2(2b) + 2b = 24
2.  4b + 2b = 24
3.  6b = 24
4.  b = 4  (Divide both sides by 6)

Now that we know Brooke's age (b = 4), we can find Seth's age:

1.  s = 2b
2.  s = 2 * 4
3.  s = 8

**Therefore, Seth is 8 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem using variables:

* Let Ruby's current age be represented by ""R""
* Let Sam's current age be represented by ""S""

We're given the following information:

* **R = 6S** (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **R + 9 = 3(S + 9)** (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for Sam's current age (S):

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.**
* **Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight in a different timeframe.**
* **To find the time Sandy needs, we can set up a proportion:**  
   (Weight Sandy loses) / (Time Sandy takes) = (Weight Joey loses) / (Time Joey takes)

* **Let 'x' represent the number of weeks Sandy needs.**
* **We know:**
    * (Weight Sandy loses) / x = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
    * (Weight Sandy loses) / x = 2 pounds/week

* **Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can set up the equation:**
    * 2 pounds/week = 8 pounds / x

* **Solve for x:**
    * Multiply both sides by x: 2x = 8
    * Divide both sides by 2: x = 4

**Answer:** It will take Sandy **4 weeks** to lose the same amount of weight.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Cera's age six years ago:** Cera is currently 46, so six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* **Noah's age six years ago:** Six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age, so he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* **Population of Chile six years ago:** The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
* **Current population of Chile:**  Since the population of Chile six years ago was 60,000, and the population has not changed, the current population is 60,000.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total Players:** The total number of players is the sum of the players on offense, defense, and special teams: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now, let's solve for x:**

1. Combine like terms: (3/2)x + x = 105
2. Find a common denominator: (3/2)x + (2/2)x = 105
3. Combine terms: (5/2)x = 105
4. Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 105 * (2/5)
5. Simplify: x = 42

**Therefore, there are 42 players on the defense.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Ratio:** The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.
* **Using the Ratio to Find the Poles:**  Let 'x' represent the number of poles. Since the ratio is 1:3, we know there are 3x wires.
* **Setting up the Equation:** We know the total number of wires is 45. So, we can write the equation: 1x + 3x = 45
* **Solving for x:** Combine like terms: 4x = 45
* **Finding the Number of Poles:** Divide both sides by 4: x = 11.25

**Since we can't have half a pole, we need to adjust our thinking.  The ratio is a ratio of poles to wires, not a ratio of poles to wires that can be a fraction.  The ratio is 1:3, meaning for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.  Therefore, the number of poles is 3 times the number of wires.  

* **Finding the Number of Poles:** 3 * 45 = 135

**Final Answer:** 135

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Define the events:**
    * Event A: A candle smells like wet dog.
    * Event B: A candle explodes.
* **We know:**
    * P(A|B) = 0.05 (5% of dangerous candles smell like wet dog)
    * P(B) = 0.01 (99% of candles don't explode)
* **We want to find:**
    * P(A and B) (the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog AND exploding)

**Understanding the Problem:**

The problem is about conditional probability. We need to find the probability of two events happening together, given that one of them is guaranteed to happen.

**Solution:**

Since we are given that 5% of dangerous candles smell like wet dog, and we know that 99% of candles don't explode, we can use the following logic:

* **P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)**

* **P(A) = 0.05** (5% of candles smell like wet dog)
* **P(B|A) = 0.01** (5% of dangerous candles smell like wet dog)

Therefore:

* **P(A and B) = 0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005**

**Answer:** 0.0005 or 0.05% of the candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

* Jeremy drives 400 miles per month.
* Each mile requires 725 rotations.
* Total rotations per month: 400 miles * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations

**2. Calculate the total rotations over a year:**

* Total rotations per year: 290,000 rotations/month * 12 months = 3,480,000 rotations

**3. Calculate the number of years:**

* Total rotations: 3,480,000 rotations
* Rotations per tire: 10,440,000 rotations
* Years to replace the tire: 3,480,000 rotations / 10,440,000 rotations/tire = 0.33 years

**4. Convert years to months:**

* 0.33 years * 12 months/year = 3.96 months

**Therefore, it will take approximately 3.96 months for the tire to need to be replaced.** 


**Final answer:** 3.96

    * Reggie's distance is 'R'

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  R = 5P  (Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran)
    *  R = P + 3 (Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn)
    *  P = 4 (Paisley ran 4 miles)

* **Solve for Lynn's distance (L):**
    * Substitute the value of P (4 miles) into the second equation: R = 4 + 3

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's break down the problem:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house.

    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  ""She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance""  =>  x = z
    *  ""She uses twice as much oil as salt"" => z = 2y
    *  ""She uses twice as much salt as zest"" => y = 2x

* **Solve for the amount of oil (z):**
    * Since x = z, we know z = x.
    * Substitute z = x into the equation z = 2y:  z = 2x
    * Substitute z = x into the equation z = 2y:  x = 2x
    * Simplify: 0 = x

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.
* The total number of cards is 341: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Now, let's solve for x:

* Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341
* Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Smendrick's cards:

* Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

Finally, we can find Becca's cards:

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let 'x' represent the number of books Fawn has.
* Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has 'x - 12' books.
* Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has 'x - 12 + 25' books, which simplifies to 'x + 13' books.

Now we know the total number of books is 85:
x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using variables to represent the unknown quantities:

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

* A + S + W = 339  (The total number of Pokemon caught)
* A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Now we can solve for Stan's catch:

1. **Substitute** the first equation (A = S + 5) into the second equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute** the third equation (S = 4W - 13) into the simplified equation:
   2S + W + 5 = 339
   2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339

4. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
   9W - 21 = 339
   9W = 360
   W = 40

5. **Substitute the value of W back into the third equation to find S:**
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

6. **Finally, substitute the value of S back into the first equation to find A:**
   A + 147 + W = 339
   A + 147 + 40 = 339
   A + 187 = 339
   A = 152

**Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.**

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial charge.** 
   * The power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours, meaning it had 95% of its capacity remaining after 5 hours.
   * Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank. 
   * We know that 95% of x is equal to 28% after 5 hours.
   *  Therefore, 0.95x = 0.28
   * Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.95 = 0.294 (approximately)

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal sells for 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding Proportional Pricing**

The key is that the prices are proportional. This means the number of sandwiches and the price are directly related.  We can find the price per sandwich for each package:

* **Package 1:** $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
* **Package 2:** $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

**Finding the Price of Package 3**

Since the prices are proportional, we can use the same relationship to find the price of package 3. 

* **Package 3:**  8 sandwiches /  (unknown price per sandwich) =  $1.50 per sandwich

**Solving for the Unknown**

To find the unknown price per sandwich, we can use the information from Package 2:

* $1.50 per sandwich = $6 / 4 sandwiches

To find the price of package 3, we can multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in package 3:

* $1.50 per sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $12

**Answer:** The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

* **Probability of no extension with normal teacher:** 60% (100% - 40%)
* **Probability of no extension and getting an extension:** 20% 
* **Probability of no extension and not getting an extension:** 40%

To find the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the possible scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Substitute teacher, no extension
* **Scenario 2:** Substitute teacher, extension
* **Scenario 3:** Normal teacher, no extension
* **Scenario 4:** Normal teacher, extension

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) = 4x - 28 centimeters long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + (x - 7) + (4x - 28) = 37

**Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 6x - 35 = 37
* Add 35 to both sides: 6x = 72
* Divide both sides by 6: x = 12

**Find the length of the red rope:**

The red rope is 4x - 28 centimeters long. Substitute x = 12:
4 * 12 - 28 = 48 - 28 = 20 centimeters

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the unknown:**  Let 'x' represent the number of pints of red, white, and purple paint.
* **Set up the equation:** Since the amounts of red, white, and purple are equal, we know: x = white = purple
* **Consider the yellow paint:** Half the mural is yellow, meaning it uses 1/2 * 12 pints = 6 pints of paint.
* **Solve for x:**  The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and we know 6 pints are yellow.  Therefore, the combined amount of red, white, and purple paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints.  Since x = white = purple, we have 3x = 6 pints.  
* **Find x:**  Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 2 pints.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be 'w'**
* **Let Colin's current age be 'c'**

We are given the following information:

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""**  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (w + 25)/3

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know w = 5(c + 7), we can substitute this into the second equation:
   c + 25 = (5(c + 7) + 25)/3

2. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   * c + 25 = (5c + 35 + 25)/3
   * c + 25 = (5c + 60)/3
   * 3(c + 25) = 5c + 60
   * 3c + 75 = 5c + 60
   * 15 = 2c
   * c = 7.5

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **Total animals:** c + w = 20
* **Total legs:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' using a system of equations:

1. **Solve for 'c' in the first equation:** 
   c = 20 - w

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   40 - 2w + 4w = 70
   2w = 30
   w = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
   c = 20 - 15
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**


**Answer: 5**
