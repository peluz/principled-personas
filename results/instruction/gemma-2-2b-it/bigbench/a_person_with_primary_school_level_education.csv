"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1.  Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 5:** The person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house.

* **Fred and Dave:** Fred gives Dave his black ball, and Dave gives Fred his green ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gives Bob his blue ball, and Bob gives Eve his orange ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives Fred his black ball, and Fred gives Claire her yellow ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gives Gertrude her orange ball, and Gertrude gives Bob her yellow ball.

"Let's think about who traded books and what they traded! 

* **Gertrude and Bob** traded books.  
* **Eve and Bob** traded books.
* **Bob and Dave** traded books.
* **Fred and Claire** traded books.
* **Claire and Alice** traded books.
* **Bob and Dave** traded books again.
* **Eve and Fred** traded books.

This means that Gertrude, Bob, Eve, Fred, and Claire all traded books with each other. 

We can figure out who has which book by looking at the list of books they got at the start of the semester.

"
"Here's how we can figure out what Dave has!

**Let's think about the swaps:**

* **Eve and Fred:**  They swap gifts, so Eve gets Fred's gift and Fred gets Eve's gift.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap gifts, so Dave gets Bob's gift and Bob gets Dave's gift.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap gifts, so Claire gets Gertrude's gift and Gertrude gets Claire's gift.
* **Fred and Claire:** They swap gifts, so Fred gets Claire's gift and Claire gets Fred's gift.
* **Bob and Fred:** They swap gifts, so Bob gets Fred's gift and Fred gets Bob's gift.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** They swap gifts, so Gertrude gets Alice's gift and Alice gets Gertrude's gift.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap gifts, so Bob gets Claire's gift and Claire gets Bob's gift.

**Now, let's look at the gifts:**

* **Dave** started with a green present.
* **Bob** started with a yellow present.
* **Claire** started with a purple present.
* **Fred** started with a pink ball.
* **Gertrude** started with a blue present.
* **Alice** started with a brown present.
* **Eve** started with a black ball.

**The only way Dave could end up with the green present is if he and Bob swapped gifts.**
