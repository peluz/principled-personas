"Here's how to figure out what Alice has at the end:

* **Alice starts with a white present.**
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts, so Alice gets Bob's present (blue) and Bob gets Alice's present (white).
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Alice now has Claire's present (yellow).
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice now has Bob's present (blue).

**So, Alice ends up with the blue present.** 

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Here's how to figure out what Bob has at the end:

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire gives Bob her present, and Bob gives Claire his present.  
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob gives Alice his present, and Alice gives Bob his present.

Since Bob started with an orange ball, and then swapped with Claire, and then with Alice, he must have the orange ball at the end.

* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Claire's ball.

So, the ball that Bob ends up with is the one he got from Claire in the last swap. 

**Answer: (C) blue ball.** 
"
"Here's how to figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they switch their balls.  
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They switch their balls again.

Since they swapped balls twice, we can figure out who has the ball at the end. 

**Answer:** Alice has the white ball. 
"
"Here's how to figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end:

* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** This means they swap places.
