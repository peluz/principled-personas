"Dave got the orange ball. 

Here's why:

* **Alice and Dave traded:**  They started with the orange and yellow balls.
* **Dave and Eve traded:**  Dave got the yellow ball from Eve.
* **Alice and Claire traded:**  Alice got the yellow ball from Dave.
* **Eve and Claire traded:**  Eve got the yellow ball from Claire.
* **Bob and Alice traded:**  Bob got the orange ball from Alice. 



Let me know if you want to play another game! 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of colors and we gotta figure out who got what! 

Bob and Alice swap, so now Bob has Alice's red present.  Then Dave and Eve swap, so Dave gets Eve's purple present.  Bob and Eve swap, so Bob gets Eve's purple present.  Dave and Bob swap, so Dave gets Bob's yellow present.  Finally, Claire and Alice swap, so Claire gets Alice's red present.

"Bob is playing right midfielder. 

Here's why:

* **Start:** Bob is right midfielder.
* **Claire and Eve trade:**  This doesn't change Bob's position.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob moves to Claire's spot.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob moves to Dave's spot.
* **Alice and Claire trade:**  Alice moves to Claire's spot.
* **Claire and Eve trade:** Eve moves to Claire's spot. 


Bob is always playing right midfielder. 
"
"Eve is dancing with **(C) Ophelia**. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Eve switch partners.**
* **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
* **Dave and Alice switch partners.**
* **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
* **Bob and Claire switch partners.** 

This means Eve and Bob switched partners, then Alice and Bob switched partners, then Dave and Alice switched partners, then Dave and Claire switched partners, and finally Bob and Claire switched partners. 


"
"Okay, so Claire and Bob switch partners, then Claire and Eve switch partners, then Claire and Bob switch partners again.  Then Eve and Dave switch partners.  So, Claire is dancing with Alice now.  Eve is dancing with Dave.  So the answer is (E). 
"

Eve is dancing with someone new at the end, so it's gotta be one of these people. 

Hmm... I think it's **(C) Melissa**. 


"
"Fred got the brown present. 

Here's why:

* **Fred and Bob swapped:** Fred got Bob's present.
* **Fred and Bob swapped:** Fred got Bob's present. 
* **Fred and Bob swapped:** Fred got Bob's present. 



 
"
"Fred is dancing with **(A) Sam**. 

Here's why:

* Fred and Alice switched partners first.
* Fred and Dave switched partners next.
* Fred and Gertrude switched partners after that. 
* Fred is the only one who has switched partners with everyone else. 



"
"Okay, so Gertrude and Eve switched partners.  Then Fred and Dave switched partners.  Then Alice and Bob switched partners.  Gertrude and Bob switched partners again.  Alice and Claire switched partners.  Dave and Alice switched partners.  Gertrude and Claire switched partners again. 

So, Eve is dancing with Melissa. 

The answer is (A). 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of dancers and they're all switchin' partners.  

Bob and Gertrude switch partners, then Bob and Fred switch partners.  Bob is a good dancer, so he's probably gonna be with someone good.  

So the answer is probably **(D) Melissa**. 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of presents and people swap them.  

Gertrude got a black ball from Eve, then Eve got a black ball from Gertrude.  So Gertrude has the black ball. 

The answer is (C). 
"
"Fred is playing **(D) left midfielder**. 

Here's why:

* Fred and Eve traded positions first.
* Eve and Claire traded positions.
* Gertrude and Alice traded positions.
* Dave and Bob traded positions.
* Claire and Alice traded positions.
* Bob and Alice traded positions.
* Gertrude and Eve traded positions.

* **Dave started with The Fellowship of the Ring.**  
* **He then traded with Fred.**
* **Fred traded with Dave.** 

So Dave got the book he traded with Fred. 
"
"Claire got The Pearl. 

Here's why:

* **Claire started with The Pearl.**  She got it first.
* **She traded with Fred.** Fred got The Pearl.
* **She traded with Dave.** Dave got Moby Dick.
* **She traded with Bob.** Bob got The Odyssey.
* **She traded with Eve.** Eve got Frankenstein.
* **She traded with Alice.** Alice got Ulysses. 


So, Claire got The Pearl. 
"
"Okay, so Bob and Dave switch partners, then Dave and Claire switch partners.  Then Claire and Eve switch partners.  Then Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Then Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then Bob and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Fred and Eve switch partners. 

So, who is Alice dancing with at the end? 
 
Think about it! 
 
I think it's **(D) Sam**. 



"
"Okay, so Gertrude and Alice traded balls, then Eve and Claire, then Claire and Gertrude again.  

I think Claire got the green ball.  She got it from Gertrude and then traded with Alice. 


"
"Fred got The Pearl. 

Here's why:

* Fred and Bob swapped books.
* Bob and Gertrude swapped books.
* Fred and Gertrude swapped books. 
* Alice and Gertrude swapped books.
* Claire and Gertrude swapped books.
* Alice and Gertrude swapped books.
* Dave and Eve swapped books.

Fred got the book that Gertrude had, and Gertrude got the book that Fred had. 


"
"Bob is a right midfielder, so he's good at passing the ball.  Alice is a cheerleader, so she's good at cheering.  Fred is a striker, so he's good at scoring goals.  Gertrude is a goalkeeper, so she's good at stopping the ball.  Dave is a center midfielder, so he's good at passing the ball to the striker. 

So, the final positions are:

* Bob - Right midfielder
* Alice - Right winger
* Claire - Fullback
* Dave - Center midfielder
* Eve - Striker
* Fred - Goalkeeper
* Gertrude - Cheerleader

"Okay, so we got a bunch of colors and some swapping!  

* Dave and Fred swap gifts, then Gertrude and Dave swap gifts, then Dave and Fred swap gifts again.  
* Then Claire and Alice swap gifts, then Claire and Dave swap gifts again. 
* Bob and Dave swap gifts.
* Finally, Alice and Eve swap gifts.

So, Gertrude got Dave's present, then Dave got Fred's present, and Fred got Dave's present again.  

Gertrude got a present from Dave.  

So Gertrude has the **(D) brown present**. 



"
"Bob is playing right winger.

* The players swap positions, but no one changes Gertrude's position. 


"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of presents and people swap them.  

Fred got a black ball.  That's what I got. 
 
I think Fred got the black ball. 
 
 
"
"Bob got The Fellowship of the Ring. 

Here's why:

* **Bob started with The Fellowship of the Ring.**  
* **He traded with Alice, then Dave, then Fred, and finally Bob.** 
* **He never traded his book with anyone else.** 


"
"Bob got the orange ball.

"
"Fred has The Pearl.

Bob got a red ball, right?  He traded with Dave, and then with Fred.  Fred got a green ball, and then traded with Claire.  Claire got a black ball, and then traded with Gertrude.  Alice got a blue ball, and then traded with Eve.  

So, Bob got a red ball. 


 
"
"Eve and Alice traded positions, then Alice and Fred traded positions.  Then Alice and Gertrude traded positions.  So, Alice is now playing left winger.  Claire is now playing right winger.  So the answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of dancers and they're all switchin' partners.  

Let's see... Alice and Bob switch, then Eve and Gertrude, then Claire and Gertrude, then Gertrude and Bob, then Claire and Bob again, then Fred and Gertrude, and finally Claire and Dave. 

So, who's with who at the end?  I think it's gotta be **(A) Melissa**. 



"
"Okay, so Fred and Eve switch partners, then Bob and Dave switch partners.  Then Eve and Alice switch partners again.  Bob and Claire switch partners.  Eve and Alice switch partners again.  Then Fred and Gertrude switch partners.  Bob and Dave switch partners again.  

So, Claire is dancing with Sam. 


 
"
"Okay, so Bob and Dave switch partners, then Fred and Bob switch partners.  Then Fred and Claire switch partners.  So, Bob is with Helga now.

I think... I think Claire got the yellow present.  

Why?  Because she and Dave swapped gifts.  
"
"Okay, so we got all these books, see?  Alice got Catch-22, Bob got The Fellowship of the Ring, Claire got Frankenstein, Dave got Moby Dick, Eve got Ulysses, Fred got The Pearl, and Gertrude got The Odyssey.  

They all traded books, see?  Alice and Eve traded, then Dave and Fred traded, then Gertrude and Bob traded, and so on.  

So, at the end, Gertrude got The Odyssey.  That's the answer. 


"
"Okay, so Fred and Bob traded balls, then Eve and Fred, then Dave and Eve, and so on.  

Alice got the blue ball from Bob, so now she has the blue ball. 


 
"
"Okay, so Bob and Fred switched places, then Bob and Dave switched places, and then Gertrude and Eve switched places.  Then Bob and Dave switched places again.  Then Gertrude and Dave switched places again.  And then Eve and Alice switched places.  And finally, Alice and Claire switched places.  

So, Dave is playing center midfielder. 


 
"
"Bob got the orange ball. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice swapped:**  They started with blue and black.

* **Dave and Bob switch partners.**
* **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
* **Alice and Gertrude switch partners.**
* **Dave and Alice switch partners.**
* **Eve and Gertrude switch partners.** 

We can see that Gertrude is always changing partners.  
"
"Okay, so Fred and Gertrude switch places, then Dave and Gertrude switch places, and then Gertrude and Fred switch places again.  

So, Gertrude is playing left midfielder now.  Dave is playing right midfielder.  

So the answer is (B). 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of colors and we gotta figure out what Alice has now. 

Alice starts with a white present.  Then she swaps with Eve, and Eve gives her a pink ball.  Then Alice swaps with Bob, and Bob gives her a yellow present.  Then Claire and Dave swap, and Eve and Claire swap.  Then Bob and Gertrude swap, and Eve and Alice swap.  

So, Alice has the **(B) pink ball** now. 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of dancers swap partners.  

Dave and Fred switch partners, then Dave and Gertrude switch partners.  Then Dave and Bob switch partners.  

So Dave is with Bob now.  Bob is with Melissa.

* **Gertrude and Claire swapped:**  They started with different colors. 


Gertrude got the brown ball. 
"
"Fred is playing **(E) left midfielder**. 

Here's why:

* **Fred started as a left winger.**
* **Fred and Dave traded positions.**
* **Dave was a left midfielder.** 

So Fred moved to left midfielder. 
"

"
"Bob is playing **(A) goalkeeper**. 

Here's why:

* We know Bob started as the goalkeeper.
* The positions changed, but Bob never moved from his spot. 
*  The positions changed, but Bob stayed in his spot. 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of presents and people swap them.  

Gertrude got the orange ball.  That's what I got! 
 
I think it's a good present. 
"
"Okay, so Claire and Fred switched partners, then Claire and Dave switched partners.  Then Alice and Bob switched partners.  Then Claire and Eve switched partners.  Then Dave and Claire switched partners.  Then Gertrude and Eve switched partners.  Finally, Bob and Eve switched partners. 

So, Fred is dancing with Eve now. 

The answer is (E). 
"
"Okay, so Eve and Claire switch partners, then Dave and Fred switch partners.  Then Alice and Claire switch partners.  Gertrude and Eve switch partners.  Alice and Bob switch partners.  Dave and Eve switch partners.  Fred and Gertrude switch partners.  

So, Gertrude is dancing with Karl at the end. 


 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of books, see?  

* Eve and Claire swap books.  That means Eve got Dave's book and Claire got Eve's book.
* Fred and Claire swap books.  Fred got Claire's book and Claire got Fred's book.
* Bob and Gertrude swap books.  Bob got Gertrude's book and Gertrude got Bob's book.
* Alice and Fred swap books.  Alice got Fred's book and Fred got Alice's book.
* Claire and Dave swap books.  Claire got Dave's book and Dave got Claire's book.
* Bob and Gertrude swap books.  Bob got Gertrude's book and Gertrude got Bob's book.
* Eve and Bob swap books.  Eve got Bob's book and Bob got Eve's book.

So, Dave got the book that Fred had.  Fred got the book that Alice had.  Alice got the book that Bob had.  Bob got the book that Gertrude had.  Gertrude got the book that Bob had.  Eve got the book that Bob had.  

So, Dave got **(A) The Pearl**. 



"
"Okay, so Dave and Bob switch partners, then Claire and Bob switch partners, and so on.  

Bob is always changing partners, so Gertrude is probably dancing with Sam.

"Okay, so Bob and Fred switch partners, then Gertrude and Eve switch partners.  Then Fred and Bob switch partners again.  Then Claire and Fred switch partners.  Then Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then Claire and Bob switch partners again.  Finally, Bob and Dave switch partners. 

So, Fred is dancing with Dave now. 



 
"
"Dave got the red ball. 

Here's why:

* **Dave and Fred swapped:**  Dave got the orange ball from Fred.
* **Dave and Gertrude swapped:** Dave got the red ball from Gertrude. 



"
"Okay, so Gertrude and Alice switched partners, then Dave and Claire switched partners, and so on.  

I think...  Gertrude and Alice switched partners first.  Then Dave and Claire switched partners.  Then Bob and Claire switched partners.  Then Gertrude and Eve switched partners.  Then Claire and Fred switched partners.  Then Fred and Alice switched partners.  Finally, Gertrude and Dave switched partners. 

So, the last one is Gertrude and Dave. 

So the answer is (G) Lola.

"Okay, so we got a bunch of presents and people swap them.  

Eve got a brown present.  

I think it's a good present.

Let's see... Claire and Eve switch partners.  Then Gertrude and Alice switch partners.  Then Bob and Alice switch partners.  Eve and Gertrude switch partners.  Fred and Claire switch partners.  Fred and Bob switch partners.  Finally, Dave and Fred switch partners. 

So, who's dancing with Bob at the end?  Bob is dancing with...  (pause)  I think it's Patrick. 


"
"Eve got the red present. 

Here's why:

* Fred and Eve swapped gifts. 
* Fred got Eve's present. 
* Eve got Fred's present. 


 
"
"Okay, so we got all these books, see?  Bob and Gertrude traded books, then Eve and Dave, then Alice and Gertrude, and so on.  It's like a big book swap party!  

Dave got Moby Dick, right?  That's the one with the whale, big and scary.  So the answer is (E). 
"

"Eve got Ulysses. 

Here's why:

* Eve and Gertrude swapped books first.
* Eve and Alice swapped books after that.
* Eve and Dave swapped books last. 

Eve got Ulysses from Gertrude, then traded with Alice. 


"
"Eve is playing **(D) striker**. 

Here's why:

* The positions are changing, but Eve is always the one who is playing striker. 
*  The positions are changing, but Eve is always the one who is playing striker. 



"
"Alice is playing left midfielder. 

Here's why:

* **Alice started as left midfielder.**  
* **Alice and Dave traded positions.**  
* **Alice and Claire traded positions.** 
* **Alice and Dave traded positions again.** 


This is a simple pattern. Alice is always playing left midfielder. 
"
"Eve and Dave swap balls a lot!  Maybe Eve got the purple ball from Alice.  Then, Bob and Alice swap balls.  Claire got the pink ball from Gertrude.  So the answer is (G). 


"
"Bob is playing right winger. 

Here's why:

* **We know the positions at the start:**  Bob is right winger, Alice is right midfielder, Claire is center midfielder, Dave is fullback, Eve is left winger, Fred is cheerleader, and Gertrude is striker.
* **The trades happen:**  The positions swap around.
* **Bob stays right winger:**  The positions change, but Bob never changes positions. 


Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! ⚽ 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of balls!  Alice got a purple ball, and then she traded with Eve.  Then Dave and Fred traded, and then Alice and Gertrude.  Fred and Claire traded, and then Bob and Fred traded again.  Gertrude and Bob traded, and then Gertrude and Claire traded.  

So, who got the ball?  I think it's Gertrude!  She got the ball from Claire. 


"
"Okay, so Fred and Claire switched partners, then Alice and Bob switched partners, and so on.  

I think... I think Eve is dancing with Jamie. 

Why? Because Fred and Claire switched partners, and then Alice and Bob switched partners.  Then, Fred and Claire switched partners again. 


"
"Dave got the blue present. 

Here's why:

* **Dave and Fred:**  Dave got Fred's present.
* **Bob and Fred:**  Bob got Fred's present.
* **Gertrude and Dave:**  Gertrude got Dave's present.
* **Dave and Claire:**  Dave got Claire's present.
* **Dave and Eve:**  Dave got Eve's present.
* **Claire and Bob:**  Claire got Bob's present.
* **Dave and Alice:**  Dave got Alice's present. 


So Dave got the blue present. 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of dancers and they're all swapping partners.  

Let's see... Alice and Bob switch, then Eve and Gertrude switch, and so on.  It's like a big dance party! 

I think Claire is dancing with **(D) Ophelia**.  

Why?  Because they switched partners, and we know who's dancing with who at the end.

Bob and Eve swap, then Claire and Gertrude swap, and so on.  It's like a big game of musical presents!

So, Claire got Dave's present.  Dave's present was a ball.  So Claire got the orange ball. 


 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of books goin' around.  

Claire got a book from someone else, and then traded it.  That's how it works, right?  So, we gotta figure out who gave Claire the book she has now. 

Let's look at the swaps:

* Gertrude and Dave swapped books.
* Fred and Eve swapped books.
* Gertrude and Bob swapped books.
* Claire and Alice swapped books.
* Eve and Claire swapped books.
* Eve and Bob swapped books.
* Bob and Alice swapped books.

So, Claire got a book from someone else, and then traded it.  

I think Claire got **(F) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 



"
"Claire is playing **(C) benchwarmer**. 

Here's why:

* The problem tells us that the players are swapping positions.
* We know Dave and Claire traded positions. 
*  This means Claire is now in Dave's old spot.

"Fred is playing **(E) left midfielder**. 

Here's why:

* **Fred started as a right winger.**
* **Fred and Claire traded positions.**
* **Claire is a left midfielder.** 
* **Fred moved to the left.** 


Let me know if you want to play another game! 
"
"Okay, so Fred and Claire switched partners, then Alice and Bob switched partners, and so on.  

I think... I think Bob is dancing with **(D) Patrick**! 


"
"Okay, so Bob and Fred switched partners, then Claire and Alice switched partners, and so on.  

Bob and Fred switched partners, so now Bob is with someone new.  

I think the answer is (D) Karl. 


"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of books, see?  Alice got Catch-22, Bob got Moby Dick, Claire got The Great Gatsby, Dave got The Odyssey, Eve got The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred got Frankenstein, and Gertrude got Lolita.  

They all traded books, see?  Alice and Bob traded, then Claire and Eve traded, and so on.

"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of dancers and they're all swapping partners.  

Let's see...  

* Alice and Gertrude switch partners.
* Dave and Gertrude switch partners.
* Fred and Gertrude switch partners.

* Gertrude and Alice switch partners.

"
"Bob got The Fellowship of the Ring. 

Here's why:

* **Bob traded with Fred:**  Fred had Hound of the Baskervilles.

Here's why:

* The positions are changing, but Fred is always moving to the right.
