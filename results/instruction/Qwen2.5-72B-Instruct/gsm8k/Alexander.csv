"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]

2. Calculate the new value of the house:
   \[
   \text{New value} = \text{Original value} + \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including repairs:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Original purchase price} + \text{Cost of repairs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

4. Calculate the profit:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
   \]

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

James runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So for each session, he runs:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:

180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, the total meters James runs a week is:

540"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day for her flock of 20 chickens.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, for 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to account for the feed already given during the morning and afternoon meals. Wendi gives:
- 15 cups in the morning
- 25 cups in the afternoon

The total amount of feed given by the end of the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the time spent downloading before the restart, the time taken for the restart, and the time to download the file again from the beginning.

1. **Initial Download Time Before Restart:**
   - Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of the 200 GB file is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Time for Windows Restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Time to Download the File Again:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again.
   - Time to download 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Initial download time + Restart time + Time to download again
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return journey is 4 hours and 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours have already passed), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Journey:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

   - Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Overtime hours worked: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
   - Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour
   - Overtime pay: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - She bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the pastries:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost:
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before selling at the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

2. Before selling at the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners, which is after selling 2 more to the red house. Therefore, before selling to the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

3. The 12 vacuum cleaners represent the amount left after selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If 12 is two-thirds of the original amount (since she sold a third), then the original amount is 12 * (3/2) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over a 12-mile trail, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Solving for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, she has 1 hour left to complete the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum these amounts after accounting for the spill.

First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
- \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the amounts of water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Total water = 6 liters (from the orange drink) + 9 liters (from the pineapple drink) = 15 liters.

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is 15 liters.

"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age of Raymond when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old and that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 + 6 = 37 \text{ years old} \]

Raymond had his son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract the age at which Raymond had his son from his current age:
\[ 37 - 23 = 14 \]

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount. If \( P \) is the original price, then the price Kyle paid is 75% of \( P \) (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

The equation is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she purchased and then subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk at $3 each is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples at $1.50 each is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 (total) - $33 (other items) = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings consumed in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will consume:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons needed is:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - One pair of heels costs $33.
   - The other pair costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - Total cost of the two pairs of high heels = \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the relationship between the cost of the boots and the high heels:**
   - The two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots.
   - Let \( B \) be the cost of the boots.
   - According to the problem, \( 99 = B - 5 \).

4. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - \( B = 99 + 5 \)

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age by \( D \) and Allen's age by \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We also know that the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D \) from the ratio equation into the sum equation:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to determine what each friend guessed.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = 80 \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S = 40 \)), we can find the number of gold coins (\( G \)):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, so over 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 60 yogurts
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. After selling them, he uses the money to buy video games and has $5 left. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine if he sold all of them or not.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games he buys:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is:
$160 (cost of video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

Since the total amount of money John had after selling his lego sets is $195 and he spent $165, this means he did indeed sell all his lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
0

"To determine John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total number of hours he runs in a week.

John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Therefore, the hours he runs on the other two days are:
- Second day: 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Third day: 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours

Adding these together gives the total hours run in a week:
3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

John runs 60 miles in a week. To find his speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

Thus, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

10 mph"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on the information given about her skipping speed.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance while running: \( 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \).
   - Distance while walking: \( 1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance: \( 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we first need to calculate the total number of pie pieces Grandma Jones initially had. Since she baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

40 pieces - 14 pieces remaining = 26 pieces taken

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. The nutritional information states that there are 250 calories per serving, and the 300g bag has 5 servings. Therefore, each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since each serving is 250 calories, we can calculate the number of grams that correspond to 200 calories by setting up a proportion:

250 calories : 60g = 200 calories : x grams

Solving for x:

x = (200 calories * 60g) / 250 calories
x = 12000 / 250
x = 48g

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate both his total revenue and his total cost, and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. She then bought a package, which we'll call \( x \) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the initial amount and the package she bought. The equation to represent this is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the package Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Determine the daily revenue from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
- Number of dozens produced per day = 252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens.

Step 2: Determine the daily revenue from selling the eggs.
- Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.
- Daily revenue = 21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42.

Step 3: Calculate the weekly revenue.
- Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 7 days = $42 * 7 = $294.

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we first need to calculate the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM.

Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour, and he sails from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours. The distance he travels is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to travel back the same distance at a rate of 6 miles per hour, the time it takes is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 pounds * (2 toys/pound) = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday:
\[ 6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360 \]

Revenue from car tires on Thursday:
\[ 4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160 \]

Total revenue on Thursday:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each.

Revenue from car tires on Friday:
\[ 12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480 \]

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity is:

5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

1245 pounds / 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

Since the number of boxes must be a whole number, and we cannot load a fraction of a box, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is 83.

"To solve this problem, we first need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total revenue from selling the specified number of pots.

1. **Rounding the prices:**
   - Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
   - Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
   - Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

2. **Calculating the revenue for each type of flower:**
   - Revenue from marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00
   - Revenue from petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00
   - Revenue from begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00

3. **Total revenue:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from marigolds + Revenue from petunias + Revenue from begonias
   - Total revenue = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

Therefore, Artie will make $88.00.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level, starting from the top and working our way down.

Given that the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Number of levels = 4

Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.

\[ \text{Total potato salad for adults} = 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10 \, \text{lbs}}{2} = 5 \, \text{lbs} \).
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.

\[ \text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:

\[ \text{Total potato salad needed} = 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5, so before dropping any, he had:
   \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.

2. The 115 cookies are 15 more than he intended to bake, so the number he intended to bake is:
   \( 115 - 15 = 100 \) cookies.

3. He intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, so the number of cookies he baked last year is:
   \( 100 \div 2 = 50 \) cookies.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use that to find out how much water entered the boat.

First, we find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, we can calculate her rowing speed and then the total distance:

1. Calculate the rowing speed:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

2. Calculate the total distance rowed in 64 seconds:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Determine the amount of water that entered the boat. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet:
   \[
   \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}
   \]

Thus, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water and the ratio between them.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We can set up the following proportion to find out how many of these 120 parts are teaspoons of sugar:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Where \( x \) is the number of teaspoons of sugar. To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve the equation:

\[
7 \times 120 = 20 \times x
\]

\[
840 = 20x
\]

\[
x = \frac{840}{20}
\]

\[
x = 42

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Count**: On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

2. **Total Vehicles After Second Day**: After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port is 30.

3. **Vehicles Added on the Second Day**: The number of vehicles added on the second day is the difference between the total number of vehicles after the second day and the number of vehicles on the first day:
   \[
   30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

4. **Number of Containers on the Second Day**: Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
   \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Lylah's new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary.
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 \).
   - Total salary = \( 99,076.92 \).

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars).

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation for \( W \):
  \[
  W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q
  \]

Now, we substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
\]
\[
7Q = 700
\]
\[
Q = 100
\]

Now that we have \( Q \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
\]
\[
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400
\]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much he would earn if he worked those hours instead.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, if he worked the 14 hours he usually spends playing video games, he would earn:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"To calculate the total cost, we first need to determine which items are nonfood and then apply the 10% tax to those items. Milk and eggs are food items, so they are not taxed. The nonfood items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The cost of the food items is:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total for food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total for nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

The tax on the nonfood items is 10% of $10, which is:
$10 * 0.10 = $1

The total cost of the nonfood items after tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

The total cost for everything is the sum of the food items and the taxed nonfood items:
$5 + $11 = $16

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests occur in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples per harvest
John has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare yields 100 pineapples.
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year.
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which means it has \(500 / 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return to the hive. This means:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees return}
   \]
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive. This means:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees leave}
   \]
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned returns to the hive. We need to determine how many bees this is:
   - Initially, 30 bees left.
   - 15 of these 30 bees returned.
   - Therefore, the number of bees that left and had not yet returned is:
     \[
     30 - 15 = 15 \text{ bees}
     \]
   - Additionally, 60 more bees left the hive.
   - Thus, the total number of bees that left and had not yet returned is:
     \[
     15 + 60 = 75 \text{ bees}
     \]
   - All 75 of these bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance to home in feet:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance to home in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home.

Steve's time to get home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Tim's time to get home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in their times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar).

500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to the original number. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Final fries left:** 5 fries.
2. **Ants carried off 1 fry:** Before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:** If the raccoon stole two-thirds, then one-third was left. So, the 6 fries represent one-third of the fries before the raccoon took them. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(6 \times 3 = 18\) fries.
4. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:** The pigeons ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. So, before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:** Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. Therefore, before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. **Dave ate 14 fries:** Before Dave, there were \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on each type of day:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**: Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long.
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays**: Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long.
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all the days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total class hours for the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, in this case, feet. Here are the steps:

1. **Convert the length of each type of baked good to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long, so each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Each baguette is already given as 2 feet long.

2. **Calculate the total length for each type of baked good:**
   - Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
   - Total length of croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
   - Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

3. **Sum the total lengths:**
   - Total length = \( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back-and-forth run is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).

\[ \text{Blake's total distance} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).

\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 1 \times 200 \text{ yards} + 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} \]
\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 200 \text{ yards} + 2720 \text{ yards} = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

**Difference in Distance:**
To find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance.

"To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then increase it by 50%.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate the amount she wants to pay each month, which is 50% more than the minimum:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500
   - Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total annual payment:
   - Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

"To determine the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total revenue and then their total costs, including the cost of lemons.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let's denote the total revenue as \( R \) and the total cost as \( C \).
   - The profit formula is: \( \text{Profit} = R - C \).
   - Given the profit is $25, we have: \( 25 = R - C \).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, totaling $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total cost \( C \) is then \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - The revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - The total revenue \( R \) from \( G \) gallons is \( 10G \).

4. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( R \) and \( C \) into the profit equation: \( 25 = 10G - 5G \).
   - Simplify: \( 25 = 5G \).
   - Solve for \( G \): \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the cost of lemons is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is $15.

"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.
6. The final amount will be the remaining money after all expenses and donations.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel**: Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Rent and Car Fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Expenses for Daughter and Wife**:
   \[
   \text{Expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final Remaining Amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final Remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after all expenses and donations, Zaid will have 350 dollars left.

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( C \).

Given:
\[ 200 = 5C \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses as follows:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identate the ages:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's current age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's current age.
   - Jan's current age is given as 30.

2. **Set up the relationships:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

3. **Determine Jan's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's age two years ago was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).

4. **Set up the equation for Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - According to the problem, \( M - 2 = 5 + \frac{28}{2} \).

5. **Solve for Mark's age two years ago:**
   - \( M - 2 = 5 + 14 \)
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

6. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Since Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \)
   - \( J = 21 + 2 \)
   - \( J = 23 \)

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
   - To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
     \[
     (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

Thus, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.
2. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
3. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
4. 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
5. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each with one hamster.
6. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits:

- Hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw.
- Rabbits: 20 pieces of straw.

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits:
50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70 pieces of straw.

Subtract this from the total straw to find out how much straw is used for the rats:
160 (total) - 70 (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the number of rats can be calculated as:
90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is:
15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

1. **Cost per bag**: The cost to the trader for each bag is the purchase price plus the transportation cost, which is $20 + $2 = $22 per bag.

2. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.

3. **Profit per bag**: The profit made on each bag is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $30 - $22 = $8 per bag.

4. **Total profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400.

5. **Number of bags sold**: To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50

2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees.

Step 1: Net number of trees planted each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees planted each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and then calculate the earnings from each publisher.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, we get:

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93:
- The formula for the average is: \(\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{\text{Number of Tests}}\)
- We want the average of the five highest scores to be 93:
  \[
  93 = \frac{\text{Total Score of 5 Tests}}{5}
  \]
- Solving for the total score:
  \[
  \text{Total Score of 5 Tests} = 93 \times 5 = 465
  \]

Now, we need to find the total score of the five highest tests:
- The sum of the first five scores is:
  \[
  89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
  \]
- Since we are removing the lowest score (71), the sum of the remaining four scores is:
  \[
  438 - 71 = 367
  \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total score of the five highest tests will be:
\[
367 + x
\]

We need this total to be 465:
\[
367 + x = 465
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 465 - 367 = 98
\]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode, we can break it down into two parts: the first four weeks and the following three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 4 * 125 = 500 kilometers.

For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 3 * 120 = 360 kilometers.

Adding the two parts together:
- Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40 grams/chocolate bar = 1000 grams

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20 grams/candied apple = 1600 grams

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000 grams (chocolate bars) + 1600 grams (candied apples) = 2600 grams

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought after all three days, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we add up the cakes bought on each day to find the total:

- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes bought = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost for 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
   - Cost per cup = $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
2 pairs * $20/pair = $40

Adding the cost of the jacket:
$30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs is:
$70 - $10 = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
4 times * $5/time = $20

Adding this to her initial savings:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30

Now, the remaining amount she needs after babysitting is:
$60 (needed) - $30 (earned from babysitting and initial savings) = $30

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $30, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$30 / $4/lawn = 7.5

Since Sara cannot mow a half lawn, she will need to mow the lawn 8 times to earn enough money.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs produced by the red and white chickens is 42:
   \[
   3R + 5W = 42
   \]

2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens:
   \[
   W = R + 2
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

\[
3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
\]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8R + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8R = 32
\]
\[
R = 4
\]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter for \( d \) and Gary's walking speed for \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers (first day) + 50 more customers = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers over the first two days: 100 customers (first day) + 150 customers (second day) = 250 customers.
4. Given that the total number of customers by the end of the third day is 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total of the first two days from the total of all three days: 500 customers (total) - 250 customers (first two days) = 250 customers.

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of payments, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, including the 10% interest.

1. Calculate the total amount to be repaid:
   - Principal amount: $2000
   - Interest: 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200
   - Total amount to be repaid: $2000 + $200 = $2200

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Total payments over 12 months: $165 * 12 = $1980

3. Calculate the remaining balance after 12 months:
   - Total amount to be repaid: $2200
   - Total amount paid: $1980

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we first need to determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the information given.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we can calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points of the other three students from the overall total:
- Jojo's points: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes her 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes her 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen he made.

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pen pals Mike is currently writing to:
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped writing to 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he is now writing to \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. Determine the number of letters Mike receives each week:
   - Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.

3. Calculate the total number of pages Mike receives each week:
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages a week.

4. Determine the number of pages Mike writes in response:
   - Mike responds in kind, so he writes 30 pages a week.

5. Calculate the time Mike spends writing each week:
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

6. Convert the time spent writing from minutes to hours:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, Mike spends \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours writing each week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin now has:
   \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is:
   \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   So, Griffin now has:
   \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is:
   \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   So, Griffin now has:
   \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) fries.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \( x \). Therefore:
   \( 7 + x = 27 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 27 - 7 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information and setting up the equations.

1. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
3. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \( f \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

The total weight of the tree is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, the weight of the wood they ate is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the current weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body, which is \(900 / 10 = 90\) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the entire sweater is 1800.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[ 630 \text{ stitches} / 2 = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of seed and then add them together.

For the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets.
- Each packet costs $40.
- The total cost for tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.

For the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets.
- Each packet costs $30.
- The total cost for celery seeds is 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400.

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost = Cost of tomato seeds + Cost of celery seeds
- Total cost = $800 + $2400
- Total cost = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given and calculate the lines for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines in the lyrics.
   - All 54 lines are his to memorize.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - The song has 54 lines, so the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - The song has 54 lines, so the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time required for each type of hole and then sum these times.

1. Time to dig 30 small holes:
   - Each small hole takes 3 minutes.
   - Therefore, 30 small holes will take \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

2. Time to dig 15 large holes:
   - Each large hole takes 10 minutes.
   - Therefore, 15 large holes will take \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

3. Total time in minutes:
   - Total time = Time for small holes + Time for large holes
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, 240 minutes is \(240 \div 60 = 4\) hours.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the sum of their current ages, which is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, the sum of their ages will increase by 20 (10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco).

So, the calculation is:
20 (current sum of their ages) + 20 (additional years in 10 years) = 40

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice as many as a mamba, we can find the number of spots a mamba has by dividing the number of spots a cobra has by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add these totals to find the combined number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To determine how many dollars Maddy will spend on pizza, we first need to calculate the total number of people who will be eating pizza.

There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so the number of guests is:
12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests

Adding the team members, coaches, and guests together gives us the total number of people:
12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 guests = 39 people

Each pizza serves 3 people, so the number of pizzas needed is:
39 people / 3 people/pizza = 13 pizzas

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for the pizzas is:
13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = Remaining length / Length of one bead = 17 inches / 0.25 inches/ bead = 68 beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, we first calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has 76 stars in total. Subtracting the stars already accounted for gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each 5-star row contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Thus, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of medals given out.
   - Therefore, \( 39 = \frac{T}{10} \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. Each of the 4 adults gets 6 chocolate bars:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

These 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 children:

\[ 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To determine how much Susan earns, we first need to calculate the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

The total time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours. Converting this to minutes gives us:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Since Susan takes a half-hour break, the actual working time is:
180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year and then multiply that number by the price per book.

First, let's find out how many books she sold in the first year. We know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and this year she sold 45 books. Therefore, in the first year, she sold:

2 * 45 = 90 books

Now, let's calculate the total number of books sold over the three years. We know there are 50 unsold books out of the original 250, so the total number of books sold is:

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We can calculate this by dividing the total weight Sandy wants to lose by her weekly weight loss:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the savings on the ice cream and the milk separately and then add them together.

For the ice cream:
- Original price per tub: $13
- Discounted price per tub: $11
- Savings per tub: $13 - $11 = $2
- Total savings for 2 tubs: 2 * $2 = $4

For the milk:
- Discount per packet: $0.5
- Total savings for 4 packets: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Total savings for both items:

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over a period of fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **New Arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ new arms}
     \]

2. **New Legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ new legs}
     \]

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ new arms} + 3 \text{ new legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.
2. Multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight.

First, let's determine the total number of marbles:

- Solomon initially had 50 marbles.
- He bought 20 more marbles from Johanna, so he now has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.
- His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

Adding the marbles from his father to the total, Solomon now has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the marbles:

- Each marble weighs 2 kg.
- Therefore, the total weight of 78 marbles is \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) kg.

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

\[ C = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with the number of pencils per box:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box holds 8 pencils, we can determine the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, the number of ice cubes required is:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube adds 12 milliliters of water to the coffee, so the total amount of water added by the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Water from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream. Therefore, the total amount of liquid added to the coffee is:

\[ \text{Total liquid added} = 60 \text{ milliliters (from ice cubes)} + 15 \text{ milliliters (cream)} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Monthly salary of each junior programmer = $2000.
   - Total monthly salary for junior programmers = 40 \times 2000 = $80,000.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( H = 2C \) (twice as many chickens as cows)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself, we add the weights together:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the height of the tallest tree, let's first determine the heights of the other two trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet.

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so its height is:
2 * 17 feet = 34 feet.

"To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa receives in 5 days.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days.
3. Subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount received to find the total amount saved.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Marisa receives in 5 days.**

Marisa receives $5 each day. Over 5 days, she receives:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ dollars/day} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days.**

Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day. The cost of lollipops per day is:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying gumballs must be twice the cost of the gumballs.
   \[
   \text{Total change before buying gumballs} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how much money Billy spent on candy:**
   Billy started with $10 and had $4 left as change after buying candy.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on candy} = 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   The candy costs $1.50 per pound.

"To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we first need to find out how many apples she sold on Monday. Since Lucy sells apples at $4 each and she made $56 on Monday, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\text{Total money made on Monday}}{\text{Price per apple}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, which is:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we can sum the number of apples picked over the three days:

\[ \text{Total apples picked} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then the total amount to be repaid, which includes both the principal and the interest. After that, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. Since Karan borrowed the money for five months, we need to calculate the interest for this period.

   \[
   \text{Annual interest rate} = 10\% = 0.10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest for 5 months} = \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \times 0.10 \times 3650
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest for 5 months} = \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \times 365
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest for 5 months} = 152.0833
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.0833
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 3802.0833
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Number of months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.0833}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = 760.4167
   \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is $760.42.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold 3/5 of his land, then he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first. Then we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls in the choir:**
   - The choir has 52 members.
   - 50% of the members are boys, and 50% are girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
   - Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

2. **Determine the number of girls performing:**
   - The performance is with just the female members.
   - Number of girls performing = 26

3. **Determine the number of girls who can't make it to the show:**
   - Half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down.
   - Number of girls who can't make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

4. **Determine the number of girls who actually perform:**
   - Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

5. **Add the teachers who decide to sing with them:**
   - Number of teachers = 3
   - Total number of people who sang in the performance = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers
   - Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 + 3 = 16

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ride ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing her song, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Next, we calculate the total time spent on all activities:
Total time = Time writing + Time recording + Time editing
Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total time = 7.5 hours

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total time that was spent editing:
Percentage of time editing = (Time editing / Total time) * 100
Percentage of time editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100
Percentage of time editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of time editing = 20%

Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day.

2. Convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatt-hours (kWh):
   - 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt-hours.
   - Daily energy consumption in kWh = 7200 watt-hours/day / 1000 = 7.2 kWh/day.

3. Calculate the energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day:
   - New usage time = 8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption in kWh = 2700 watt-hours/day / 1000 = 2.7 kWh/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kWh/day - 2.7 kWh/day = 4.5 kWh/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Adding the cost of the meat and the cheese together gives us the total cost:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **After Buying More Cannolis:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **New Quantity of Corns:**
   - Allan now has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis, the number of corns is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total of corns and cannolis is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 160.

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 5,000 steps. Additionally, he took 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend. This brings the total number of steps he has taken so far to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before the jog, he had 2,000 steps left plus the steps he took during the jog. Since he had 4,000 steps left before the jog (10,000 - 6,000), and he only has 2,000 steps left after the jog, he must have taken 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of Purchases:**
   - Total cost for taffy: $4.50
   - Total cost for seashells: $1.50
   - Total cost for magnets: $1.00
   - Total cost for all items: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - She spent $7.00.
   - Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

1. Calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:
   - The first pack costs $400.
   - The second pack costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

2. Add the costs of the two packs to find the total cost before the discount:
   - Total cost before discount = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200.
   - Discount amount = 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

4. Subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the total cost after the discount:
   - Total cost after discount = $1200 - $240 = $960.

5. Add the cost of the finale firework to the total cost after the discount:
   - Total cost including the finale firework = $960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 by 30:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Next, we need to convert the total number of cookies into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of madeleine cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. We know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them will explode. Out of the candles that are more dangerous (the 1% that will explode), 5% also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find out how many candles will explode:

1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 exploding candles also smell like wet dog:

5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

1. Calculate the discount per blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is 30% of $20.
   - \( 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price per blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost is the discounted price per blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
   - \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) dollars.

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and set up equations to find the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
   - From the average trees: Let's denote this as \( x \) apples.

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both sisters:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 \)
   - Combined total: \( (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500 \)

Now, let's set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
\]

Combine the known values:

\[
150 + x = 500
\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = 500 - 150
\]

\[
x = 350
\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- Each camel has 1 head and 2 humps.
- Each dromedary has 1 head and 1 hump.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ D = 360 - 304 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. For the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day:
   \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \)

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled over the first four days:
   \( 30\% \times 800 \, \text{km} = 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \)

3. On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
   \( 0 \, \text{km} \)

4. During the second week (7 days), he traveled 300 kilometers each day:
   \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \)

Now, we sum the distances from each segment to find the total distance traveled:
\( 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \)

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can solve for Zack's locker size:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Multiplying both sides by 4 to solve for Zack's locker size:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can set up another equation:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Substituting the size of Zack's locker:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for Timothy's locker size:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   - 6 months * $8/month = $48

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   - 8 months * $12/month = $96

3. **Remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   - 2 years = 24 months
   - 24 months - 6 months (first period) - 8 months (second period) = 10 months
   - 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we sum up the costs for all periods:
- $48 (first 6 months) + $96 (next 8 months) + $140 (remaining 10 months) = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after a $4 savings, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after a $2 savings, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Homemade Feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 20 birds plus an additional 10 birds, totaling 30 birds per feeder.
   - Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds.

2. **Store-Bought Feeders:**
   - Lillian buys 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds.

3. **Total Number of Birds:**
   - Adding the birds attracted by the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders gives us \(90 + 60 = 150\) birds.

Thus, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs of each item she ordered:

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup:
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 25\% \times \text{Cost of bagel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find the cost of the cake:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needed to make from selling his cards and then figure out how many cards he sold to achieve this.

1. The cost of the amusement park ticket is $100.
2. Kenny also wants to have $50 in spending cash.
3. Therefore, the total amount of money Kenny needs is $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

Kenny sells each card for $1.5. To find out how many cards he needs to sell to make $150, we divide the total amount needed by the price per card:

\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\text{Total amount needed}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards. If 100 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, we can find the total number of cards he started with by solving the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total number of cards} = 100 \]

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means:
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - These 18 guests would each get 2 hotdogs, totaling 36 hotdogs (18 guests * 2 hotdogs each).
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, totaling 18 hotdogs (18 guests * 1 hotdog each).
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 (for the 18 guests with 2 hotdogs) + 18 (for the 18 guests with 1 hotdog) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario**: 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means:
   - Each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is 40 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation**: The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, but 80 hotdogs were needed. The shortage is:
   - 80 hotdogs needed - 54 hotdogs prepared = 26 hotdogs short.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog**: Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs and there are 26 hotdogs short, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
   - 26 hotdogs short / 1 hotdog per guest = 26 guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost.

The amount she pays is 80% of $165.00, which is:
0.80 * $165.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is $132.00.

   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) (since his travel time is 4 minutes).
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \, \text{yards} \times 3 \, \text{feet/yard} = 9 \, \text{feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \, \text{sq ft} = 9 \, \text{ft} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \, \text{sq ft}}{9 \, \text{ft}} = 40 \, \text{ft} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \, \text{ft} + 40 \, \text{ft}) \]

\[ P = 2 \times 49 \, \text{ft} \]

\[ P = 98 \, \text{ft} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads

Total beads Elizabeth bought:
20 beads (red) + 40 beads (clear) = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads

Total beads Margareth bought:
60 beads (blue) + 80 beads (red) = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

Thus, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. Over the course of 3 hours of baking, the temperature increases by 5 degrees each hour. Therefore, the temperature increase due to baking is:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Adding this to the initial temperature:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. The total cooling effect is:

30 minutes / 10 minutes * 2 degrees = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting the cooling effect from the temperature after baking:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

"To determine the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue from the sales.

The total cost of the sneakers is given as $576 for 48 sneakers.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers * $20/sneaker = $340

Then, we calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:
48 sneakers - 17 sneakers = 31 sneakers

The revenue from the department store sales is:
31 sneakers * $25/sneaker = $775

Now, we add the revenue from both sales to get the total revenue:
$340 + $775 = $1115

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is $20 for the movie, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, making the total $21.

If you buy the regular movie ticket, it costs $12. The soda costs $3, and let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The total cost for the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda should be $2 less than the super ticket cost:
\[ 15 + P = 21 - 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

Thus, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

"To determine the cost of the potting soil for Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
For one raised bed:
\[ \text{Volume} = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds.
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Each bag costs $12.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the potting soil is:

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of puppies with spots} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of puppies with spots} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:

- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

Next, we determine how many trips are needed to transport 4500 pounds of feed with a truck that can carry 2250 pounds at a time:

- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 45 \) cents.
- This equals \( 900 \) cents or \( 9 \) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 50 \) cents.
- This equals \( 1000 \) cents or \( 10 \) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is \( 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \) dollar.
- The final cost for Kelly is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid:
- Kelly paid \( 9 \) dollars.
- Becky paid \( 8 \) dollars.
- The difference is \( 9 - 8 = 1 \) dollar.

Thus, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, so in feet:
6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark is 10 feet long, so the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents is:
(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

10%"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To determine how long Jason needs to spend walking each day to break in his new shoes, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has available to walk.

Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes, and he can walk 4 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days he can walk is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day. The total time required to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. So, the time he needs to walk each day is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Thus, Jason needs to spend 20 minutes walking each day to break in his new shoes.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

The total number of kids in the class is 32. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

   - Each ticket costs $5000.
   - Since Tom and his wife are both traveling, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     2 \times 5000 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Stay:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day is:
     \[
     1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel stay is:
     \[
     3 \times 1800 = 5400
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost of the trip is the sum of the plane tickets and the hotel stay:

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, and the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \) grains

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Weight of 2010 penny = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \) grains

Next, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 grains + 48 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many songs Luri has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

Luri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 * 20
Luri's songs = 60

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. The media player can store up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
Songs Gabriel can add = 100 - Gabriel's current songs
Songs Gabriel can add = 100 - 20
Songs Gabriel can add = 80

For Luri:
Songs Luri can add = 100 - Luri's current songs
Songs Luri can add = 100 - 60
Songs Luri can add = 40

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

Fewer songs Luri can add = Songs Gabriel can add - Songs Luri can add
Fewer songs Luri can add = 80 - 40
Fewer songs Luri can add = 40

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can.

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(4 \text{ horses} \times 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The total consumption for 5 days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags required is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Razors Without Discount:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost of 2 packs:

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on the next level
- 2 cheerleaders on the next level
- 1 cheerleader at the top

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th is 60 inches tall, the shortest girl (60 inches) will be at the top.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders, each standing on the shoulders of the ones below them. Since the height of each level is the height of the cheerleader standing on that level, we can calculate the total height as follows:

- Bottom level: 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall
- Second level: 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall
- Third level: 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall
- Top level: 1 cheerleader, 60 inches tall

Total height in inches:
\[ 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 60 \]

Calculating each term:
\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \]
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \]
\[ 60 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \]

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12:
\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we know David found 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

4. **Sheep on the farm**: The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Therefore, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo:

- **Total animals on the farm**: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- **Total animals on the zoo**: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

Finally, the combined total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo is:

\[40 \text{ (farm)} + 80 \text{ (zoo)} = 120 \text{ animals}\]

"If Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, and Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the number of items Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
12 onions / 4 = 3 onions

For potatoes:
4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato, which in total is:

3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal.
2. Calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Divide the total number of calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.**

- December 31st to January 1st: 1 day
- January has 31 days
- February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March has 31 days
- April has 30 days
- May has 31 days
- June has 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Adding these together: 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs.**

- 1 pound = 3500 calories
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.**

- Total calories to lose / Number of days = 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522.39 calories per day

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 522 calories.

"Julie initially had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes, which is:

\[ 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

So, after buying clothes, she had:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, which is:

\[ 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

After buying the CDs, she had:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

"To determine Tara's profit, we first need to calculate her total cost and total revenue, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) bags.
   - Each bag cost $4, so the total cost for the bags is \(40 \times 4 = 160\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   - Therefore, the profit is \(320 - 160 = 160\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially:

- Ali has four $10 bills, which total to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali also has six $20 bills, which total to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of skeins required for one set of winter wear (one hat, one scarf, one sweater, one pair of mittens, and one pair of socks):

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Adding these together gives the total number of skeins needed for one grandchild:

2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one grandchild by 3:

21 skeins/grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, the remaining problems are:
   \( 100 - 12 = 88 \) problems.

3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Since he did 12 problems on Monday, on Tuesday he completes:
   \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) problems.
   The remaining problems after Tuesday are:
   \( 88 - 36 = 52 \) problems.

4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. The remaining problems before Wednesday are 52, so he completes:
   \( \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \) problems.
   The remaining problems after Wednesday are:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the picking rates for each person:

1. Tony picks 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to figure out how many cups of raisins she will allocate to the oatmeal cookies. Since she divides the 27 cups of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide the total amount of raisins by 3:

\[ \text{Cups of raisins for cookies} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins, given that each batch requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. We do this by dividing the total cups of raisins for cookies by the amount needed per batch:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of electricity before adding the new device.
2. Calculate the daily cost of electricity after adding the new device.
3. Determine the weekly cost before and after adding the device.
4. Find the difference between the two weekly costs.

**Step 1: Daily cost before adding the device**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Daily cost = 12 * $1.50 = $18.00

**Step 2: Daily cost after adding the device**
- Additional consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- New total daily consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Daily cost = 14 * $1.50 = $21.00

**Step 3: Weekly cost before and after adding the device**
- Weekly cost before = $18.00 * 7 = $126.00
- Weekly cost after = $21.00 * 7 = $147.00

**Step 4: Difference in weekly cost**
- Difference = $147.00 - $126.00 = $21.00

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21.00.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Next, we convert the days into hours. Assuming a standard workday of 8 hours, 10 days of work would be:
\[ 10 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 80 \text{ hours} \]

This means one person can paint a whole house in 80 hours. If 5 people are working together, the time required to paint the house would be divided by 5:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ people}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 16 hours to paint a whole house.

"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we can start by calculating the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week, and then add the extra hours from the weeks he worked out more.

1. If Josh worked out 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, the total would be:
   \( 4 \, \text{hours/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{hours} \)

2. However, there are two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each, which is 1 hour extra per week for two weeks:
   \( 1 \, \text{extra hour/week} \times 2 \, \text{weeks} = 2 \, \text{extra hours} \)

3. There is also one week where he worked out 6 hours, which is 2 hours extra for that week:
   \( 2 \, \text{extra hours} \)

Adding these extra hours to the base total:
\( 32 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{extra hours} + 2 \, \text{extra hours} = 36 \, \text{hours} \)

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors. We know the total cost of all items and the cost of the computer and printer:

Total cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer - Cost of printer
Total cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700
Total cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, one monitor costs $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as in the first half.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves each day in the second half of the month is \( 2x \).

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Therefore, the amount he saves each day in the second half of the month is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply that by the number of days he works in a week.

Each day, Jeff walks to work and back, which is a total of 3 miles to work and 3 miles back. So, the total distance he walks in one day is:

3 miles (to work) + 3 miles (back home) = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is:

6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

Therefore, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First, she writes the alphabet in full twice:**
   - The English alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it once: 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Next, she writes half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Writing half of the alphabet once: 13 letters.

3. **Then, she re-writes everything she has already written:**
   - She has already written 52 letters (from the first step) + 13 letters (from the second step) = 65 letters.
   - Re-writing everything she has already written: 65 letters.

4. **Total letters written:**
   - First part: 52 letters.
   - Second part: 13 letters.
   - Third part: 65 letters.
   - Total: \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\) letters.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth of the phone tree. Each person or family that is called will then call 3 more families. This pattern continues in each round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount, then apply the 10% discount to the total.

1. Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
2. Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
3. Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00
4. Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Now, we add up these costs to get the total before the discount:
Total before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total:
Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Total after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ray's swimming time for 1 mile in warm water:**
   - When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
   - When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.
   - Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this time gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - In cold water, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - In warm water, Ray swims 1 mile in 34 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

4. **Determine how much longer it takes to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water:**
   - The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun moves relative to the ground, taking into account the initial angle of the pyramid.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is already at 32 degrees from the ground, we add the 50 degrees to this initial angle to find the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours.

32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs.

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles required:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles, so we need to determine how many packs are required:
20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- Total pages read in two weeks = \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
3. In 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

First, let's find the percentage error in the oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the correct setting for 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be 4% higher than \( x \):

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]

\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes gives us:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as follows:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R \) = \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G \) = \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R \) = \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G \) = \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we first need to calculate the total sum of these measurements and then divide by the number of measurements.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After some lessons, it increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his speed by another 5 WPM, his new typing speed will be:

52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we have the three measurements:
- First measurement: 47 WPM
- Second measurement: 52 WPM
- Third measurement: 57 WPM

The sum of these measurements is:
47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

To find the average, we divide the total sum by the number of measurements (3):
156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - A cup of mushrooms (100 grams) contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, 1 gram of mushrooms contains \( \frac{3}{100} = 0.03 \) grams of protein.

2. **Calculate the protein content for 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms contain \( 200 \times 0.03 = 6 \) grams of protein.

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.
   - Over a week (7 days), the total protein intake is \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams.

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, we can double the number of washes by using 1 pump per wash:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per wash. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, and there are 240 washes:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since each wash now uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the amounts of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. So, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600 to get the speed in kb per hour:

\[ 20 \, \text{kb/second} \times 3600 \, \text{seconds/hour} = 72000 \, \text{kb/hour} \]

Next, we convert kb per hour to Mb per hour. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:

\[ 72000 \, \text{kb/hour} \div 1000 = 72 \, \text{Mb/hour} \]

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in that week, we can break down the week into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
3 days * 10 cars/day = 30 cars

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than the 10 cars it pulled on the first three days. This means it pulled:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
4 days * 6 cars/day = 24 cars

Adding the totals from both parts of the week gives us the total number of cars towed:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the required height from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the required height is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches. We can set up the equation:

40 inches + (2 inches/year * number of years) = 48 inches

Now, we solve for the number of years:

2 inches/year * number of years = 48 inches - 40 inches
2 inches/year * number of years = 8 inches
number of years = 8 inches / 2 inches/year
number of years = 4

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.**
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**
The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Sales} - \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission.**
James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{James's Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

"To find the total price for all three jewels, let's break down the information given:

1. The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of diamond jewel} \]
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 \]
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = 1600 \]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = \text{Price of gold jewel} - 400 \]
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 \]
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1200 \]

Now, add the prices of all three jewels to find the total price:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 \]

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now, since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

The total cost for the classes is $60. If the cost per class must not exceed $10, then the maximum number of classes he can attend is:

\[ \text{Maximum number of classes} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Cost per class}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

This means Manny can attend a maximum of 6 classes without the cost per class exceeding $10. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he can miss is:

\[ \text{Number of classes he can miss} = \text{Total classes} - \text{Maximum number of classes he can attend} = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. Therefore, Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. If we let \(L\) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie's distance can be expressed as \(L + 3\).

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Solving for \(L\):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio initially received 2000 likes after 1 week.
2. **Likes After 3 Weeks**: Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. Therefore, the number of likes after 3 weeks is:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. **Recent Likes**: Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. So, the total number of likes now is:
   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month are \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month are \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, let's break down the costs:

1. James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.
2. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
3. The first paid hour costs $15.
4. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each paid hour:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $15 * 2 = $30
- Third hour: $30 * 2 = $60

"To determine how much of Sally's wage was withheld, we need to calculate the total amount of money that should have been in her bank account if she had received her full wage and then compare it to the actual amount in her account.

1. Sally's bank account started with $200.
2. Her weekly wage should be $300.
3. If she had received her full wage, her bank account should have $200 (initial amount) + $300 (wage) = $500.
4. However, her bank account now holds $420.
5. The difference between what should be in her account and what is actually in her account is $500 - $420 = $80.

Therefore, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is 30 minutes (for rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one for each dog, so he now has 12 (current) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys, which is exactly the number of dogs he has.

Therefore, James needs a total of 21 toys.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Next, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This $1.20 is the total cost for four candies. To find the cost of one candy, divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:
$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. First, calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00

Then, calculate the cost of 10 candies:
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Finally, add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to get the total cost:
$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves an additional 2/5 * 20 coins each month.

First, calculate the additional coins Neil saves:
\[ \text{Additional coins Neil saves} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person saves over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add Rong's and Neil's total savings to find the combined total:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - Each vaccine costs $20.
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check = 0.60 * \( T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \).

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

"To calculate the total price of the crate, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total cost of the crate:**
   - Sum the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = \(5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = \$32.0\).

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter in square feet, we need to determine the number of squares of each color and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the number of squares is equal to the area in square feet.

1. **Red Squares**: The problem states there are 14 red squares.
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   \[
   \text{White squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares, which is also the total area in square feet:
\[
\text{Total area} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares}
\]
\[
\text{Total area} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs required for the function and then compare it to the number of chairs currently available at the restaurant.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 \text{ (adults)} + 15 \text{ (babies)} = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs available:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so the number of regular chairs is:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs currently available:**
   - The total number of chairs available is the sum of the regular chairs and the high chairs:
     \[
     40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs}
     \]

4. **Determine how many more chairs are needed:**
   - The number of additional chairs needed is the difference between the total number of chairs required and the total number of chairs available:
     \[
     57 \text{ (chairs needed)} - 48 \text{ (chairs available)} = 9 \text{ chairs}
     \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

She dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (since she dances for a total of 5 minutes and her arms are raised for 2 of those minutes).

For the right foot:
\[ 300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps} \]

For the left foot:
\[ 250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised:
- Both feet: 200 taps per minute

She dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

For both feet:
\[ 200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps for each foot:
- Total taps for the right foot: \( 900 \text{ taps} + 400 \text{ taps} = 1300 \text{ taps} \)
- Total taps for the left foot: \( 750 \text{ taps} + 400 \text{ taps} = 1150 \text{ taps} \)

Finally, we add the total taps for both feet:
\[ 1300 \text{ taps} + 1150 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps} \]

The combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pizzas**: Bryce and his four friends each ordered a pizza, so there are 5 pizzas in total.
2. **Slices per pizza**: Each pizza has 12 slices.

Next, we need to calculate how many slices each group of friends ate:

- **Bryce and two friends**:
  - Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
  - Number of slices each of these three people ate: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) slices.
  - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) slices.

- **The two remaining friends**:
  - Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
  - Number of slices each of these two people ate: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \) slices.
  - Total slices eaten by the two remaining friends: \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) slices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten by all five friends:
- Total slices eaten: \( 24 + 18 = 42 \) slices.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices available:
- Total slices available: \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) slices.

Finally, we find the number of slices left:
- Slices left: \( 60 - 42 = 18 \) slices.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of this time, so we calculate the dog's time as follows:

\[ \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship, where \( B \) is the length of Bobby's shoe in inches:

\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

Now, we solve for \( B \):

\[ 9B = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9B = 90 \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\).

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\).

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\).

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\).

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars and the teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students' windows) + 48 (teachers' windows) = 112.

"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

The number of blue spools is the sum of the light blue and dark blue spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 (total blue spools)

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by adding all the spools together:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 (total spools)

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 40\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday**: 
   - By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \)

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Number of people who had not voted by midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \)

5. **People who had not voted by 16:00**:

1. **Determine Dora's father's age:**
   - Dora's age is 15 years.
   - Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   - Twice Dora's age is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
   - Eight more than twice Dora's age is \(30 + 8 = 38\).
   - Therefore, Dora's father is 38 years old.

2. **Determine Dora's mother's age:**
   - Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   - Dora's father is 38 years old.
   - Four years younger than 38 is \(38 - 4 = 34\).

"To find out how much each roommate, including Jenna, will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the monthly cost per person.
2. Multiply the monthly cost per person by the number of months in a year.

First, the total monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Since there are 5 people sharing the cost (Jenna and her 4 roommates), the monthly cost per person is:

\[ \text{Monthly cost per person} = \frac{\$100}{5} = \$20 \]

Next, to find the annual cost per person, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual cost per person} = \$20 \times 12 = \$240 \]

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.

"To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of glasses and plates sent to the party.
2. Subtract the number of broken items from the initial number to find the remaining items.

First, let's convert the dozens to individual items:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we account for the broken items:
- 10 glasses were broken, so the remaining glasses are 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- 6 plates were broken, so the remaining plates are 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:
- Total remaining items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

"To solve this problem, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Inventory:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 63 small buttons

8. **Total number of buttons:**
   - 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 92 buttons

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is equal to the total number of people on the council:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of shirts for each size.

1. **Extra-small (XS):** 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is:
   \[
   2 \times 11 = 22
   \]
3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is:
   \[
   22 - 4 = 18
   \]
4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is:
   \[
   9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of shirts for each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:
\[
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
\]

Thus, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is:

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can start by determining the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as P. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * P = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

P = 18 * (3/2)
P = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12

"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.
2. Determine the total amount of fuel used each week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the fuel used each week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, which is a round trip of:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (one way)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles per day} \]

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, which includes the amount from the quarters and the amount from the twenties.

First, let's calculate the total value of the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- The total value of the quarters is \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has ten twenties.
- The total value of the twenties is \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties:
- The amount spent from the twenties is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = value of quarters + value of spent twenties
- Total amount spent = 35 + 120 = 155 dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from both the tomato plants and the eggplant plants.

For the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has planted 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

For the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has planted 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Adding the total number of tomatoes and eggplants gives us the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 (tomatoes) + 32 (eggplants) = 142.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total number of TVs sold.

Given that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, we calculate the number of smart TVs sold as follows:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, given that one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, we calculate the number of analog TVs sold as follows:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is:

"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total amount of money required for the trip after the school's contribution. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we calculate the school's contribution as follows:

School's contribution = 1/2 * $300 = $150

The total cost of the trip is $300, so the amount John needs to raise, after the school's contribution, is:

Amount John needs to raise = Total cost - School's contribution
Amount John needs to raise = $300 - $150 = $150

John currently has $50, so the amount of money he is still missing is:

Money missing = Amount John needs to raise - Money John has
Money missing = $150 - $50 = $100

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature during the night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it is 33 degrees colder at night, the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees. The difference in temperature that needs to be made up is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, Carson will need to burn:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people are split into groups of 9, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10:

\[ \text{Number of groups with seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by these groups is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]

"To calculate Jamie's pay for the 11 hours she worked, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay**: Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.
   - Regular pay = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

2. **Overtime Pay**: For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at 150% of her regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime hourly rate = 150% of $20 = 1.5 * $20 = $30/hour
   - Overtime pay = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. **Total Pay**: The total pay for the day is the sum of the regular pay and the overtime pay.
   - Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly payroll.
3. Multiply the total monthly payroll by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid over three months.

Step 1: Determine the total number of employees after three months.
- Initial number of employees: 200
- Number of new employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Total number of new employees hired in three months = 20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

Total number of employees after three months = Initial employees + New employees
= 200 + 60 = 260 employees

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly payroll.
- Monthly salary per employee: $4000

Total monthly payroll = Number of employees * Monthly salary per employee
= 260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over three months.
Total amount paid over three months = Total monthly payroll * Number of months
= $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total collection. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, the distance it will cover is:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, the distance it will cover is:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} \).
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} \) or 40%.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it is \( 2 \times 40\% = 80\% \). Therefore, 80% of 400 fifth-graders passed, which is \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \).
- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

Expressed as a percentage, the overall pass rate is 70%.

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area that can be covered.

First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag holds 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
- Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Now, we know the mosaic is 3 inches tall, so we need to find out how long it can be:
- Area of the mosaic = height * length.
- 12 square inches = 3 inches * length.
- Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \):

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( z = 1 \) back into the equation for \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

The amount of oil is \( 2s \):

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Calculate the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he has \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars left.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Since there are 20 students, and they each earned the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

Each student raised $6,250.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days to get the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the school parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he noticed that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
4. The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the number of cycles, tasks per cycle, and the pay per task.

1. First, calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day:
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is \( 30 \times 5 = 150 \) tasks.

2. Next, calculate the daily earnings:
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the daily earnings are \( 150 \times 1.20 = 180 \) dollars.

3. Finally, calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are \( 180 \times 7 = 1260 \) dollars.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we first need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food.

For cat food:
8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins

For dog food:
6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food to find the difference:
88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so:
   \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:
   \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs: \( 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 \)

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - The shipping cost for weight is \( 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \) dollars.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - The shipping cost for distance is \( 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \) dollars.
   - The total shipping cost is \( 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - The refund amount is \( 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly will receive a refund of $24 but will have to pay $3 for shipping.

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the chain of comparisons and convert the final answer to feet.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Now, we need to convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the second part of his journey:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 6 hours
Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance \(D\) is the same for all animals. The speed of one kangaroo \(S_k\) can be calculated as:
   \[
   S_k = \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}}
   \]

2. Since the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle \(S_t\) is:
   \[
   S_t = \frac{S_k}{2} = \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). The combined speed of 4 turtles is:
   \[
   4 \times S_t = 4 \times \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{4D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}
   \]

4. The time \(T\) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \(D\) is:
   \[
   T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and her mom's contribution:
\[ P + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ P + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ P + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 350 - 230 \]
\[ P = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he gets from slicing 3 large and 5 small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples will yield:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will yield:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together gives us the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices left

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk currently produced by the 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
3 cows * 5 liters/cow/day = 15 liters/day

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The current production is 15 liters, so the additional amount needed is:
25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:
10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow/day = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

The intermission takes 10 minutes, so the time available for performances and transitions is:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to 10 minutes per group.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. To convert this to a decimal rate, we divide by the principal: \( r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs bought:
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
$110"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Baskets**: Each basket of green food costs $25. If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost for the green baskets is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75
   \]

2. **Cost of Red Baskets**: Each basket of red food costs $18. If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost for the red baskets before the discount is:
   \[
   3 \times 18 = 54
   \]

3. **Discount on Red Baskets**: You get $2 off for each basket of red food. Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Total Cost for Red Baskets After Discount**: Subtract the total discount from the total cost of the red baskets:
   \[
   54 - 6 = 48
   \]

5. **Total Cost for All Baskets**: Add the total cost of the green baskets and the total cost of the red baskets after the discount:
   \[
   75 + 48 = 123
   \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the total rooms:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Determine the total time required to clean 45 rooms, given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
   \[
   45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year. Therefore, they will build \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \( 12 + 36 = 48 \). Doubling this amount gives \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \) homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year to find the total number of homes built over the three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \) (since I am three years younger than my brother)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \) (since I am two years older than my sister)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Simplify the equation step by step:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs. This will ensure that he has enough glue sticks for all the students and some extra.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Volume of Water**: The initial volume of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Volume After Heavy Rain**: After a day of heavy rain, the volume of water doubles. Therefore, the volume of water becomes:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Volume on the Third Day**: On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the volume of water on the third day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial ten people and considering that each infected person infects six others every day.

**Day 0 (Initial Condition):**
- Infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: 10 * 6 = 60
- Total infected people: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: 70 * 6 = 420
- Total infected people: 70 (from Day 1) + 420 (new) = 490

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: 490 * 6 = 2940
- Total infected people: 490 (from Day 2) + 2940 (new) = 3430

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate Rafaela's total tips as follows:

\[ \text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total tips:

\[ \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the total amount of tips both Rafaela and Julieta received together, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In 1 year, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in 1 year is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \).

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.

Each of the 50 students was given 10 burritos, so the total number of burritos eaten by the students is:
50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so the total number of burritos eaten by Mr. George is:
20 burritos

The total number of burritos eaten by both the students and Mr. George is:
500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

Since Mr. George ordered 600 burritos, the number of leftover burritos is:
600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

"To find the number of yellow cars, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ green cars}
   \]
3. There are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ blue cars}
   \]
4. The total number of cars is 75. We can set up the equation to find the number of yellow cars:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (\text{Number of red cars} + \text{Number of green cars} + \text{Number of blue cars})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of books each person has with variables:
- Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten so far, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after the first day, he has eaten 24 pieces.

2. **Second Day:**
   Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.
   \[
   24 + 10 = 34 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after the second day, he has eaten 34 pieces in total.

3. **Remaining Pieces After Second Day:**
   The total number of pieces left after the second day is:
   \[
   60 - 34 = 26 \text{ pieces}

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses and Julie sold 14, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2:

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we know that Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the numbers together:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones do not find space to fit in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones are left without a pair. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) petals.

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) petals.

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:
- \(40 - 25 = 15\)

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To find the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
- A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.

First, we find the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we use the speed of the thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( C \).

The cost of the salad is $6, and the cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

Ellen eats two carrots, so the total cost for the carrots is \( 2C \).

The total cost for all the items she eats every day is the sum of the costs of the carrots, the salad, and the yogurt, which is \( 2C + 6 + 3 \).

We know that the total cost is $11, so we can write the equation:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot is $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payments from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6.
   - Let the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn be \( J \).

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed other lawns:**
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total payment from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6 \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 3J \times 6 \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 5J \times 6 \) dollars.

4. **Sum the payments:**
   - Total payment from mowing lawns: \( 6 + (3J \times 6) + (5J \times 6) \).

5. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Total payment from mowing lawns: \( 6 + 18J + 30J = 6 + 48J \).

6. **Determine the total earnings:**
   - Tasha made $80 in total.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + (6 + 48J) = 80 \).

7. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L + 6 + 48J = 80 \).
   - \( L = 80 - 6 - 48J \).
   - \( L = 74 - 48J \).

8. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she made $6 from Joe, \( J = 1 \).

9. **Calculate \( L \):**
   - \( L = 74 - 48 \times 1 \).
   - \( L = 74 - 48 \).
   - \( L = 26 \).

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup available and then subtract the number of bowls that will be used for dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill:
   - 4 adult bowls or
   - 8 child bowls

2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl of soup for dinner. This means:
   - 2 adult bowls will be used for dinner.

3. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to:
   - 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls

4. Calvin and his wife will use 4 child bowls worth of soup for dinner.

5. The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the remaining soup is:

4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so:
   - Number of fish = 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so:
   - Number of gerbils = 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days

"To determine how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months between her 5th and 10th birthdays.

- Martha starts collecting shells at age 5.
- She collects one shell every month.
- The period from her 5th to her 10th birthday is 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 5 years is:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

"To determine how many cups of mint tea are in each row, let's break down the information given:

1. Lana has 27 cups in total.
2. She divides these into 3 rows.
3. In each row, there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups.
4. She uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

First, we need to find out how many cups are used for cinnamon tea and how many are left for chamomile and mint tea.

Total cups = 27
Cinnamon tea cups = 15

Cups left for chamomile and mint tea = 27 - 15 = 12

Since these 12 cups are divided equally into 3 rows, each row will have:
Cups per row = 12 / 3 = 4

In each row, there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:
Mint tea cups per row = 4 / 2 = 2

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 2.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we first need to calculate how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

Given that one trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours, the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he must pick up per trip is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to meet his goal is 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial amount of water in the tank.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used after 6 days.
3. Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount to find the remaining water.

Step 1: The pool has 10,000 gallons of water. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, so the initial amount of water in the tank is:
\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 2: The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. After 6 days, the total amount of water used is:
\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 3: Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount to find the remaining water:
\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of toys Sophie already had and then subtract that total from the new total number of toys, which is 62.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Let's add these together:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48 toys.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before the bouncy balls from the new total:

62 (total toys now) - 48 (toys before bouncy balls) = 14 bouncy balls.

So, the tube of bouncy balls contained 14 bouncy balls.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( L \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two more equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we first need to calculate the total time he spends stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

1. Calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

2. Determine Vince's stapling rate:
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   - Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   - Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Thus, Vince staples a total of 1800 reports.

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking + Time she woke up early = 23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on her bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions - Total time subtracted from sleep = 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is:

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons remaining is:

16 - 6 = 10

To find the total number of utensils remaining, we add the number of measuring cups to the number of measuring spoons remaining:

24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the occupancy after 2 weeks (14 days).
   - Total patients admitted in 14 days = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

4. **Total Occupied Beds After 14 Days**: 
   - Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 14 days
   - Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

5. **Unoccupied Beds**:
   - Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
   - Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to break down the total number of emails she sends each day.

1. Robyn sends 16 emails a day.
2. Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. The remainder of the emails, which are not work emails, is \(16 - 7 = 9\) emails.

Next, we need to determine how many of these 9 emails are sent to family and how many are sent to her boyfriend.

4. Two-thirds of the 9 remaining emails are sent to family:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ emails}
   \]

5. This leaves \(9 - 6 = 3\) emails that are not to family.

6. One-third of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \text{ email}
   \]

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old.
2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So, we have:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we first need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes was four times the number of holes dug on the first day.

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day: \(10 + 13 + 6 = 29\) holes.

2. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes was four times the number of holes dug on the first day. The number of holes dug on the first day was 10, so four times this amount is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) holes.

3. To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40 holes
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29 holes

   Holes dug on the fourth day: \(40 - 29 = 11\) holes.

"To find out how much the travel costs, we first need to calculate 50% of the total cost of the supplies and then add that to the original cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400. 

50% of $400 is calculated as follows:
50% of $400 = 0.50 * $400 = $200

The total cost for the travel tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies, so:
Total travel cost = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
Total travel cost = $400 + $200 = $600

The travel costs $600.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of Pokémon each person has caught with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation. First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[
A + S + W = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Thus, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is:
\[
147

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction, as the bird's final destination is her southern home.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to individual brownies, knowing that 1 dozen equals 12 brownies.

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, let's add these quantities to find the total number of brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we need to account for the brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

2. **Calculate the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower**: Each flower requires 1 foot of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each flower. Therefore, the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (flower)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many flowers can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/flower}} = 44.4 \text{ flowers}
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   44 \text{ flowers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy**: Pat already owns 17 flowers. Therefore, the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:
   \[
   44 \text{ flowers} - 17 \text{ flowers} = 27 \text{ flowers}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional flowers**: Each flowering plant costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for 27 flowers is:
   \[
   27 \text{ flowers} \times 6 \text{ dollars/flower} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:
\[
162

"To determine the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by 5.

1. Calculate the cost for the petunias in one basket:
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias per basket.
   - Cost for petunias in one basket = 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

2. Calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket:
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines per basket.
   - Cost for sweet potato vines in one basket = 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

3. Calculate the total cost for one basket:
   - Total cost for one basket = Cost for petunias + Cost for sweet potato vines = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

4. Calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
   - Total cost for 5 baskets = 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00.

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly savings for shoes.
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so:
\[ \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, the time required is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time for peeling and the time for sauteing.
   - Total time = 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature rises by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.

The net change in temperature is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet returns every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's trips:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining one-quarter of its flights are split equally between France and Germany.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - Three-quarters of 88 trips: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips to Greece.

4. **Calculate the number of remaining trips:**
   - The remaining trips are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.

5. **Determine the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany.
   - Therefore, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we add the durations of all three howls to find the total time:

\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total time into minutes:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total age of the children**: The total age of the four children is given as 20 years.

2. **Ages of Akbar and Alessandro**: Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old. Therefore, the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro is:
   \[
   3 + 4 = 7 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Combined age of Helene and Wilfred**: Since the total age of all four children is 20 years, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Helene's age in terms of the average age**: Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
   \]
   Therefore, Helene's age is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Wilfred's age**: Since the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13 years, and Helene is 10 years old, Wilfred's age is:
   \[
   13 - 10 = 3 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is 3 years.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for the adults and the kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices. There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total watermelon is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), and since the total watermelon is \( 8x \), the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the number of sessions. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Cost per session:**
   - Studio rental: $25
   - Cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Number of students: 10
   - Total cost per student per session: 10 students * $1.50 = $15
   - Total cost per session: $25 (rental) + $15 (students) = $40

2. **Number of sessions per week:**
   - The studio is rented 3 days a week.

3. **Number of sessions per month:**
   - Assuming 4 weeks in a month, the number of sessions per month is 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

4. **Total monthly cost:**
   - Total cost per session * number of sessions per month = $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, and we have only calculated the costs, we need to clarify if there is any revenue or income mentioned. If the question is only asking about the costs, then the expected earnings (which would be negative in this case) would be the total costs.

However, if the question is asking for the total costs, which is a more likely interpretation, the answer is:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( x - 0.07x = 0.93x \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.93x - 0.07(0.93x) = 0.93^2x \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.93^2x - 0.07(0.93^2x) = 0.93^3x \).

   Given that the final charge is 28%, we have:
   \[
   0.93^3x = 0.28
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.93^3}
   \]
   \[
   x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( y - 0.09y = 0.91y \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.91y - 0.09(0.91y) = 0.91^2y \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^2y - 0.09(0.91^2y) = 0.91^3y \).
   - After 4 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^3y - 0.09(0.91^3y) = 0.91^4y \).
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^4y - 0.09(0.91^4y) = 0.91^5y \).

   Given that the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was 34.8%, we have:
   \[
   0.91^5y = 0.348
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.91^5}
   \]
   \[
   y \approx \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.558
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 55.8%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.8%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

Next, we calculate Janet's total earnings per hour, which include both her wages and tips.

\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

Now, we calculate her total earnings per week, given that she works 40 hours a week.

\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, we add up the total cost of these fruits:

$1.50 (peaches) + $2.00 (pears) + $2.00 (kiwis) + $3.75 (apples) = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then calculate the total number of selfies and portraits based on the given information.

1. First, we find out how many pictures are in each album:
   - Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums.
   - Therefore, each album contains \( \frac{72}{8} = 9 \) pictures.

2. Next, we calculate the total number of selfies:
   - 3 of the albums were selfies only.
   - Each of these albums contains 9 pictures.
   - Therefore, the total number of selfies is \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \).

3. Then, we calculate the total number of portraits:
   - 2 of the albums were portraits.
   - Each of these albums contains 9 pictures.
   - Therefore, the total number of portraits is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \).

4. Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits to get the total:
   - Total number of selfies and portraits = 27 + 18 = 45.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds of ore per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the amount mined with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds of ore per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:
\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds of ore per day} \]

"Tom initially pays $1000 towards the new bedroom set, reducing the total cost from $3000 to $2000. The remaining $2000 is what he needs to pay off with a 10% monthly interest rate.

To calculate the monthly payment, we need to understand that the 10% interest is applied to the remaining balance each month. However, the question does not specify the term of the loan or the method of repayment (e.g., fixed monthly payments, interest-only payments, etc.). Assuming the simplest case where Tom pays only the interest each month, the monthly payment would be 10% of the remaining balance of $2000.

Monthly interest payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly interest payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly interest payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month in interest. If the question implies that Tom is paying off the principal as well, more information would be needed to calculate the exact monthly payment. However, based on the information provided, the monthly interest payment is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a substitute is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two further scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If an extension is given, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving a class extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If no class extension is given, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment:
         - Probability of getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
         - So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of all probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
   - Total probability of not turning in homework = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Turning in Homework:**
   - Probability of turning in homework = 1 - Probability of not turning in homework
   - Probability of turning in homework = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in school, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost while in school:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider on each side. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece of fabric will be:

Length: 6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Each piece of fabric will thus measure 8 feet by 10 feet. The area of one piece of fabric is:

Area = Length × Width = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:

Total area = 2 × 80 square feet = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

Next, we calculate the average loss per race:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = \(21.5 / 3 = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss is $7.17.

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since heights are given in both feet and inches, we will convert everything to inches for simplicity.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
1 inch"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \). According to the problem, the second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars, and the third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year after his accident, we first need to calculate the new monthly cost of the insurance.

The normal cost of the insurance is $120 a month. After the accident, the cost is 60% more than the normal cost. To find the increased cost, we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 60\% \times 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increase in cost is $72. Adding this to the normal cost gives us the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

"To determine the number of laundry loads Greg does in a year, we first need to calculate the number of loads he does each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

For the twin beds:
- He has 4 twin beds, and the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time.
- Therefore, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.

For the king size bed:
- He has 1 king size bed, and the machine can wash 1 king set at a time.
- Therefore, he needs 1 load for the king size bed.

In total, each week he does 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads of laundry.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Therefore, for one feeding, the total amount of food consumed is \( 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams} \).

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, the total daily consumption is:
   - \( 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \).

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

   - Jenny has five 5 dollar bills, so she has 5 * $5 = $25.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny receives:**
   - Change = Total money - Total cost = $25 - $21 = $4.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Number of quarters = $4 / $0.25 = 16.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

The total number of toothpicks required for the sculpture is 200. Thus, the number of toothpicks Melanie still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save 80 more toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The watch was sold at 75% of its original price. The original price of the watch is $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid for it.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold to his friend} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

**Step 4: Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.**

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during the month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.
3. **BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.
4. **MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars.
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars (since BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, \( 500 / 2 = 250 \) dollars).
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total time he spends in class during the week and the additional time he spends on weekends.

1. **Calculate the total class time during the week:**
   - John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes each day, which totals 8 classes per day.
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - He goes to class for 5 days a week.

   \[
   \text{Total class time per day} = 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total class time per week} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the extra learning time on weekends:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on each of Saturday and Sunday.

   \[
   \text{Extra learning time per day on weekends} = \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total extra learning time on weekends} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total learning time per week:**
   - Add the total class time during the week to the total extra learning time on weekends.

   \[
   \text{Total learning time per week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

4. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

   \[
   \text{Total learning time per week in hours} = \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To determine how high the ball bounces on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is:
   \[
   3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Calculate the height of the first bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Calculate the height of the second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of the height of the first bounce, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means that the 270 kilograms of meat the Allosaurus ate was the other half. Therefore, before the velociraptors ate, there must have been 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex ate was the other half. Therefore, before the T-Rex ate, there must have been 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, you need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

There are three women wearing 4-inch heels and three women wearing 2-inch heels. 

First, calculate the total height of the heels:
- Total height of 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
- Total height of 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches

Now, add these totals together to get the overall total height:
- Total height of all heels: \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches

Next, divide the total height by the number of women to find the average height:
- Number of women: \(3 + 3 = 6\)
- Average height of heels: \(18 \div 6 = 3\) inches

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and then figure out how many miles she plans to hike each day.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and the distance she will cover at her current plan is:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Apples**: The total amount of apples is 12 kg.

2. **Pierre's Share**: Pierre wants a quarter of the apples.
   \[
   \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ kg} = 3 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Paul's Share**: Paul wants one-third of the apples.
   \[
   \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \text{ kg} = 4 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Total Share of Pierre and Paul**: Add Pierre's and Paul's shares together.
   \[
   \text{Total share of Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Remaining Apples for Jacques**: Subtract the total share of Pierre and Paul from the total amount of apples.
   \[
   \text{Remaining apples for Jacques} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
   \]

Therefore, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we can start by determining how much money Anna has spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she has spent:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

She had already spent $4 before buying the two books today, so the amount spent on the two books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since the two books cost the same amount and together they cost $10, the cost of each book is:

\[ 10 \div 2 = 5 \]

Each book cost $5.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse blinks. We know that the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can calculate the rate of blinking per minute by dividing the total number of blinks by the total time in minutes:

\[ \text{Rate of blinking} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks we want (459) by the rate of blinking (51 blinks per minute):

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent on their respective tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = Amalia's time + 4 hours = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, we sum the times:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance**: Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula for distance, which is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the round trip distance**: Since John drives to his parents' house and back, the round trip distance is:
   \[
   \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly distance**: John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles/visit} \times 2 \, \text{visits/month} = 560 \, \text{miles/month}

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The two workers who produce 6 toys per hour each will produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The two workers who produce 4 toys per hour each will produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of toys produced by the four workers:
\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys, which means that the total number of toys produced by all five workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: They painted the same number of eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs each of them painted as \( A \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: They painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Camden painted as \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \).

From the information given:
- \( C + S = 30 \)
- \( C = S + 12 \)

We can substitute \( C \) in the first equation with \( S + 12 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. Since the total number of eggs is 56 and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs:
\[ A + A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds.

1. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into groups of 8.
   - Number of boxes = 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.

2. **Calculate the weight of the crayons:**
   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   - Total weight of crayons = 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.

3. **Calculate the weight of the boxes:**
   - Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   - Total weight of boxes = 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

4. **Calculate the total weight:**
   - Total weight = weight of crayons + weight of boxes = 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

5. **Convert the total weight to pounds:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. Speed is calculated as distance divided by time, so her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of the marbles he has. We subtract 10 from the current number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the 33-degree water, results in a mixture that is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water. The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[
\text{Mixture Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\text{Mixture Temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that the mixture temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of cows added is \( 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \).

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of chickens added is \( 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \).

Now, let's add these increases to the initial numbers:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

Total number of cows after three weeks:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

Total number of chickens after three weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount applied, and then divide that total cost by the total number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   - Each pack costs $10.00.
   - Russell orders 4 packs.
   - Total cost without discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

3. Calculate the total cost with the discount:
   - Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

4. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   - Each pack has 9 bagels.
   - Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

5. Calculate the cost per bagel:

- 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.
- 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:
- If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes.
- For 18 scoops, the number of potatoes required is \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, let's first determine the number of red jellybeans. According to the problem, there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:

\[ 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 passengers (5 men + 9 women), 5 are men and 9 are women.

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many groups of 14 passengers there are on the bus:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Since each group of 14 passengers contains 9 women, the total number of women on the bus initially is:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to consider both the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers that are part of the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets per day is:
- \( 7 \text{ bouquets/day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers/bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day} \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = individual sunflowers + sunflowers in bouquets
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84 = 97.

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
- Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day \(\times\) 3 days = 291.

"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time required for each type of picture scene and then sum these times.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - Time required for large-sized scenes = 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - Time required for medium-sized scenes = 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - Time required for small-sized scenes = 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days.

Now, we sum the time required for each type of scene:

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total for the weekdays and the weekend separately and then add them together.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend, so:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots eaten during the weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**

   Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand (100% / 20% = 5 bottles).

   Therefore, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
   \[
   2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine the current production capacity:**

   Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**

   The additional number of bottles required is the difference between the total number of bottles needed and the current production capacity:
   \[
   11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
5. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

Now, we need to sum the fruits produced from year 5 to year 10, and assume that the tree does not produce any fruits in the first four years:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now, the length of the red rope is \( 4B \):

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **After Giving Money to Their Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15

3. **Amount Left with Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave \(x = 3\) dollars to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ pods per dollar} \]

Since each pod runs one dishwashing cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   - Number of $20 bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

2. **Losing Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills.
   - Remaining bills = 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. **Paying a Bill**: Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Bills used to pay the bill = 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
   - Remaining bills = 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. **Tripling the Money**: Thomas triples the remaining money.
   - Value of remaining bills = 20 bills * $20 = $400.
   - Tripled value = $400 * 3 = $1200.

5. **Converting to $5 Bills**: Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills.
   - Number of $5 bills = $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.

Therefore, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the length of the chalk after each day and determine how many days it will take for the chalk to become smaller than 2 inches.

1. **Initial Length of Chalk on Monday**: 5 inches
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches
3. **Remaining Chalk on Monday**: 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Starting from Tuesday, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

4. **Chalk Used on Tuesday**: 20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches
5. **Remaining Chalk on Tuesday**: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches

6. **Chalk Used on Wednesday**: 20% of 2.20 inches = 0.20 * 2.20 = 0.44 inches
7. **Remaining Chalk on Wednesday**: 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches

At the end of Wednesday, the remaining length of the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk at the end of Wednesday.

The teacher has to recycle the chalk after **2** more days.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students who are on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
1/3 * 12 girls = 4 girls on varsity.

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
1/4 * 12 boys = 3 boys on varsity.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity.

The total number of students in the class is:
12 girls + 12 boys = 24 students.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27,000, and then divide that number by 3, since the books are to be distributed equally among 3 schools.

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:
   - Cost of 100 books = $500
   - Total money available = $27,000
   - Number of 100-book sets he can buy = $27,000 / $500 = 54 sets
   - Total number of books = 54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books

2. Calculate the number of books per school:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour, which is 5 snowballs every 15 minutes. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, the net increase in the number of snowballs every 15 minutes is:

5 (made) - 2 (melted) = 3 snowballs

To find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net increase per 15-minute interval:

60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:

20 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 300 minutes

Converting 300 minutes into hours:

300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we can work backwards from the information provided.

1. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered 2 bulk packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

   Therefore, the number of bandages at the start of the third day before using any and before the new order was:
   \[
   78 + 25 - 100 = 3
   \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - They did not order any new bandages on the second day.

   Therefore, the number of bandages at the start of the second day before using any was:
   \[
   3 + 28 = 31
   \]

3. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.

   Therefore, the number of bandages at the start of the first day before using any and before the new order was:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, we calculate her earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5 \, \text{per hour} = 67.5 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5 \, \text{per hour} = \$101.25 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
\[ \$101.25 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$405 \]

Next, we add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
- Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total attendance bonus is:
\[ \$10 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$40 \]

Finally, we add her earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
\[ \$405 + \$40 = \$445 \]

"To determine how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, let's break down the information:

- Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors from the palettes.
- She also had 3 makeup sets, each with 6 colors, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors from the makeup sets.
- Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors from the palettes, leaving her with \(8 - 4 = 4\) colors from the palettes.
- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so half of these is \(6 \div 2 = 3\) colors used up.
- Therefore, from the makeup sets, she has \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors left.

Adding the remaining colors from the palettes and the makeup sets, Amy has \(4 + 15 = 19\) eyeshadow colors left.

\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance walked by the last dog, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:

\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. The selling price is 11/8 of the buying price.

The buying price of the magazines is $72. 

The selling price can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Buying Price} \times \frac{11}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated and then find the number of red jelly beans based on his estimate. Finally, we will compare this to the true number of red jelly beans, which is 900.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of jelly beans:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation to represent the total length:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to calculate how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds required for 80 meatballs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total number of meatballs}}{\text{Number of meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can set up the relationships described in the problem with the information given.

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so we can express the number of paintings Shelley has as \( K + 8 \).

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can express the number of paintings Samantha has as \( (K + 8) - 12 \).

Since Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:

\[ (K + 8) - 12 = 27 \]

Solving for \( K \):

\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books each bookcase can hold.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we add up the total number of books each bookcase can hold:
- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total books per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To determine Rose's profit, we need to calculate both her total cost and her total revenue, and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Rose bought five dozens of eggs.
   - Each dozen costs $2.40.
   - Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40 per dozen = $12.00.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Rose bought five dozens of eggs, which is 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.
   - She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs.
   - Number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs = 60 / 3 = 20 sets.
   - Total revenue = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20.00.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

Therefore, Rose's profit is $8.00.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to determine the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide that cost by the number of sticks in the bag.

The original cost of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the cost of the bag after the discount is:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the cost of the bag to cents, since the question asks for the cost per stick in cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

$15.00 * 100 cents/dollar = 1500 cents

There are 30 sticks in the bag, so the cost per stick is:

1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we need to determine how many questions Audrey got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to pass = 77
- Questions already correct = 42
- Questions needed on the second test = 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There is a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people.
   - There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 2 * 8 (for rooms)
   - Total flashlights = 4 + 16
   - Total flashlights = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 4 small candles for half the rooms and 5 medium candles for the other half.
   - Half of the 8 rooms is 4 rooms.
   - Total small candles = 4 candles/room * 4 rooms
   - Total small candles = 16
   - Total medium candles = 5 candles/room * 4 rooms
   - Total medium candles = 20
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20
   - Total candles = 36

"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to travel the distance on land and in water separately, and then sum these times.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time for each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**: 
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we sum the times to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM.**

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas originally had before dropping any. Dallas ends up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, so before dropping them, Dallas had:

21 marbles + 4 marbles = 25 marbles

Since Mazie had 52 marbles to start with and gave all of them to the twins, and we know Dallas received 25 of them, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles:

52 marbles - 25 marbles = 27 marbles

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

"To determine the force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, including the luggage and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children together weigh 75 pounds each, which totals 150 pounds.

The total weight is:
\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. Therefore, we calculate 1% of 1600 pounds:
\[ 1\% \times 1600 \text{ pounds} = 0.01 \times 1600 \text{ pounds} = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is:
16 pounds"
"To determine how much crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length (\( l \)) = 20 feet
- Width (\( w \)) = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we know both of their ages, we can find the average:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in one day and then for one week.

1. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day, so each pig eats:
   \( 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \)

2. Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total daily consumption for all pigs is:
   \( 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \)

3. To find the total consumption for one week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
   \( 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \)

4. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is:
   \( 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \)

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since each of the 20 guests will eat 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs

John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so the additional number of hot dogs he needs to buy is:

40 hot dogs needed - 4 hot dogs already have = 36 hot dogs

Since hot dogs come in packs of 6, we need to determine how many packs of 6 hot dogs John needs to buy to get at least 36 hot dogs. We divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the hot dogs is:

6 packs * $2/pack = $12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron. Therefore, Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did.
   - Aaron's distance = 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - If Aaron's speed is 1/8 miles per minute, then Vanessa's speed is half of that.
   - Vanessa's speed = (1/8) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

4. **Determine the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how much new line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, the total required line is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line/foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

"To calculate the weekly revenue from reservations at Tom's restaurant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of a single reservation.
2. Calculate the total revenue per night.
3. Calculate the total revenue for the week based on the number of days the restaurant is open.

Step 1: Total cost of a single reservation
- Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.
- Total cost per reservation = (2 meals * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15

Step 2: Total revenue per night
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- Total revenue per night = 6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90

Step 3: Total revenue for the week
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- Total weekly revenue = 2 days * $90 per night = $180

Therefore, the total revenue Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:

$180"
"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the total profit:**
   The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   \[ \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   The total selling price is the total cost plus the profit.
   \[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   The total selling price is divided by the number of watermelons.
   \[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19 years old. Since James is 18 years old, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Difference = Number of oranges Ana peels - Number of oranges Jane peels
- Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

1. **Cost of the radiator after discount:**
   - Original price of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of the mechanic's labor:**
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of the labor
   - Total cost = \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
