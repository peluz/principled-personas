"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times \$80,000 = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000
   \]

2. Calculate the new value of the house:
   \[
   \text{New value} = \text{Original value} + \text{Increase in value} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including repairs:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Original purchase price} + \text{Cost of repairs} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
   \]

4. Calculate the profit:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000
   \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[
\$70,000

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

He runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So for each session, he runs:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:

180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, the total meters James runs a week is:

540"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day for her flock of 20 chickens.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, for 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to account for the feed already given during the morning and afternoon meals. Wendi gives:
- 15 cups in the morning
- 25 cups in the afternoon

The total amount of feed given by the end of the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for Kylar's purchase, we need to consider the pricing structure: every first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

1. For every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 (for the first glass) + $3 (for the second glass) = $8.
2. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide this number by 2 to find out how many pairs he is buying: 16 / 2 = 8 pairs.
3. The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken for Carla to download the 200 GB file, considering the interruption and the need to restart the download.

1. **Calculate the time taken to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Add the time taken for the Windows update:**
   - The update takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the entire file again:**
   - Since the download restarts from the beginning, the time to download the full 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \) minutes.

4. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Time to download 40% of the file: 40 minutes
   - Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
   - Time to download the full file again: 100 minutes
   - Total time: \( 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 \) minutes

The total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled away from home and then subtract the distance he traveled back towards home.

1. **Distance traveled away from home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Distance traveled back towards home:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total distance traveled back towards home:**
   - Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Net distance from home:**
   - Net distance = Distance away from home - Distance back towards home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

John is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. First month: 60 downloads.
2. Second month: The number of downloads is three times the first month, so \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \) downloads.
3. Third month: The number of downloads is reduced by 30% from the second month. A 30% reduction means the program retains 70% of the second month's downloads. So, \( 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \) downloads.

Now, we add the downloads from all three months together:
\( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \)

366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Income from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Income} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost:
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.

3. After selling at the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

6. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, the remaining vacuum cleaners after the orange house can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 20
2. **Percentage enrolled in contemporary dance**: 20%

First, calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, determine the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

3. **Percentage of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance**: 25%

Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, determine the number of students remaining after those enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that this represents:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the entire class enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both jobs and then multiply by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings from teaching = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from cheerleading coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings from coaching = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
- Total weekly earnings = $700/week + $450/week = $1150/week

Finally, to find her annual salary, we multiply her total weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year:
- Annual salary = Total weekly earnings * Number of weeks worked per year
- Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Solving for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance to be covered is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the remaining distance and time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum these amounts after accounting for the spill.

First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
- \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the amounts of water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Total water = 6 liters (from the orange drink) + 9 liters (from the pineapple drink) = 15 liters.

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age of Raymond when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old and that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's current age is:

31 (Samantha's age) + 6 (years older than Samantha) = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago this was, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

37 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when his son was born) = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and then subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk at $3 each is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples at $1.50 each is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 (total) - $33 (other items) = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means that for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 units. Together, these units add up to 162, which is their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The equation for their total age is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combine like terms:
\[18x = 162\]

Solve for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age = \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age = \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to determine what each friend guessed.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = 80 \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S = 40 \)), we can find the number of gold coins (\( G \)):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 1 point more than the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both periods to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Total points scored: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. After selling them, he uses the money to buy video games and has $5 left over. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine if he sold all of them or not.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games he buys:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is:
$160 (cost of video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

Since the total amount of money John had after selling his lego sets is $195 and he spent $165, this means he did indeed sell all his lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
0

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week.

- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed and use it to find her running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.
   - Therefore, running speed = 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running speed is four times faster than walking speed.
   - Therefore, walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = 1/3 of 6 hours = 2 hours.
   - Time spent walking = 2/3 of 6 hours = 4 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed * time spent running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed * time spent walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we first need to calculate the total number of pie pieces Grandma Jones initially had. Since she baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

40 pieces - 14 pieces remaining = 26 pieces taken

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We know that one serving of chips is 250 calories and the 300g bag has 5 servings. Therefore, each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since 250 calories are in 60g of chips, we can calculate how many grams of chips 200 calories would be:

(200 calories / 250 calories) * 60g = 48g

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she originally had from the total to find out how many were in the package.

Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using 220, so the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:

220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243 (total before using)

Candice originally had 80 Post-it notes in her purse, so the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

243 (total before using) - 80 (originally had) = 163 (in the package)

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to get the total amount spent on ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly income by multiplying the daily income by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12.
252 eggs/day ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozens/day

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens/day × $2/dozen = $42/day

Step 3: Weekly income
To find the weekly income, we multiply the daily income by 7.
$42/day × 7 days/week = $294/week

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he travels is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back the same distance at a rate of 6 miles per hour. The time taken to travel back is given by:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 pounds * (2 toys/pound) = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones including the interest, and then divide that total by the number of months in the installment plan.

1. First, calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest:
   \( 5 \text{ phones} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} = \$750 \)

2. Next, calculate the total interest for all the phones:
   \( 2\% \text{ interest} \times \$750 = 0.02 \times \$750 = \$15 \)

3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid:
   \( \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \)

4. Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months in the installment plan to find the monthly payment:
   \( \$765 \div 3 \text{ months} = \$255 \)

Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level, starting from the top and working our way down.

Given that the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Number of levels = 4

Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 365 days and then divide that by the number of cups in one bag.

1. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
   - 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

2. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining days of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days):
   - 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

3. Add the amounts from both periods to get the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
   - 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

4. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed, given that each bag contains 110 cups:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, David does:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, Raymond does:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water:
   \[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:
   \[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

3. The boy received 6 liters of water.

4. Now, add the water received by the girls and the boy to find the total amount of water used:
   \[ \text{Total water used} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

5. Subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find the amount of water left:
   \[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water left is 10 liters.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L \), we can find \( W \):

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive over these years, starting from the point where she has already completed five years of service.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7200

Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she is eligible for her first 10% salary increase.

3. **First Salary Increase (after 5 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $600 + ($600 * 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660
   - New Annual Salary: $660 * 12 = $7920

After the first year of the three-year period (6 years of service), she will receive another 10% increase.

4. **Second Salary Increase (after 6 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $660 + ($660 * 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726
   - New Annual Salary: $726 * 12 = $8712

After the second year of the three-year period (7 years of service), she will receive another 10% increase.

5. **Third Salary Increase (after 7 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $726 + ($726 * 10%) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
   - New Annual Salary: $798.60 * 12 = $9583.20

After the third year of the three-year period (8 years of service), she will receive another 10% increase.

6. **Fourth Salary Increase (after 8 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $798.60 + ($798.60 * 10%) = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

"To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed based on the attendance.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend. Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of attendees will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of gift bags needed.
Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest. Therefore, the number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 10 \text{ lbs/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ lbs} \).

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \text{ lbs/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ lbs} \).

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad needed = \( 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \).

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

4. Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The total number of boys is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 200 students:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
   \]

2. The total number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

3. The number of girls in the Girl Scouts is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the total number of girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
   \]

4. The number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is the total number of girls minus the number of girls in the Girl Scouts:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40
   \]

So, the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is 40.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

Since the sauce loses half its volume when cooked, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of the tomatoes was:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total original volume by the volume of one can:

\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains three tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left in the line is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time based on the rate at which the fog bank moves and the distance it needs to cover.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the fog bank's movement is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

The city is 42 miles across. To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover 42 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times 3.3333 \]
\[ \text{Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total time he spent watching TV each night and then solve for the unknown.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \(x\) 30-minute episodes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water and the ratio of sugar to water.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. To find out how many of these 120 parts are teaspoons of sugar, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Where \( x \) is the number of teaspoons of sugar. Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{7}{20} \times 120

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than what he was making four years ago.
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \).
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 40,000 + 16,000 \).
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \).
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \).
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary.
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 \).
   - Total salary = \( 99,076.92 \).

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. Julia had 12 spoons when setting the table.

We need to find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

The total number of spoons Julia had before setting the table can be calculated as follows:
- Spoons from Julia's package: \( x \)
- Spoons from her husband's package: 5
- Total spoons before using any: \( x + 5 \)

Since Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew, the number of spoons left for setting the table is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation for \( W \):
  \[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we have \( Q \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much he would earn if he worked those hours instead.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. If he worked the 14 hours he usually spends gaming, his earnings would be:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first identify which items are nonfood and then apply the 10% tax to those items. The food items are milk and eggs, and the nonfood items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the nonfood items:
10% of $10 = $1

The total cost of the nonfood items including tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items including tax:
$5 + $11 = $16

The total cost for everything is $16.

"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine his total expenses and subtract them from his total income.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of bleach per client: 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4
- Cost of cloths per client: 1 pack * $5/pack = $5
- Total cost per client: $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- Total expenses: 8 clients * $9/client = $72

Kim's total income is given as $92.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest: John has 10 hectares of land, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
   \( 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \)

2. Determine the number of harvests in a year: Since John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests per year is:
   \( 12 \text{ months/year} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \)

3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year: Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year:
   \( 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \)

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. This means the bees that left in the first 6 hours (30 bees) and the bees that left in the third 6-hour period (60 bees) minus the bees that returned in the second 6-hour period (15 bees) will return.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \]

Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received to this amount.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.

The total cost for 1 adult and 1 child ticket is:
$12 (adult ticket) + $10 (child ticket) = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
$22 (total cost of tickets) + $8 (change) = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance to home in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance to home in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home.

Steve's time to get home:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time to get home:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time between the two is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar).

500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to find the original number of fries in the pack.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before the ants**: The ants carried off 1 fry, so before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Before the raccoon**: The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, meaning one-third of the fries were left. If 6 fries represent one-third, then the total number of fries before the raccoon took any was \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
4. **Before the pigeons**: The three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. Before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Before the seagull**: The seagull ate half the amount that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. Before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. **Initial state**: Dave ate 14 fries, so before he ate any, the pack contained \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

Therefore, the original number of fries in the pack was 48.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on each type of day:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**: Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long.
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays**: Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long.
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all the days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total class hours for the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase rate:**
   - Initial price of the bag of marbles: $20
   - Increase rate: 20% of the original price every two months

2. **Determine the number of price increases over 36 months:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases in 36 months is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

3. **Calculate the price after each increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, which is \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, each increase adds $4 to the original price.

4. **Calculate the total increase over 18 periods:**
   - Total increase = \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the final price:**
   - Final price = Initial price + Total increase
   - Final price = \( 20 + 72 = 92 \) dollars.

However, this approach assumes a linear increase, but the problem states that the price increases by 20% of the original price, not the current price. This means the price increases by a fixed amount of $4 every two months, which is a linear increase, not a compound one.

Thus, the final price after 36 months is:

   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the toys:
- Total cost of red cars = $20
- Total cost of action figures = $15
- Total cost of the doll = $15

Total value of all toys = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

   - The profit formula is: \( \text{Profit} = R - C \).
   - Given the profit is $25, we have: \( 25 = R - C \).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, totaling $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total cost \( C \) is then \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - The revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - The total revenue \( R \) is then \( 10G \).

4. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( R \) and \( C \) into the profit equation: \( 25 = 10G - 5G \).
   - Simplify: \( 25 = 5G \).
   - Solve for \( G \): \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is $15.

"To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race. Since there were 240 Asians in total and 80 of them were Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 (Chinese)

Out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 were boys. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

160 (Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, let's break down his monthly expenses step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to family} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the final remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have 350 dollars.

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours at the same rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. According to the problem, the 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( C \).

Given:
\[ 200 = 5C \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. The problem also states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

Given:
\[ R = 4C \]

Substituting the value of \( C \):

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, we need to find out how old Jan was two years ago:
- Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Next, we use the information that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time:
- Half of Jan's age two years ago = 28 / 2 = 14 years.
- Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5 = 19 years.

Now, we need to find out how old Mark is now:
- Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years.

Finally, we use the information that Jean is two years older than Mark:
- Jean's current age = 21 + 2 = 23 years.

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Team A (Well-Rounded Team):**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for Team A = 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

**Team B (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first event is 2 times more likely than the second event.
   - To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
     \[
     (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

Thus, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.
2. The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
3. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
4. There is a pen of rabbits, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits:

- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 cages of hamsters, so the total number of pieces of straw for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.
- The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw.

So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces.

Next, subtract the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw to find out how much straw is given to the rats:

- Total straw given to the rats is \(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is \(90 \div 6 = 15\) rats.

Finally, since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 2\% = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Plugging in the values:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost of buying the bags is \( 20x \) dollars (since each bag costs $20).

The cost of transporting the bags is \( 2x \) dollars (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 30x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 30x - 22x = 8x \]

We know the trader made a total profit of $400:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: $20.25 for 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend pays:
$102 / 3 = $34

Each friend paid $34.

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees Tom plants each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees.

Step 1: Net number of trees planted each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees he adds each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, and adding 8 trees each year for 10 years, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Final number of trees
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. According to the information provided, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. Therefore, the cost of one pen is:

\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times the initial number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards she has:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards collected in the first month: 60

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we add the earnings from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93:
- The formula for the average is: (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)
- We want the average of the five highest scores to be 93.
- Therefore, the total score needed for the five highest scores is: 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we need to find the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
- Scores (excluding the lowest score of 71): 89, 92, 100, 86
- Sum of these scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. The sum of the five highest scores (including the sixth test score) should be 465:
- 367 + \( x \) = 465
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 465 - 367 = 98
  \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

1. For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides \(125 \times 4 = 500\) kilometers.

2. For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides \(120 \times 3 = 360\) kilometers.

Adding the distances from both periods gives us the total distance:
- Total distance = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20 grams/candied apple = 1600 grams

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000 grams (chocolate bars) + 1600 grams (candied apples) = 2600 grams

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought after all three days, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we add up the cakes bought on each day to find the total:

- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes bought = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 plates * $6000/plate = $36,000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

3. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost of one cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / 240 cups = $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then figure out how much more money she needs after considering her current savings and the money she will earn from babysitting.

1. Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:
   - Jacket: $30
   - 2 pairs of shoes: 2 * $20 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. Calculate the total amount Sara will earn from babysitting:
   - Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time: 4 * $5 = $20

3. Calculate Sara's total savings after babysitting:
   - Initial savings: $10
   - Earnings from babysitting: $20
   - Total savings: $10 + $20 = $30

4. Determine how much more money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes:
   - Total cost: $70
   - Total savings: $30
   - Additional money needed: $70 - $30 = $40

5. Calculate how many times Sara must mow the lawn to earn the additional $40:
   - Earnings per lawn mowed: $4
   - Number of times to mow the lawn: $40 / $4 = 10

Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The number of eggs produced by the red chickens each day is \( 3R \) (since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day), and the number of eggs produced by the white chickens each day is \( 5W \) (since each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day).

The total number of eggs collected each day is the sum of the eggs from the red and white chickens:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length (L) = 6 miles
- Width (W) = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance Gary walks is 15 miles. To find out how long it takes him to walk this distance, we use the formula for time (T), which is:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour, we can calculate the time:

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers (first day) + 50 more customers = 150 customers.
3. Add the number of customers from the first two days: 100 customers (first day) + 150 customers (second day) = 250 customers.
4. The total number of customers by the end of the third day is 500.
5. Subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total by the end of the third day to find the number of customers on the third day: 500 customers (total) - 250 customers (first two days) = 250 customers.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 250.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \ ) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of payments, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, including the 10% interest.

1. Calculate the total amount to be repaid:
   - Principal amount: $2000
   - Interest: 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200
   - Total amount to be repaid: $2000 + $200 = $2200

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Total payments over 12 months: $165 * 12 = $1980

3. Calculate the remaining balance after 12 months:
   - Total amount to be repaid: $2200
   - Total amount paid: $1980
   - Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by all four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, calculate how many points Yuri scored:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, calculate how many points Brianna scored:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points scored by the three: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)
- Points scored by Jojo: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water to water her garden. The amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater collected:
   \[
   30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

"First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

5 - 2 = 3 people

Step 2: Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters he receives each week is:
3 * 2 = 6 letters

Step 3: Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he needs to write in response is:
6 * 5 = 30 pages

Step 4: Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:
30 * 6 = 180 minutes

Step 5: To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
180 / 60 = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly allowance.

1. **Daily calls with the boss**: Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Over 30 days, this amounts to:
   \[
   15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Extra calls**: Jason has also used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total minutes used**: Adding the minutes used for daily calls and extra calls:
   \[
   450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Minutes remaining**: Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. Subtracting the total minutes used from the monthly allowance:
   \[
   1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and in the end, Griffin has 27 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). Therefore, we have:
\[7 + x = 27\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information and setting up the equation.

1. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
3. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \( f \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Step 1: Daily cost
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours each day.
Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500

Step 2: Weekly cost
The makeup is needed 4 times a week.
Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000

Step 3: Total cost for 5 weeks
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
Total cost = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000

Step 4: Apply the 10% discount
The makeup artist gives a 10% discount.
Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Final amount paid by Jean:
Final amount = Total cost - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate on both days and then convert that into calories.

On Monday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days:
- Sue's sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Next, we convert the number of cookies into calories. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
- \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

"To find out how many boys are in the third class, let's break down the information:

1. Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
2. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and 30 girls in total.
3. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).
4. Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).
5. Since each class has 20 students, and the third class has 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cougars killed today:**
   - Rick killed 3 fewer cougars today than he did last night.
   - Last night, Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Therefore, today he killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars.

2. **Determine the number of wolves killed today:**
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today.
   - Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

3. **Calculate the total number of animals killed today:**
   - Today, Rick killed 12 cougars and 36 wolves.
   - Total animals killed today = \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of animals killed last night:**
   - Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
   - Total animals killed last night = \( 10 + 15 = 25 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of animals killed over both nights:**
   - Total animals killed = Animals killed last night + Animals killed today
   - Total animals killed = \( 25 + 48 = 73 \).

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, who went down 30 times.

First, calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 slides:
30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we subtract this number from Mitchel's total:
Anne's slides = 30 - 9 = 21

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:
Robert's slides = 4 * 21 = 84

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys any additional cows. There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows, so the total number of cows initially is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows per stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, each stall will have the original 20 cows plus the 2 new cows:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. 

\[ \text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 \times 400 \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate, which is 30% of the total weight.

\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \]
\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 8000 - 2400 \]
\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first need to calculate the total time in minutes and then convert that to hours.

For the small holes:
30 small holes * 3 minutes per small hole = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
15 large holes * 10 minutes per large hole = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time for both small and large holes:
90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the sum of their current ages, which is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we add 10 years to each of their current ages, which is equivalent to adding 20 years to their combined current age.

So, the calculation is:
20 (current sum of their ages) + 20 (10 years for each person) = 40

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba:**
   - A cobra has 70 spots.
   - A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
   - Therefore, a mamba has \( \frac{70}{2} = 35 \) spots.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras:**
   - There are 40 cobras.
   - Each cobra has 70 spots.
   - Total spots for cobras = \( 40 \times 70 = 2800 \) spots.

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas:**
   - There are 60 mambas.
   - Each mamba has 35 spots.
   - Total spots for mambas = \( 60 \times 35 = 2100 \) spots.

4. **Calculate the combined total number of spots:**
   - Total spots for cobras = 2800
   - Total spots for mambas = 2100
   - Combined total spots = \( 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \) spots.

5. **Find half the number of spots they all have combined:**

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, which gives us:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, which gives us:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together, we have:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, given its speed.

1. First, we find the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]

2. Next, we use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed, to find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of medals given out.
   - Therefore, \( 39 = \frac{T}{10} \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, each child will get:

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we first need to calculate the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

She takes a half-hour pause, so the actual working time is:
180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are:
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"Let's break down the points each player has after the third round and then calculate the points after the fourth round.

After 3 rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, each player with over 20 points gets an extra point:
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year and then multiply that number by the price per book.

First, let's find out how many books Elise has sold in total. We know that there are 50 unsold books out of the original 250, so she has sold:

250 - 50 = 200 books

We also know that she sold 45 books in the current (third) year. So, the number of books sold in the first and second years combined is:

200 - 45 = 155 books

According to the information, Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Since Sandy needs to lose the same total amount of weight as Joey (8 pounds), we can calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds by dividing the total weight to be lost by her weekly weight loss:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find out how many people show up for Martha's party, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which totals:
   \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.

2. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which totals:
   \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

3. Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:
   \(12 + 12 = 24\) people.

4. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so we subtract these from the total:
   \(24 - 8 = 16\) people.

5. 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. This is:
   \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people.

6. Subtracting these 2 people from the 16 who were still expected to come:
   \(16 - 2 = 14\) people.

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14.

"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of marbles Solomon has.
2. Calculate the weight of these marbles.

First, let's find the total number of marbles Solomon has:

- Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
- He already had 50 marbles in the store.
- His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

To find out how many marbles his father gave him:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, add all the marbles together:
\[ 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \]

Next, calculate the total weight of the marbles. Each marble weighs 2 kg, so:
\[ 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg/marble} = 156 \text{ kg} \]

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes and then calculate the total number of boxes needed for both Jam and Meg's pencils.

1. **Determine the number of pencils in each of Jam's boxes:**
   - Jam has a total of 26 pencils, including 2 loose pencils.
   - Therefore, the pencils in the boxes are \(26 - 2 = 24\) pencils.
   - Since these 24 pencils are evenly distributed among 3 boxes, each box contains \(24 \div 3 = 8\) pencils.

2. **Calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:**
   - Jam has 26 pencils.
   - Meg has 46 pencils.
   - Together, they have \(26 + 46 = 72\) pencils.

3. **Determine the number of boxes needed to store all 72 pencils:**

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, the number of ice cubes required is:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube adds 12 milliliters of water to the coffee, so the total amount of water added by the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Water added by ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream. Therefore, the total amount of liquid added to the coffee is:

\[ \text{Total liquid added} = 60 \text{ milliliters (from ice cubes)} + 15 \text{ milliliters (cream)} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Monthly salary of each junior programmer = $2000.
   - Total monthly salary for junior programmers = 40 \times 2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   - Number of senior programmers = 60.
   - Monthly salary of each senior programmer = $2400.
   - Total monthly salary for senior programmers = 60 \times 2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:**
   - Total monthly salary for all programmers = Total monthly salary for junior programmers + Total monthly salary for senior programmers.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second stop, there were 20 people on the bus:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( H = 2C \) (twice as many chickens as cows)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, let's break down each activity and its duration:

- Monday: 1 hour of yoga
- Tuesday: Cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga, so 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours
- Wednesday: Half-hour cheese-tasting event, so 0.5 hours
- Thursday: Museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class, so 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours of errands

Now, add up all the hours:

1 (yoga) + 3 (cooking) + 0.5 (cheese-tasting) + 1.5 (museum) + 2 (errands) = 8 hours

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she donates and then subtract that from the number of plant pots she originally bought.

1. The school asks for 30 plant pots for the daisies.
2. They ask for twice as many for the roses, which means 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.
3. The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.
4. April originally bought 100 plant pots.
5. The number of plant pots left over is 100 (original) - 90 (donated) = 10 plant pots.

"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to determine how much money she had left after buying the sweater and giving her brother some money. 

First, we calculate the total amount of money Andrea spent and gave away:
- She spent $11 on a sweater.
- She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is:
\[ 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Andrea started with $36. To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount spent and given away from her initial amount:
\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

Therefore, Andrea saved $21.

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on his vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows at 2 hours each) is 30% of his total vacation time.

First, calculate the total time spent watching shows:
3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

Since this is 30% of his total vacation time, we can set up the equation:
6 hours = 30% of total time
6 hours = 0.30 * total time

To find the total time, we divide both sides by 0.30:
Total time = 6 hours / 0.30
Total time = 20 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his total time was spent sightseeing. We can calculate the time spent sightseeing as follows:
Time spent sightseeing = 40% of total time
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * 20 hours
Time spent sightseeing = 8 hours

So, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.

"To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we first need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then add this to her current savings. After that, we can subtract this total from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs.

1. Calculate earnings from the first job:
   - Earnings from the first job = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200

2. Calculate earnings from the second job:
   - Earnings from the second job = $5/hour * 15 hours = $75

3. Calculate total earnings from both jobs:
   - Total earnings = $200 + $75 = $275

4. Calculate total savings after adding her current savings:
   - Total savings = $80 (current savings) + $275 (total earnings) = $355

5. Calculate how much more she needs to save:
   - Amount needed = $400 (cost of the phone) - $355 (total savings) = $45

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, let's first determine the heights of the other two trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so its height is:
2 * 17 feet = 34 feet

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person (Morgan) to participate in all the activities and then see how many friends can join within the $90 budget.

1. **Cost for one person:**
   - Mini-golf: $5
   - Arcade tokens: $5
   - Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

   Total cost for one person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

2. **Total budget: $90**

3. **Number of people (including Morgan) that can be accommodated:**
   - Total budget / Cost per person = $90 / $30 = 3

Since the total number of people is 3, and this includes Morgan, the number of friends she can invite is:

3 - 1 = 2

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply by 5.

First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day:
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops.
- Total cost of lollipops per day = 4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents = $1.00

Next, we determine how much money she saves each day:
- Marisa gets $5.00 as pocket money each day.
- She spends $1.00 on lollipops.
- Daily savings = $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

Now, we calculate her total savings over 5 days:
- Daily savings = $4.00
- Total savings over 5 days = $4.00/day * 5 days = $20.00

So, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:

$20.00"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the gumballs:**
   Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying gumballs must be twice the cost of the gumballs.
   \[
   \text{Total change before buying gumballs} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how much money Billy spent on candy:**
   Billy started with $10 and had $4 left as change after buying candy.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on candy} = 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   The candy costs $1.50 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Number of pounds of candy} = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day, and finally determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city back to the first city:
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second and then to the third is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles, which is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   - The total distance for one trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   - The train makes 3 trips a day, so the total distance in one day is 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.

4. Determine how many days the train can operate before needing service:
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so the number of days before service is 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total amount of interest she will owe over the five months. The formula to calculate simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Rate (R) = 10% per year, which is 0.10 per year
- Time (T) = 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year

First, calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 152.50 \]

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount to be repaid:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50 \]

Since Karan has to pay this amount over 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5 to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the amount of land left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's calculate the right side of the equation:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26 girls

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing, and half of them can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls performing = 26 / 2 = 13 girls

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha and then compare the costs.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ride ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs 2 * $2 = $4.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is 9 * $4 = $36.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30

The amount David saves is the difference between Dasha's total cost and David's total cost:
$36 - $30 = $6

Therefore, David saves $6.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to determine how many popsicles each of them has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:

\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract this from the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix**: $10 per month.
2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**:
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the discount is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
   - With a 20% discount, the savings on the bundle is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the discounted cost for the bundle is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services**:
   - Netflix: $10
   - Hulu and Disney Plus bundle: $16
   - Total: $10 + $16 = $26 per month.

4. **Savings**:
   - Cost of cable package: $60 per month.
   - Cost of streaming services: $26 per month.
   - Savings: $60 - $26 = $34 per month.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing her song, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Next, we add up all the time spent on these activities to get the total work time:
Total work time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

"To find out how many books Wendy needs, we first need to determine the number of books that can be placed in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. This is simply the product of the number of rows and the number of columns:

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number. So we first double the number of books:

2 * 36 books = 72 books

Then we add 20 more books to this number:

72 books + 20 books = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, let's break down the information:

1. Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
3. The total number of cards Erica had initially is 20 (made) + 30 (pre-made) = 50 cards.
4. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she passed out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
5. After passing out 29 cards, she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.
6. She received 17 cards from family and friends, so the total number of cards she now has is 21 (remaining) + 17 (received) = 38 cards.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pizza has 12 slices in total.
2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since 1/3 of 12 is 4, Bill gets 4 slices.
3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since 1/4 of 12 is 3, Mark gets 3 slices.
4. Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away and eaten:
- Slices given to Bill: 4
- Slices given to Mark: 3
- Slices eaten by Jenny: 2

Total slices given away and eaten: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9

Finally, subtract the total slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:
12 - 9 = 3

So, the number of slices left is 3.

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save to buy the bike, we first need to determine how much more money he needs. The bike costs $300, and Mark already has $50 in his bank account.

The additional amount needed is:
$300 - $50 = $250

Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to save $250, we divide the total amount needed by his daily earnings:

$250 / $10/day = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days.

"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, let's break down the information given:

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders. So, the number of millipedes is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).
3. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ 90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168 \]

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner before the reduction.
2. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner after the reduction.
3. Find the difference in daily energy usage.
4. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days (30) to find the total savings over the period.

Step 1: Daily energy usage before reduction
The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. If it is used for 8 hours a day, the daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Step 2: Daily energy usage after reduction
If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]
The new daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Step 3: Daily energy savings
The difference in daily energy usage is:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Step 4: Total energy savings over 30 days
To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
\[ 4500 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]
The total savings over 30 days is:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

Therefore, the total energy saved in 30 days is:

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are a total of 4 zebras. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 / 4 = 22\]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people.

Each muffaletta sandwich serves 4 people and requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 20 people, Tyson would need:

- Meat: \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \)
- Cheese: \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \)

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson would need:

- Meat: \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \)
- Cheese: \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \)

Next, we calculate the cost for the meat and cheese:

- Cost of meat: \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \)
- Cost of cheese: \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \)

Finally, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:

- Total cost: \( \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \)

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, let's account for the additional items Allan bought:

3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he bought is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, let's find the new total number of corns:

5. The new total number of corns is \(80 + 60 = 140\).

Finally, we add the new totals of corns and cannolis to find the combined total:

6. The combined total is \(140 + 100 = 240\).

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the payments from May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a typical month)

Total payment for May:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \]
\[ = 40 \times 15 \times 40 \times 4 \]
\[ = 96,000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees in June:
\[ 40 \times \frac{3}{4} = 30 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in June: 4 (assuming a typical month)

Total payment for June:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \]
\[ = 30 \times 15 \times 40 \times 4 \]

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of Purchases:**
   - Total cost for taffy: $4.50
   - Total cost for seashells: $1.50
   - Total cost for magnets: $1.00

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- 80% of $1200 is $1200 * 0.80 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.

"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon will eat in 30 days.
2. Determine how many dozens of cookies this total represents.

First, we know that Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. Over 30 days, the total number of cookies she will eat is:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cookies into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. We know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are expected to explode. Out of the candles that are more dangerous (the 1% that can explode), 5% have the additional defect of smelling like wet dog.

First, let's find out how many candles are expected to explode:

1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 candles also have the defect of smelling like wet dog:

5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles are expected to both explode and smell like wet dog.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Joanne's apples} + \text{Sister's apples} = 500 \]
\[ (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]
\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To find out how many kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. For the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day:
   \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \)

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled over the first four days:
   \( 30\% \times 800 \, \text{km} = 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \)

3. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is:
   \( 0 \, \text{km} \)

4. During the second week (7 days), he made 300 kilometers every day:
   \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \)

Now, we add up all the distances:
\( 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \)

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can solve for Zack's locker size:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Multiplying both sides by 4 to solve for Zack's locker size:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can set up another equation:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Substituting the size of Zack's locker:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for Timothy's locker size:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the ledge where the comb landed. Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. 

The elevation of the comb after falling is:
10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, he needs to climb to 6,000 feet. The distance Oliver must climb is:
6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital now, we need to add the amounts he received from the two banks to his initial capital.

1. The first bank gave him $4000.
2. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
3. His initial capital was $5000.

Adding these amounts together:

$4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) + $5000 (initial capital) = $17000

So, Mr. Josue's total capital now is $17000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.
3. After the boats have carried away 20 cats, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats.
4. Then, \(3/5\) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is \(3/5 \times 30 = 18\) cats.
5. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock after some ran after the mouse is \(30 - 18 = 12\) cats.

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. **Remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   2 years = 24 months
   24 months - 6 months (first period) - 8 months (second period) = 10 months
   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs of each item she ordered:

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup:
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 25\% \times \text{Cost of bagel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find the cost of the cake:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is the number of cards he sells multiplied by the price per card, which is $1.5.

The money from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $150. We can set up the equation:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially preparing for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. This means he prepared for 18 guests to have two hot dogs and the other 18 guests to have one hot dog.
3. The total number of hot dogs prepared is:
   - 18 guests * 2 hot dogs each = 36 hot dogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hot dog each = 18 hot dogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs

4. However, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hot dog. This means each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hot dogs.
5. The total number of hot dogs needed for 40 guests, each having 2 hot dogs, is:
   - 40 guests * 2 hot dogs each = 80 hot dogs

6. The caterer only had 54 hot dogs, so the number of hot dogs short is:
   - 80 - 54 = 26 hot dogs

7. Since each guest who did not get a second hot dog is missing 1 hot dog, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 26.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost.

The amount she pays is 80% of $165.00, which is:
0.80 * $165.00 = $132.00.

So, the final cost of her order is $132.00.

   \[
   \text{Bernadette's travel time} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the time difference needed for Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:** 
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Calculate the total time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) (since his travel time is 4 minutes).
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \).

5. **Determine the difference in their departure times:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \).
   - Bernadette leaves at \( T - 21 \).
   - The difference in their departure times is:
     \[
     (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 21 - 4 = 17 \text{ minutes}

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- The area of the room is 360 square feet.
- The length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

Now, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is $20 for the movie and one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra, making it $21 in total.

If you buy the movie ticket for $12 and the soda for $3, and you save $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda should be $2 less than $21, which is $19.

So, the equation for the total cost without the super ticket is:
\[ 12 + \text{popcorn price} + 3 = 19 \]

Solving for the popcorn price:
\[ 15 + \text{popcorn price} = 19 \]
\[ \text{popcorn price} = 19 - 15 \]
\[ \text{popcorn price} = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

Thus, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:
- At 60 mph for 2 hours, the distance is \(60 \times 2 = 120\) miles.
- At 30 mph for 1 hour, the distance is \(30 \times 1 = 30\) miles.

Next, add these distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 + 30 = 150\) miles.

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = \(150 / 3 = 50\) mph.

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples one person eats in 30 days.
2. Multiply that number by 2, since there are two people (Marin and Nancy).

First, we know that each person eats 4 apples a day. So, in 30 days, one person will eat:
4 apples/day * 30 days = 120 apples

Since there are two people, we multiply the number of apples one person eats in 30 days by 2:
120 apples * 2 = 240 apples

So, Marin and Nancy together eat 240 apples in 30 days.

"To find out how much the potting soil will cost Bob, we need to calculate the total volume of soil required and then determine the cost based on the volume and price per bag.

First, calculate the volume of one raised bed:
\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = 2 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, determine how many bags of potting soil are needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Volume per bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Finally, calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of each color of card.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: There are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:
   \[
   15 \times 0.60 = 9
   \]
   \[
   15 + 9 = 24
   \]
   So, there are 24 green cards.
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
   \[
   15 + 24 = 39
   \]
   So, there are 39 yellow cards.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 0.35 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 35\% \]

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:

- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

Next, we determine how many trips are needed to transport 4500 pounds of feed with a truck that can carry 2250 pounds at a time:

- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, the weekly earnings from cans are 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, the weekly earnings from bottles are 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Now, let's add the weekly earnings from cans and bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

Finally, to find the earnings for a four-week month, we multiply the total weekly earnings by 4:
- Monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

So, Toni has 10 plants + 6 plants = 16 plants.

Next, we find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 plants - 7 plants = 9 plants

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are the ones she gives to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we divide the number of cards by 10 to find the number of students:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 45 \) cents.
- Convert 45 cents to dollars: \( 45 \) cents = \( 0.45 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 50 \) cents.
- Convert 50 cents to dollars: \( 50 \) cents = \( 0.50 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is \( 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \) dollar.
- The final cost for Kelly is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, calculate how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Kelly paid \( 9 \) dollars.
- Becky paid \( 8 \) dollars.
- The difference is \( 9 - 8 = 1 \) dollar.

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for all horses is \(4 \text{ horses} \times 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The total daily consumption is 40 pounds.
   - Over 5 days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The total consumption is 200 pounds.
   - Therefore, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

The cost of the small pizza is $8. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:

Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * Cost of small pizza
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8
Cost of family-size pizza = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends:

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

So, Sally spends $32 in all.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Razors Without Discount:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost of 2 packs:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Cost Per Razor:**
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

6. **Convert to Cents:**
   - \$0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on the next level
- 2 cheerleaders on the next level
- 1 cheerleader at the top

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th is 60 inches tall, the shortest girl (60 inches) will be at the top.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders, each standing on the shoulders of the ones below them. Since the height of each level is the height of the cheerleader standing on the shoulders of the ones below, we can simply add the heights of the cheerleaders.

The calculation is:
- 4 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches
- 3 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches
- 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches
- 1 cheerleader at 60 inches: \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches

Adding these together:
\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636\] inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636 \div 12 = 53\] feet

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day, and each ride costs $6.
- The cost for one day of morning rides is $6 * 1 = $6.
- Over 14 days, the total cost for morning rides is $6 * 14 = $84.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day, and each ride costs $2.
- The cost for one day of afternoon rides is $2 * 1 = $2.
- Over 14 days, the total cost for afternoon rides is $2 * 14 = $28.

Now, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = $84 + $28 = $112

Therefore, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Now, let's find out the total number of oranges they have together:

50 oranges (Ashley) + 70 oranges (Brianne) = 120 oranges

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by three:

120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

So, they can make 40 Greek orange pies.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.
4. Together, they found 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + \frac{B}{2} + \left(\frac{B}{2} + 7\right) = 43
   \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[
B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
B + B + 7 = 43
\]

\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
2B = 36
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David and Lily found:

- David found \( \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) insects.
- Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

This means they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together. Now, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply 364 by 3/4:

364 * 3/4 = 364 * 0.75 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

2. For the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
   3 friends * 2 gifts per friend = 6 gifts

3. Cherrie also buys 10 more random gifts.

Now, we add all the gifts together:
10 gifts (for the first 2 friends) + 6 gifts (for the other 3 friends) + 10 random gifts = 26 gifts

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs were strawberry flavored.
3. One pack was grape flavored, which cost $2.
4. One pack was green apple flavored, which cost half as much as the grape pack, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.
5. The total cost for all the gum was $7.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberry packs. We know the total cost and the cost of the grape and green apple packs:

Total cost = Cost of strawberry packs + Cost of grape pack + Cost of green apple pack
$7 = (2 × Cost of one strawberry pack) + $2 + $1

Let's solve for the cost of one strawberry pack:

$7 = 2 × Cost of one strawberry pack + $3
$7 - $3 = 2 × Cost of one strawberry pack
$4 = 2 × Cost of one strawberry pack
Cost of one strawberry pack = $4 / 2
Cost of one strawberry pack = $2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then see how many of each he can buy with his $24.

First, let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
  - Sticks per dollar for 2 x 4: \( \frac{200 \text{ sticks}}{4 \text{ dollars}} = 50 \text{ sticks per dollar} \)

- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.
  - Sticks per dollar for 2 x 8: \( \frac{400 \text{ sticks}}{6 \text{ dollars}} \approx 66.67 \text{ sticks per dollar} \)

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides more sticks per dollar, it is the more cost-effective option. However, the question asks for the most sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24:
- Cost of one 2 x 4 piece of wood: $4
- Number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy: \( \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars per piece}} = 6 \text{ pieces} \)

Next, we calculate the total number of sticks he can get from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood:
- Sticks per 2 x 4 piece: 200
- Total sticks from 6 pieces: \( 6 \text{ pieces} \times 200 \text{ sticks per piece} = 1200 \text{ sticks} \)

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs and the cost per pair.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs.
Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs.
Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of a weekly bus pass is $20.00. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ 2.00 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cows on the farm**: The farm has 30 cows.
2. **Cows on the zoo**: The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Therefore, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
3. **Sheep on the zoo**: The zoo has 20 sheep.
4. **Sheep on the farm**: The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Therefore, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo:

- **Total animals on the farm**: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- **Total animals on the zoo**: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

1. Determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal.
2. Calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Divide the total number of calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.**

- December 31st to January 1st: 1 day
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Adding these together: 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs.**

- 1 pound = 3500 calories
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.**

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by using the first equation:

\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, the remaining problems are:
   100 - 12 = 88 problems.

3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Since he did 12 problems on Monday, on Tuesday he completes:
   3 * 12 = 36 problems.
   The remaining problems after Tuesday are:
   88 - 36 = 52 problems.

4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, he completes:
   1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.
   The remaining problems after Wednesday are:
   52 - 13 = 39 problems.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"Let's break down the picking rates for each person:

- Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the total quarts picked per hour by all four:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to start with the total number of loaves baked and then subtract the number of loaves sold and add the number of loaves returned.

1. Total loaves baked: 200
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93
3. Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
4. Loaves returned: 6

First, calculate the total number of loaves sold:
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Next, subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (baked) - 132 (sold) = 68 loaves remaining

Finally, add the number of loaves returned:
68 (remaining) + 6 (returned) = 74 loaves

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left.

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to figure out how many cups of raisins she will allocate to the oatmeal cookies.

Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. She wants to divide the raisins equally among three uses: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. Therefore, each use will get:

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find the number of batches, we divide the total cups of raisins for cookies by the amount needed per batch:

9 cups / (3/4 cup per batch) = 9 cups * (4/3 batches per cup) = 12 batches

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate the total cost of electricity for both scenarios and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the weekly cost before adding the new device:**
   - Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
   - Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
   - Daily cost: \( 12 \text{ kW} \times 1.50 \text{ USD/kW} = 18 \text{ USD} \)
   - Weekly cost: \( 18 \text{ USD/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 126 \text{ USD} \)

2. **Calculate the weekly cost after adding the new device:**
   - New daily consumption: \( 12 \text{ kW} + 2 \text{ kW} = 14 \text{ kW} \)
   - Daily cost: \( 14 \text{ kW} \times 1.50 \text{ USD/kW} = 21 \text{ USD} \)
   - Weekly cost: \( 21 \text{ USD/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ USD} \)

3. **Calculate the difference in weekly cost:**
   - Difference: \( 147 \text{ USD} - 126 \text{ USD} = 21 \text{ USD} \)

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is 21 USD.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since 5 days is for half a house).

2. **Convert the rate to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours.

3. **Determine the combined rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint a house in 240 hours, then 5 people working together can paint 5 times as fast.
   - Therefore, 5 people can paint a house in 240 hours / 5 = 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know the total amount Tom spent and the cost of one CD.

The total amount spent is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. The cost of the headphone set can be calculated by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount spent:

Cost of headphone set = Total amount spent - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the amount he spent on the headphone set, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:

Number of additional CDs = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of additional CDs = $44 / $4
Number of additional CDs = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can break down the information given:

- For 5 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, we calculate the total hours for the 5 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours

Next, we calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

Finally, for the 1 week where he worked out 6 hours:
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add all these hours together to get the total:
20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
3. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The number of passengers on the bus now is:
   \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
5. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. So, one-third of 21 is:
   \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The number of passengers on the bus now is:
   \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To find out how much one monitor cost, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer cost $1,100.
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:

Total cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer - Cost of printer
Total cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700
Total cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor would be half of that:

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, one monitor cost $300.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This can be expressed as: \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \).

"To calculate how much you ended up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.
2. Add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount.
3. Since the bill is split evenly, divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each person pays.
4. Add the additional 20% tip that you are paying on top of your half of the bill.

Let's do the math:

1. 20% of $50 is \( 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \) dollars.
2. The total bill including the tip is \( 50 + 10 = 60 \) dollars.
3. Each person pays half of the total bill, so \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \) dollars.
4. You are paying an additional 20% tip on your half of the bill, which is \( 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April**: April has 30 days.
2. **Divide the month into two halves**: The first half of April has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.
3. **Set up the savings equation**: Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Then, in the second half of April, he saves \( 2x \) each day.
4. **Calculate the total savings for the month**:
   - Savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)
   - Total savings: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \)
5. **Set the total savings equal to the target**: \( 45x = 1125 \)
6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and then subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:
- The cost of the apples is 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
- The cost of the oranges is 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
- The cost of the peaches is 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total cost = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

1. **Determine Ray's swimming time for 1 mile in warm water:**
   - When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
   - When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.
   - Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this time gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - In cold water, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - In warm water, Ray swims 1 mile in 34 minutes.

"To find out the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of both the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

You mentioned that you pay $40 for a foot-long fish sub. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:

3 * $40 = $120

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:

$40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160

The total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts: the holes from the buttons with two holes and the holes from the buttons with four holes.

1. First, calculate the number of holes from the seven buttons that each have two holes:
   \( 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \)

2. Next, determine the number of buttons that have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
   \( 21 \text{ buttons} - 7 \text{ buttons} = 14 \text{ buttons} \)

3. Calculate the number of holes from the 14 buttons that each have four holes:
   \( 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \)

4. Finally, add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
   \( 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \)

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. Since she drinks half the daily recommended amount and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks:

\[ \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so:

\[ \text{Juan's current coffee intake} = 10 \times 2 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, the reduction required is:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 20 \text{ cups} - 4 \text{ cups} = 16 \text{ cups} \]

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends (3):
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun moves relative to the ground, not just the pyramid. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid, and it starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

If the sun moves for 10 hours, it will have moved:
5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun starts at 32 degrees from the ground, after 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be:
32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs.

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles needed:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles, so we need to determine how many packs are required:
20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks to get the total:
- Total pages read in two weeks = \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( n \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( n + 7 \) years old.

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ 51 = 3(n + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( n \):

\[ 51 = 3(n + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3n + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3n \]
\[ 30 = 3n \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the payments as follows:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half of $1.00, which is $0.50, for each tooth. So for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the payments:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

"To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days in this period, and he spends an equal amount each day. The total amount of money he has is $70, and he will spend this equally over 7 days, so each day he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Since he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures for 4 days, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of money he has left after buying the wooden action figures:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures, spending the same $10 per day. The total amount spent on plastic action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Finally, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage increase is calculated as:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a desired temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x \) plus 4% of \( x \):

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]

\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve a temperature of 520 degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as follows:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solve for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \( 1.25 \times 5 = 6.25 \) pounds.

2. Weight gain from eating donuts:
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \( 1.75 \times 5 = 8.75 \) pounds.

3. The difference in weight between the two options:
   - The difference is the sum of the weight loss and the weight gain, since one is a negative change and the other is a positive change.
   - The difference is \( 6.25 + 8.75 = 15 \) pounds.

Therefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per day.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week to get the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain twice as much protein:
\[ 3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

Step 3: To find the weekly protein intake, multiply the daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, 5 years ago, Jerry was \( J - 5 \) years old. The problem states that his current age is twice this age:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. The question asks how old Jerry will be in 3 years. Therefore, we add 3 to his current age:

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \), so:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. Here's the breakdown:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total:

200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed of the plane is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. 

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ruiz's production rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's production rate is \( \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

2. **Determine Marissa's production rate:**
   - Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

3. **Calculate the total production for 12 hours:**
   - Ruiz's production in 12 hours: \( 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Marissa's production in 12 hours: \( 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of chocolates made together:**
   - Total production = Ruiz's production + Marissa's production
   - Total production = 720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1800.

"Let's break down Howard's spending over the three days:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up his total spending over the three days:

Total spent = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday
Total spent = $8 + $16 + $64
Total spent = $88

Howard originally had $100, so the amount of money he has left after spending $88 is:

Money left = Original amount - Total spent
Money left = $100 - $88
Money left = $12

So, Howard has $12 left.

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the sales into the two different periods and then sum the earnings from each period.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. The earnings for this period are calculated as follows:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours = $30.00

For the next two hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. The earnings for this period are:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12.00

Adding the earnings from both periods gives us the total earnings:
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo based on Jeremy's monthly driving distance and then find out how many months or years it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity.

1. First, calculate the number of rotations per mile:
   - 725 rotations every 2 miles means 725 / 2 = 362.5 rotations per mile.

2. Next, calculate the number of rotations per month:
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the number of rotations per month is 400 * 362.5 = 145,000 rotations.

3. Determine the total number of months the tire will last:
   - The tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months it will last, divide the total rotations by the monthly rotations: 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months.

4. Convert months to years:
   - 72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years.

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, doubling the number of washes by using 1 pump per wash gives us:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per wash. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, so we divide this cost by the total number of washes:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since the question asks for the cost per pump in cents, we convert $0.10 to cents:

$0.10 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

Now, we know that only 4/5 of these flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. So, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600 to get the speed in kb per hour:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \]

Next, we convert kb per hour to Mb per hour. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:
\[ 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \div 1000 = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in that week, we can break down the week into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
3 days * 10 cars/day = 30 cars

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than 10 each day, which means it pulled 6 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
4 days * 6 cars/day = 24 cars

Now, we add the totals from both parts of the week to get the total number of cars towed for the entire week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the required height from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the required height is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. To find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches, we can set up the following equation:

Current height + (Growth per year * Number of years) = Required height

40 inches + (2 inches/year * Number of years) = 48 inches

We can solve for the number of years:

2 inches/year * Number of years = 48 inches - 40 inches
2 inches/year * Number of years = 8 inches
Number of years = 8 inches / 2 inches/year
Number of years = 4

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.**
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to acquire the cars.**
The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars.
\[ \text{Cost to Acquire} = 250,000 \times 0.30 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**
Profit is the total sales minus the cost to acquire the cars.
\[ \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission.**
James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

So, James made:
\[ 17,500 \]"
"To find out how many men can stay upright on the wave, we first need to determine the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who stay upright are women:

60% of 25 = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 riders - 15 women = 10 men

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel. So, the price of a gold jewel is:
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]
3. The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, the price of a silver jewel is:
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

"To find out how many stamps Max bought in all, let's break down the information given:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, to find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

So, Max bought 45 stamps in all.

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per attended class over $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. The cost per class if he attends all is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per attended class will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per attended class does not exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per attended class is then \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine how many customers Julie can process daily, and then calculate the total for both of them over a week.

1. Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
2. Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so Julie processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers daily.
3. Together, they process 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers daily.
4. Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, let's break down the information given:

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. If we let \(L\) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie's distance can be expressed as \(L + 3\).

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Solving for \(L\):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

$3.30 / 3 oranges = $1.10 per orange

Now, we can calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
Cost of 5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he plans to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular hole can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds can be calculated as:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To calculate Tim's new annual salary after his promotion, we need to consider both his increased monthly salary and the bonus.

1. **Calculate the new monthly salary:**
   - Original monthly salary: $20,000
   - Raise percentage: 5%
   - Raise amount: 5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
   - New monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

2. **Calculate the annual salary from the new monthly salary:**
   - Annual salary from new monthly salary: $21,000 * 12 = $252,000

3. **Calculate the bonus:**
   - Bonus: Half a month's new salary = 0.5 * $21,000 = $10,500

4. **Calculate the total annual income:**

   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to add up the costs of the items Gus did buy and subtract that total from the $20.00 he spent.

The cost of the 2 bags of chips is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.
The cost of the bucket of fried chicken is $8.00.
The cost of the bottle of soda is $1.00.

Now, let's add these costs together: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Gus spent a total of $20.00, so the cost of the apple pie is $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the cooking class and then divide that by the number of hours it takes to learn one recipe.

First, we calculate the total number of hours spent in class:
- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

Total hours = 4 (times per week) * 2 (hours per class) * 6 (weeks) = 48 hours

Next, we determine how many recipes he learns:
- He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

Number of recipes = Total hours / Hours per recipe = 48 / 1.5 = 32

So, John learns 32 recipes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Kassidy has:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as much money as Aurelia.
   - Therefore, Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \) dollars.

2. **Determine how much money Rayna has:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - Therefore, Rayna has \( 90 + 60 = 150 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money they have together:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has $90.
   - Rayna has $150.
   - Total money = \( 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \) dollars.

4. **Determine how much each person would have if they shared the total amount equally:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Distribution of Days:**
   - Good days: 12
   - Bad days: 8
   - Neutral days: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

2. **Distribution Over the First 24 Days:**
   - First 8 days: Good
   - Second 8 days: Bad
   - Third 8 days: Neutral

3. **Next Three Days:**
   - Day 25: Good
   - Day 26: Neutral
   - Day 27: Good

4. **Counting Good Days:**
   - Initial good days: 12
   - Additional good days in the next three days: 2 (Day 25 and Day 27)

5. **Total Good Days:**
   - Total good days = 12 + 2 = 14

6. **Days Left in the Month:**
   - Total days in the month: 30
   - Days already accounted for: 27 (24 initial + 3 next days)
   - Days left: 30 - 27 = 3

7. **Good Days Left in the Month:**
   - Since the next three days are already accounted for, and we know the total good days, the number of good days left in the month is the total good days minus the good days already counted.
   - Good days left = 14 - 2 = 12

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 12.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2S + 3 \]

We are also told that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To solve for \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we will convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is:
600 inches (final height) - 240 inches (initial height) = 360 inches

Now, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find the number of days:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James then buys 12 more toys to have one for each of the 24 dogs, so he now has 12 (previous) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys, which is exactly the number of dogs.

James needs 21 toys in total.

"To determine how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps of the investments made by Dylan and Frances, and then calculate the remaining amount for Skyler.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   - Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   - Total amount = $1200.
   - Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \) dollars.

2. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment.
   - Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   - Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \) dollars.

4. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Remaining amount after Dylan's investment - Frances's investment.
   - Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

5. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after Dylan's and Frances's investments.
   - Skyler's investment = 240 dollars.

Thus, Skyler's investment is 240 dollars.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

First, we calculate the length of the dress after the 50% extension:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Next, we add the 20 cm of lace trim to this extended length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know that this total length equals 140 cm:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R \), we can find \( T \):

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Next, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This $1.20 is the total cost for four candies. To find the cost of one candy, divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:
$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. First, calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00

Then, calculate the cost of 10 candies:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong. Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which means:

Neil's monthly savings = Rong's monthly savings + (2/5 * Rong's monthly savings)
Neil's monthly savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's monthly savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's monthly savings = 20 + 8
Neil's monthly savings = 28 coins

Now, we calculate the total savings for both Rong and Neil over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are 120 months.

Rong's total savings = 20 coins/month * 120 months
Rong's total savings = 2400 coins

Neil's total savings = 28 coins/month * 120 months

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs required for the function and then compare it to the number of chairs currently available at the restaurant.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 \text{ (adults)} + 15 \text{ (babies)} = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs available:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so the number of regular chairs is:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}

"To find out how many great grand-babies will be at the family reunion, we need to follow the family tree down to the great grand-babies.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 children of their own, so the number of great grand-babies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies at the family reunion.

"Greta starts with a paycheck of $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account, which is:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she has $1200.00 left after funding her retirement account. Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment, which is:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Subtracting the car payment from the remaining amount after the retirement contribution:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

"To determine how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to calculate the number of fireworks set off by the city that she can see and add the number of fireworks she sets off herself.

First, calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks:
300 fireworks * 40% = 300 * 0.4 = 120 fireworks

Next, calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city to the fireworks she sets off herself:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, let's first determine the capacity of each truck:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds.

Now, let's add the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks and subtract that from the total combined capacity to find Gary's truck capacity:

4,000 (Gissela's truck) + 4,800 (Gordy's truck) = 8,800 pounds

11,600 (total combined capacity) - 8,800 (Gissela's and Gordy's combined) = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

Given that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
3 dumplings/female + 1 dumpling = 4 dumplings

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Let's denote the speed of the turtle as \( S \) (in feet per second). Since the cat is 5 times faster, we can write the relationship as:
\[ 15 \text{ feet/second} = 5 \times S \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} \]
\[ S = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money. We know that after 3 hours, they have raised $2100. 

1. Calculate the hourly rate of fundraising:
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. Determine the total amount of money still needed to reach the goal:
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Hourly rate}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours needed to find the total hours required:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the firefighters have to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for all purposes, which is given as 40%.
2. Calculate the percentage of the city's water use that is for industrial purposes, which is 80% of the 40%.
3. Subtract the industrial water use from the total city water use to find the non-industrial water use.

Let's calculate:

1. Total water use by the city: 40% of the river's water.
2. Industrial water use: 80% of 40% = 0.80 * 40% = 32% of the river's water.
3. Non-industrial water use: 40% (total city use) - 32% (industrial use) = 8% of the river's water.

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
     \[
     \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

3. **Total Production in 48 Hours:**
   - For chocolate ice cream:
     \[
     50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
     \]
   - For vanilla ice cream:
     \[
     12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
     \]

4. **Total Quarts of Ice Cream in 48 Hours:**
   - Adding the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:
     \[

"To find Marcus' total bill, we first calculate the cost of each type of item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to find the final total:

Final total = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:

$45.00"
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal:
- Erin has $6.00.
- Each scoop costs $1.50.
- Number of scoops she can buy = $6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops.

Now, let's apply the deal:
- For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free.
- With 4 scoops, she can get 2 sets of 2 scoops, which means she gets 2 free scoops.

So, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
- 4 scoops (bought) + 2 scoops (free) = 6 scoops.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each have after two weeks, and then find the difference between the amounts of candy they have.

First, let's determine how many pieces of candy each of them eats in two weeks.

- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), Ginger eats:
  \( 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \)

- Amy eats 3 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), Amy eats:
  \( 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \)

Next, we subtract the amount of candy each has eaten from their initial amount of 100 pieces to find out how much candy they have left.

- Ginger's remaining candy:
  \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \)

- Amy's remaining candy:
  \( 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \)

Finally, we find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:

- Difference in candy:
  \( 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \)

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

"To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries compared to buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and then compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Pounds bought
   Total cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost of buying = $75

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need.

Step 1: Total pieces of gum needed for 30 days
Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so for 30 days, he will need:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Step 2: Number of packs needed
Each pack contains 15 pieces, so the number of packs required is:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, and 8 packs will give him exactly 120 pieces, he will need 8 packs to last him 30 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's father's age:**
   - Dora's age is 15 years.
   - Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   - Twice Dora's age is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
   - Eight more than twice Dora's age is \(30 + 8 = 38\).
   - Therefore, Dora's father is 38 years old.

2. **Determine Dora's mother's age:**
   - Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   - Dora's father is 38 years old.
   - Four years younger than 38 is \(38 - 4 = 34\).
   - Therefore, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

3. **Calculate the total combined age:**
   - Dora's age is 15 years.
   - Dora's father's age is 38 years.
   - Dora's mother's age is 34 years.

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we first need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Calculate the water used for the giant cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes = 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces.

2. **Calculate the water used for the medium cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes = 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces.

3. **Calculate the water used for the small cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes = 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces.

4. **Calculate the total water used:**
   - Total water used = Water used for giant cubes + Water used for medium cubes + Water used for small cubes
   - Total water used = 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces = 30 ounces.

5. **Calculate the water left:**

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books each person has.

1. We know that Clara has 20 books.
2. Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so if we let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has, then \( 2S = 20 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 10 \). So, Steven has 10 books.
3. Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Since Steven has 10 books, Alice has \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books. The difference is \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:**
   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so in two months, there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weeks.
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - Therefore, in 8 weeks, there are \(8 \times 5 = 40\) weekdays and \(8 \times 2 = 16\) weekend days.

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays:**
   - Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
   - The total number of chairs rented on weekdays is \(60 \times 40 = 2400\) chairs.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekends:**

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 63 small buttons

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs double the first house, so the number of cases needed for the third house is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each:

20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We can find out how much more he needs to make by subtracting the amount he makes from the eggplants from his total goal:

$135 - $60 = $75

This is the amount he needs to make from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from the corn by the number of ears of corn:

$75 / 25 ears of corn = $3/ear of corn

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

1. **Calculate the number of movies in series:**
   - Mike has 600 movies in total.
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies.

2. **Calculate the cost of the movies in series:**
   - The cost of a normal movie is $10.
   - The cost of a movie in a series is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the cost of a normal movie.
   - Cost of a movie in a series = \( \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for movies in series = \( 200 \times 1.67 = 334 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the number of remaining movies:**
   - Total movies = 600
   - Movies in series = 200
   - Remaining movies = 600 - 200 = 400 movies.

4. **Calculate the number of older movies:**
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies = \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies.

5. **Calculate the cost of the older movies:**
   - The cost of an older movie is $5.
   - Total cost for older movies = \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

6. **Calculate the number of normal movies:**

"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit he picked and then add those costs together.

For the peaches, at $2.00 per pound, 6 pounds would cost:
6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00

For the plums, at $1.00 per pound, 8 pounds would cost:
8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00

For the apricots, at $3.00 per pound, 6 pounds would cost:
6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs of all the fruits together to find the total amount spent:
$12.00 (peaches) + $8.00 (plums) + $18.00 (apricots) = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent a total of $38.00 on fruit.

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking.

First, let's determine the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. The driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so half of that is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, the hiking speed is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance covered while hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long they drove. The total time for the trip was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is:

\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance covered while driving is:

\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points for each based on the given information and then find the difference.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Ava's points:
- Enemies: \( E + 8 \) (since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma)
- Berries: \( B + 3 \) (since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma)
- Timer: \( T - 4 \) (since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower)

Emma's points:
- Enemies: \( E \)
- Berries: \( B \)
- Timer: \( T \)

The scoring system is:
- 10 points for each enemy
- 5 points for each berry
- 30 points for each second left on the timer

Calculating Emma's total score:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T \]

Calculating Ava's total score:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

Now, we find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = -25 \]

The difference between their two scores is:

"To find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost, we can start by subtracting the total cost of the two pizzas that we know the price of from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. So, the cost of the remaining two pizzas is:

64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the remaining pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:

34 dollars / 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of rides on the 5 days when they ride thrice a day, and the number of rides on the 2 days when they ride twice as much as on the usual days.

1. For the 5 days when they ride thrice a day:
   \( 5 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 15 \text{ rides} \)

2. For the 2 days when they ride twice the usual amount (which is thrice a day, so twice that would be six times a day):
   \( 2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ rides/day} = 12 \text{ rides} \)

Now, we add the rides from both parts to get the total number of rides in a week:
\( 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we calculate 3/5 of 10:

(3/5) * 10 = 6 groups

Now, we know that 6 groups had members bring back seashells. Since each member of these groups brought back 2 seashells, and each group has 9 members, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by multiplying the number of groups by the number of members in each group and then by the number of seashells each member brought:

6 groups * 9 members/group * 2 seashells/member = 108 seashells

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly payroll.
3. Multiply the total monthly payroll by the number of months to get the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of new employees hired is:
20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:

"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we first need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it.

Half of Pierson's score is \( \frac{278}{2} = 139 \).

Nikita scored 11 more than this, so Nikita's score is \( 139 + 11 = 150 \).

To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add Pierson's score to Nikita's score:

\( 278 + 150 = 428 \).

"To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students each.
- So, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers each.
- So, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of this total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we first calculate the total hours she has already played.

1. Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks:
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - Half an hour is 0.5 hours.
   - Total hours for 2 weeks: \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

2. Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for a week:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total hours for 1 week: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

3. Adding the hours from both periods:
   - Total hours played: \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

4. Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the remaining hours she needs to play are:
   - Remaining hours: \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and then add the 30% premium.

1. First, we add the cost of the diamond and the gold:
   - Diamond: $600
   - Gold: $300
   - Total cost of materials: $600 + $300 = $900

2. Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:
   - 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

3. Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:
   - Total cost of materials: $900
   - Premium: $270
   - Final amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

The final amount James paid is $1170.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate is 40%. Therefore, the fifth-graders' pass rate is 80%, which means 80 out of 100 fifth-graders passed. For 400 fifth-graders, the number who passed is \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)
- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.70 \times 100 = 70\% \]

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area that can be covered.

First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag holds 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
- Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Now, we know the mosaic is 3 inches tall, so we need to find out how long it can be:
- Area of the mosaic = height * length.
- 12 square inches = 3 inches * length.
- Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by all the students together:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

We then add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea that was at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

Therefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150, which means he sold all 100 he originally had and needed 50 more to fulfill the orders. He then ordered 100 more candies, bringing his total to 100 (the new order) - 50 (the additional candies needed to fulfill the previous order) = 50 candies left to sell. 

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of May and then subtract the initial number of students (10) to find out how many additional students have joined.

The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Starting with 10 students:

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

By the end of May, there are 320 students on campus. To find the number of additional students who have joined, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the total number of students at the end of May (320):

\(320 - 10 = 310\)

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower Rose picked, subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. For the first set of flowers: 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.

2. For the second set of flowers: 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.

3. For the third set of flowers: 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.

4. For the fourth set of flowers: 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Now, we add up all the petals:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals in total before any flowers were dropped.

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one flower from each type:
- 5 petals from the first type,
- 6 petals from the second type,
- 4 petals from the third type,
- 7 petals from the fourth type.

Total petals dropped:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

Subtract the dropped petals from the total:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals.

The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"John and DeSean together made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores, which means they used 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows, so in total, 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows were used or lost. The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows. Since there are two of them, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \)

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \)

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has initially:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Calculate the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he has \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars left.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days to get the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards each person has in terms of PJ's cards. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards. According to the problem:

- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. To find out how many cards Becca has, we use the expression for Becca's cards:

\[ 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the standard installation fee and the cost for the additional items:
$129.00 (standard installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the information step by step.

1. First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings: 40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.
4. Therefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given as 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Finally, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
\[
480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours, so the distance covered in the first part is:

8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

After taking some rest, he continues his journey for another 6 hours. The distance covered in the second part is:

8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both parts of the journey:

32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance \(D\) is the same for all animals. The speed of one kangaroo \(S_k\) can be calculated as:
   \[
   S_k = \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}}
   \]

2. Since the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle \(S_t\) is:
   \[
   S_t = \frac{1}{2} S_k = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). The combined speed of 4 turtles is:
   \[
   4 \times S_t = 4 \times \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{4D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}
   \]

4. The time \(T\) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \(D\) is:
   \[
   T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, to find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

\[ 20 \text{ (Kora)} + 40 \text{ (Rory)} + 80 \text{ (Jada)} = 140 \]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after the trade-in, her part-time job pay, and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

The original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gives her $80. If she now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up the following equation to find out how much she has in her purse:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 150 + 80 + 50 = 400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 280 = 400 \]

Subtract 280 from both sides to solve for the money in her purse:

\[ \text{Money in purse} = 400 - 280 \]
\[ \text{Money in purse} = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he gets from slicing 3 large and 5 small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples will yield:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will yield:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices left

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk currently produced by the 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
3 cows * 5 liters/cow/day = 15 liters/day

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The current production is 15 liters, so the additional amount needed is:
25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:
10 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow/day = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[ 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters} \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. The remaining length is:
   \[ 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters} \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. The remaining length is:
   \[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters} \]

Now, we add the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[ 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters} \]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Total socks: 30 (Jack) + 60 (Peter) = 90 socks
- Total dishes: 60 (Jack) + 30 (Peter) = 90 dishes

Adding these together gives the total number of items:

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total, and 5 + 8 = 13 students are good at only one of the subjects, the number of students good at both is:

20 - 13 = 7 students

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

The intermission takes 10 minutes, so the time available for performances and transitions is:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires:
2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = 10 minutes per group

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal.
- Time (T) = 3 years

First, convert the rate to a decimal:
\[ \text{Rate} = 0.75 \]

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]

Next, add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - There are 40 white shirts in total.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - There are 50 floral shirts in total.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the total number of pairs of shoes bought in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs bought:
$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

So, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( A \)
- My brother's age: \( B \)

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( A = B - 3 \)
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( A = S + 2 \)
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \)

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A - 2 \]

Next, we substitute \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum of ages equation:
\[ A = B - 3 \]
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]
\[ M = 3B - 1 \]

Now, substitute these into the sum of ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:

"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The bag of potatoes weighed 5 pounds.
2. The bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, so:
   \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \)
3. The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so:
   \( 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \)

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make the total number of jello cups.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
- There will be 30 kids, and each kid will have 4 jello cups.
- Total jello cups needed = 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups

Step 2: Determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required.
- Each three-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups.
- Number of boxes needed = Total jello cups needed / Jello cups per box = 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
- Each box costs $1.25.
- Total cost = Number of boxes * Cost per box = 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.00

Therefore, Greg will spend $15.00 on jello.

"To find out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost, we first need to determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of one bottle of soda is:
$21.00 / 7 bottles = $3.00 per bottle

The cost of one bottle of water is:
$8.00 / 4 bottles = $2.00 per bottle

Now, we can calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
(3 bottles * $3.00 per bottle) + (2 bottles * $2.00 per bottle) = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to determine her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Ella's hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours
Ella's hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Ella's hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know Ella earns $11 per hour, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours.

Earnings for 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours
Earnings for 12 hours = $11 * 12
Earnings for 12 hours = $132

"To determine how much money Isaias spent on the chickens he took to the market, we first need to calculate how many chickens he plans to sell and then use the information about the profit to find the cost.

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
   \[
   \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
   \]

2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
   \]

3. Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the cost of the chickens can be found by subtracting the profit from the total revenue:
   \[
   \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
   \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we know that Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation to find her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Total cost for 6 packets of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first subtract the time of the encore from the total runtime of the final concert. The final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes long. The encore itself is 15 minutes long.

So, the length of the final concert without the encore is:
65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert (excluding the encore) is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the length of the final concert (excluding the encore) by 2.

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
3. The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's.

First, we need to determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid $6, and we don't have the rate per mow, we can assume that $6 is the total amount for the month. This means Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, as the problem does not specify multiple payments from Joe.

Now, let's calculate the earnings from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 1 time, $6
- Kamala's lawn: 3 times (3 * 1 = 3 times)
- Alba's lawn: 5 times (5 * 1 = 5 times)

Assuming the rate for mowing each lawn is the same, and since Joe's lawn was mowed once for $6, each mow costs $6.

Now, calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 1 * $6 = $6
- Kamala's lawn: 3 * $6 = $18
- Alba's lawn: 5 * $6 = $30

Total earnings from mowing lawns = $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Since Tasha made a total of $80 last month, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
$80 - $54 = $26

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, and each person will have one bowl at dinner, we need to calculate how much soup will be left after dinner.

First, let's determine how much of the pot is used for dinner:
- Calvin (1 adult bowl)
- His wife (1 adult bowl)
- Their two children (2 child bowls)

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total amount of soup used for dinner is:
- 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife) = 4 child bowls
- 2 child bowls (for the children)

So, the total amount of soup used for dinner is 4 (adult equivalent) + 2 (children) = 6 child bowls.

The pot originally holds 8 child bowls, so the amount of soup left after dinner is:
8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls

Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total Material Needed:**
   - The total material required is the sum of the material for small masks and large masks.
   - Total material = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she bought and then divide the total amount of money she spent by this number.

First, we determine the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 movies.
- She saw each movie 3 times.

Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 times per movie = 27 tickets

Next, we know she spent a total of $216 on these tickets.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 tickets

Now, we perform the division:
Average price per ticket = $8

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many blue and red shoe boxes Tim uses and then subtract these from the original amounts to find out how many are left.

Tim starts with:
- 7 blue shoe boxes
- 9 red shoe boxes

He uses:
- 3 blue shoe boxes
- 1/3 of his red shoe boxes

First, calculate how many red shoe boxes 1/3 of 9 is:
1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3 red shoe boxes

Now, subtract the used shoe boxes from the original amounts:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

So, the total number of shoe boxes left is:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie, which is 1/5 of his total marbles.
2. Subtract the number of marbles given to Jamie from the total.
3. Subtract the 10 marbles given to Donald from the remaining total.

First, we calculate 1/5 of Dean's 30 marbles:
1/5 * 30 = 6 marbles

Next, we subtract the 6 marbles given to Jamie from the total:
30 - 6 = 24 marbles

Then, we subtract the 10 marbles given to Donald from the remaining 24 marbles:
24 - 10 = 14 marbles

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
3. We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
5. Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( A - 4 \):
   \[
   26 = A - 4
   \]
6. Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30
   \]
7. Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   \[
   A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find the total number of acres that Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms have together, we first need to determine the size of each farm and then add them together.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 acres:
Twice Farmer Brown's farm: 2 * 200 = 400 acres
Adding 100 acres: 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together:
Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Farmer Smith's farm: 500 acres
Total: 200 + 500 = 700 acres

The two farms together have 700 acres.

"To determine how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we first need to calculate the number of packages he completes per hour and then find out his total earnings for the day.

1. Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour:
   - He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
   - 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

2. Calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday:
   - 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

3. Calculate his total earnings for the day:
   - He earns $0.20 for each package.
   - 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.00.

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which means he drinks 1 bottle every 30 minutes.
2. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes to complete.
3. An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal Sudoku puzzle, so it takes 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes.
4. To find out how many bottles of water he drinks during the 180 minutes, we divide the total time by the time it takes to drink one bottle: 180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water during the time it takes to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Next, subtract the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces of bologna to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Now, determine the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces thrown per yellow balloon:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is:

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first calculate the total miles driven in that month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven in a month is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals fit into 3000 miles, as the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, at $7 each, is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14
- Total cost = $28

Since this total amount was the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, we divide it by 2 to find out how much each received:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2
- Allowance per person = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the total profit the class was able to raise from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

The profit is:

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we first need to calculate how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

Given that one trip takes 4 hours, the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he must pick up per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20

   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total hay needed:
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week. John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, we'll subtract the amount he spends on gas and the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:

300 dollars - 50 dollars (gas) - 100 dollars (bank) = 150 dollars remaining

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 5 pencils:

5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

150 dollars - 50 dollars (pencils) = 100 dollars remaining

Finally, we'll determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:

100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4 pens

So, John can buy 4 pens.

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of letters in the words Craig has spelled. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig and his brother have spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has:**
   - Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.
   - The teacher has 9 coupons.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles is \( 9 \times 100 = 900 \) bottles.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students:**
   - There are 29 pupils in the class.
   - Each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is \( 29 \times 2 = 58 \) bottles.

3. **Calculate the number of bottles of apple juice left for the teacher:**
   - Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles.
   - The number of bottles left for the teacher is \( 900 - 58 = 842 \) bottles.

Thus, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each segment of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - The time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - The rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).
   - The time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, and the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had, we can express this as:

Bakery's loaves = 7 * Sam's loaves - 40

Substituting Sam's loaves with 70:

Bakery's loaves = 7 * 70 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 490 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 450

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum them up.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - For 6 copies, the total commission = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - For 10 copies, the total commission = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission from both newspapers = $3.00 (New York Times) + $12.00 (Wall Street Journal) = $15.00.

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15.00.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two more equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier than usual.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up earlier:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks (14 days).
   - Total patients admitted in 14 days = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

4. **Total Occupied Beds After 14 Days**: 
   - Initial occupied beds + Total patients admitted = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

5. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 14 Days**:
   - Total capacity - Total occupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So, we have:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day.

The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10.

The number of holes dug by the end of the second day is 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) = 23.

The number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 23 (end of second day) + 8 (third day) - 2 (filled in) = 29.

The number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day, which is 4 * 10 = 40.

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:

40 (end of fourth day) - 29 (end of third day) = 11.

The pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( W \).

First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[
A + S + W = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is:
\[
147

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can set up the following relationship:

Number of episodes = 20 / 2 = 10 episodes

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = Number of episodes * Length of each episode
Total time = 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode
Total time = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and then use that information to find the number of states in India as described.

The United States has 50 states.

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we calculate half of 50 and then add 4:

Half of 50 is 25, and 25 + 4 = 29.

So, India has 29 states.

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India:

50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If Robert has 30 and Richard has 20, together they have \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means Jerry has \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Jerry has 10 cherries.
- The difference is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the price per box.

First, let's find out how many boxes of each item Sunny sold on Saturday and Sunday.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes (4 fewer than gingerbread)

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes (5 more than Saturday)
- Apple pie: 15 boxes (as given)

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:

**Total gingerbread:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the total earnings from each item:

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- Total gingerbread boxes: 25
- Price per box: $6
- Total earnings: 25 * 6 = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- Total apple pie boxes: 21
- Price per box: $15
- Total earnings: 21 * 15 = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both items to find the total earnings over the two days:

Total earnings = Earnings from gingerbread + Earnings from apple pie
Total earnings = $150 + $315 = $465

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over the 8 days of her vacation.

Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour. If she is outside for 4 hours a day, she will use:
1 ounce/hour * 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day

Over 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen used will be:
4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces

Since each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces, the number of bottles she will need is:
32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Emil's Current Age**: Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. **Emil's Age When He Turns 24**: In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.
3. **Dad's Age When Emil Turns 24**: At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad. Therefore, Emil's dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. **Dad's Current Age**: Since this will be in 5 years, Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
5. **Brother's Age When Emil Turns 24**: At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother. Therefore, Emil's brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.
6. **Brother's Current Age**: Since this will be in 5 years, Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
- Dad's current age: 43 years
- Brother's current age: 7 years

Sum of their ages: 43 + 7 = 50

"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days and then divide that by the amount that constitutes one serving.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is:
4 * 3 pounds = 12 pounds

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is:
12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days is:
3 pounds (Thursday) + 12 pounds (Friday) + 6 pounds (Saturday) = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is:
21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings

"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players are accounted for:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we can add the number of football players to the number of cheerleaders and band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet**: Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower**: Each flower requires 1 foot of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each flower. Therefore, the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (flower)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many flowers can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/flower}} = 44.4 \text{ flowers}
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   44 \text{ flowers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy**: Pat already owns 17 flowers. Therefore, the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:
   \[
   44 \text{ flowers} - 17 \text{ flowers} = 27 \text{ flowers}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional flowers**: Each flowering plant costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for 27 flowers is:
   \[
   27 \text{ flowers} \times 6 \text{ dollars/flower} = 162 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (for sunflowers) + 15 pounds (for carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. After planting the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, with the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly savings for shoes.
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Step 2: Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
Jessica saves $500.00 each month, so in a year (12 months), she will save:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to saute, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on Low for 3 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on High for 4 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Total Cooling:**
   - The total cooling effect is \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.

4. **Warming Up for 2 Hours:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

5. **Final Temperature Change:**
   - The net change in temperature is the total cooling minus the warming.
   - Net change = \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the checks for each category and then sum them up.

1. **Electric Bill**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

2. **Gas Bill**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

3. **Church**: 2 checks per month
   - 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: 1 check per quarter
   - 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Now, we add up all the checks:
- Electric Bill: 12 checks/year
- Gas Bill: 12 checks/year
- Church: 24 checks/year
- Pest and Lawn Service: 4 checks/year

Total checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Determine the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Determine the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11.

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of all three howls:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
\[ 120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is the sum of their ages:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice this average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the size of the slices for the adults and the kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices. There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total watermelon is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), and since the total watermelon is \( 8x \), the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the number of sessions per month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented 3 days a week, which means it is rented 12 times a month (3 days/week * 4 weeks/month).

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the cost per session for the students is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The total cost per session is the sum of the rental cost and the student cost:
$25 (rental) + $15 (students) = $40 per session.

Since the studio is rented 12 times a month, the total monthly cost is:
$40 * 12 = $480.

However, the question asks for the expected earnings, which typically refers to income, not costs. If the question is asking for the total amount of money the studio collects (which would be considered revenue, not earnings, as earnings usually refer to profit after expenses), we need to calculate the total revenue from the students.

Each student pays $1.50 per session, and with 10 students, the revenue per session is:
$1.50 * 10 = $15.

The total revenue for 12 sessions in a month is:
$15 * 12 = $180.

If the question is indeed asking for the earnings (profit), we would subtract the total costs from the total revenue:
$180 (revenue) - $480 (costs) = -$300 (a loss).

However, since the question asks for the expected earnings, and typically this would mean the total amount collected, the answer is the total revenue, which is $180.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   - Number of female porcupines = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \).

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Total number of babies born each month = 30 (female porcupines) \(\times\) 4 (babies per female) = 120 babies.

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total number of babies born in a year = 120 (babies per month) \(\times\) 12 (months) = 1440 babies.

4. **Calculate the total population after a year:**
   - Initial population = 50 porcupines.
   - Total population after a year = Initial population + Total number of babies born in a year.
   - Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final numerical answer is:
1490"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the volume in gallons.
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{USD/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{USD} \]

The cost to fill the pool is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 3 \times 0.07x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28\% \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28\%}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 5 \times 0.09y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44\% \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44\%}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

Next, we calculate Janet's total earnings per hour, which include both her wages and tips.

\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

Now, we calculate her total earnings per week, given that she works 40 hours a week.

\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up these amounts to find the total spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has to spend on plums is:

Remaining money = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to first determine how many pictures were in each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 of the albums were selfies and 2 of the albums were portraits. To find out the total number of selfies and portraits, we multiply the number of pictures per album by the number of albums for each category:

Selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures
Portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures

Adding the selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

So, Olivia had 45 pictures that were either selfies or portraits.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 120 = 12x + 4(2x) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solve for \( x \):

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. This is a 50% chance.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher is present, there is a 40% chance she will give an extension to the whole class.
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension to the whole class (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension.

Let's calculate the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework in the normal teacher scenario:

- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension to the whole class: 40% or 0.40
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension to the whole class but Marcus getting a personal extension: 60% * 20% = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12 or 12%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework in the normal teacher scenario:
0.40 + 0.12 = 0.52 or 52%

Now, we combine the probabilities of both scenarios (substitute teacher and normal teacher):

- Probability of not having to turn in homework with a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of not having to turn in homework with the normal teacher: 52% or 0.52

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
0.50 + (0.50 * 0.52) = 0.50 + 0.26 = 0.76 or 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we first need to calculate the total number of seats available for guests. We start by subtracting the seats reserved for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000 seats
Seats for graduates: 950 seats
Seats for faculty: 300 seats

Seats available for guests = Total capacity - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Seats available for guests = 6000 - 950 - 300
Seats available for guests = 4750

Next, we divide the number of guest seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of tickets per graduate = Seats available for guests / Number of graduates
Number of tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Number of tickets per graduate = 5

   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to move to 7 more bottles (since he doesn't need to move after the last bottle).
   - Time to move from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds.
   - Total time to move between bottles = 7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds.

3. **Total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - Richard will drop the candy into the first bottle immediately, so we only count the time to move between the bottles.
   - Total time = 35 seconds.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she buys and then subtract that from the $50 she starts with.

First, calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
2 pounds of Parmesan at $11 per pound = 2 * $11 = $22

Next, calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
3 pounds of mozzarella at $6 per pound = 3 * $6 = $18

Now, add the costs of both types of cheese to find the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of mozzarella = $22 + $18 = $40

Finally, subtract the total cost of the cheese from the $50 Amor starts with:
Money left = $50 - $40 = $10

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in college, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost while in college:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's deliveries: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's deliveries: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209
   - Total: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, he won $11 on the second race.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 on the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 on the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race loss: $5
- Second race win: -$11 (this is a win, so it reduces the total loss)
- Third race loss: $16.50

Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $11.50

Since there were 3 races, we divide the total loss by 3 to find the average loss per race:
Average loss = $11.50 / 3

Now, let's calculate the average:
Average loss = $3.83 (rounded to two decimal places)

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since heights are given in both feet and inches, we will convert everything to inches for simplicity.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Multiply the total number of days by the number of hours worked each day to get the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Total number of days worked: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.
2. Fraction of a day worked each day: 3/8.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours: 3/8 * 24 hours/day = 9 hours/day.
4. Total hours worked by the team: 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours.
5. Hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3.

\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.78.

"To find out how many Spanish books are in the library, we first need to determine the number of books in English and German.

- The total number of books is 50.
- Half of them are in English, so there are 50 * 0.5 = 25 English books.
- 10% of the books are in German, so there are 50 * 0.1 = 5 German books.

The rest of the books are in Spanish. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

50 - 25 (English) - 5 (German) = 20 Spanish books.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food available by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Therefore, the total amount of food consumed per feeding is \( 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams} \).

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:
   - Total food per day = \( 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \).

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of big coupons:
- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons will be \(700 \times 2 = 1400\).

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is \(700 \times 5 = 3500\) cents.

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is \(1400 \times 15 = 21000\) cents.

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total amount spent on postage:
- Total cost = cost of small coupons + cost of big coupons = \(3500 + 21000 = 24500\) cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = \(24500 \div 100 = 245\) dollars.

For every 2 pounds of butter, the total cost is:
- $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (half price) = $6.00

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will buy 3 sets of 2 pounds each:
- 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break down the information given:

1. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days).
2. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
3. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.
4. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.
5. Since the total number of bananas is enough for a week, the total daily consumption for all three monkeys is 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.
6. The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is the total daily consumption minus the amount eaten by the first and second monkeys: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 15 roses:**
   - The cost of a dozen (12) roses is $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 + 3 roses.
   - The cost of 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost of 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for 15 roses = $15 + $6 = $21.

2. **Determine the amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five $5 bills.
   - Total amount of money = 5 * $5 = $25.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny should receive:**
   - Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses
   - Change = $25 - $21 = $4.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Number of quarters = $4 / $0.25 = 16.

So, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

The total number of toothpicks required for the sculpture is 200. Therefore, the number of toothpicks Melanie still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks she needs to save to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The watch was sold at 75% of its original price. The original price of the watch is $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid for it.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold to his friend} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

**Step 4: Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.**

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week and then add the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total minutes John spends in class during a normal school day:
- A normal student has 6 periods, and John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods a day.
- Each class is 40 minutes long, so in one day, he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class.

Next, we calculate the total minutes he spends in class over the 5 school days:
- 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week.

Now, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on each of these days:
- 1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes/day on Saturday and Sunday.

So, the total extra learning time over the weekend is:
- 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes.

Adding the extra learning time to the weekly class time gives us the total time spent learning in a week:
- 1600 minutes (weekdays) + 200 minutes (weekend) = 1800 minutes.

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours:
- 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours.

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then apply the same ratio to find the height of the second bounce.

First, we determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since each story is 24 feet high and Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, after the first bounce, the height the ball reaches is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball will again reach \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors had scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:

2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps based on the number of days he works.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of days worked * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance that Amber ran, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means:

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement period, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and how much she can save each year.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement income needed:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Current annual salary: $100,000
   - Annual retirement income needed: \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement savings needed: \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars

3. **Calculate the annual savings:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Annual savings: \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars

4. **Determine the number of years needed to save the total amount:**
   - Total savings needed: $800,000
   - Annual savings: $20,000
   - Number of years needed: \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her 20-year retirement.

"To find the length of each final cut, we first need to determine the length of the 4 equal parts Marty cuts the ribbon into. We do this by dividing the total length of the ribbon by 4:

100 centimeters / 4 = 25 centimeters

Each of these 25-centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 centimeters by 5:

25 centimeters / 5 = 5 centimeters

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and then figure out how many miles she plans to hike each day.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will hike:

\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:

\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and the distance she will cover at her current plan is:

\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:

\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse blinks. We know that the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can find the rate of blinking per minute by dividing the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes:

\[ \text{Rate of blinking} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks we want (459) by the rate of blinking (51 blinks per minute):

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house.
2. Double that distance to account for the round trip.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month.

Step 1: One-way distance
Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the one-way distance using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 2: Round trip distance
The round trip distance is twice the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 3: Monthly distance
John visits his parents twice a month, so the total monthly distance is:
\[ \text{Monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:
560"

"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Total toys needed**: 400 toys.
2. **Toys still needed after the shift**: 20 toys.
3. **Toys produced during the shift**: 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- **Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each**:
  - Total production per hour for these two workers: 2 * 6 = 12 toys.
  - Total production for their 10-hour shift: 12 * 10 = 120 toys.

- **Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each**:
  - Total production per hour for these two workers: 2 * 4 = 8 toys.
  - Total production for their 10-hour shift: 8 * 10 = 80 toys.

Adding the production of the first four workers:
- Total production by the first four workers: 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the total production during the shift was 380 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
- Total production by the fifth worker: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the production rate of the fifth worker is:
- Toys per hour for the fifth worker: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, he was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Now, solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} \]
\[ V = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs each of them painted as \( A \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Camden painted as \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \).

From the information given:
- \( C + S = 30 \)
- \( C = S + 12 \)

We can substitute \( C \) in the first equation with \( S + 12 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

4. **Total Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline**: Since the total number of eggs painted is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, the remaining eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline are:
\[ 56 - 30 = 26 \]

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:
\[ A + A = 26 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

5. **Difference in Eggs Painted by Camden and Arnold**:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds.

First, let's determine how many boxes Nik will need. Since he has 200 crayons and each box holds 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight in ounces:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, which includes the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's walking speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

So, Grandma walks at a speed of 1 mile per 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

   - She has been saving for 8 weeks.
   - Total saved so far = $4 * 8 = $32.

2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
   - Total goal = $60.
   - Amount already saved = $32.
   - Amount needed = $60 - $32 = $28.

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining amount:
   - She saves $4 each week.
   - Amount needed = $28.
   - Number of weeks required = $28 / $4 = 7 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has. The equation based on the information given is:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

- Increase in cows: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day for three weeks (21 days):
- Increase in chickens: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add the increases to the initial numbers:
- Total cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
- Total chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:
- Total animals: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find out how much each single bagel costs after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

- Each pack costs $10.00.
- Russell orders 4 packs.
- Total cost without discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

Next, step 2:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.
- Total cost after discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, step 3:

- Each pack contains 9 bagels.
- Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

Finally, step 4:

- Cost per bagel = Total cost after discount / Total number of bagels = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.

So, the cost per bagel after the discount is $1.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are used to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem:
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
3 less than 6 potatoes is:
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
1 less than 3 scoops is:
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Cross-multiplying gives:
3 * 18 = 2 * x
54 = 2x
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he will consume.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To find out how many blue jellybeans there are, we can start by calculating the number of red jellybeans, which is twice the number of green jellybeans. There are 17 green jellybeans, so:

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 passengers (5 men + 9 women), 5 are men and 9 are women. The total number of passengers is 84, so we can find out how many groups of 14 are in 84:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Since there are 6 groups of 14 passengers, the number of men and women can be calculated as follows:

- Number of men: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women: \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold over this period.

First, let's find out how many individual sunflowers Faraday sells per day:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sells per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
- \( 7 \text{ bouquets/day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers/bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day} \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = individual sunflowers + sunflowers in bouquets
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84 = 97.

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
- Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day \(\times\) 3 days = 291.

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with $100.
2. Determine how many rocks he sells, given that he sells 60% of his inventory.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
4. Calculate the total cost of the rocks he bought.
5. Determine the loss by subtracting the revenue from the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy.
Adam has $100 and each rock costs $5.
\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Step 2: Determine how many rocks he sells.
He sells 60% of his inventory.
\[ \text{Rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
Each rock is sold for $7.
\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the rocks he bought.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times \$5 = \$100 \]

Step 5: Determine the loss.
\[ \text{Loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Revenue} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

0.20 (probability of the first ticket winning) * 0.60 (probability of the second ticket winning) = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**

   Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand (100% / 20% = 5 bottles).

   Therefore, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
   \[
   2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine the current production capacity:**

   Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**

   The additional number of bottles required is the difference between the total number of bottles needed and the current production:
   \[
   11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

"To find out how many clouds Alice counted in total from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then sum them up.

- On Monday, she counts 3 clouds.
- On Tuesday, she counts double the number from Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) clouds.
- On Wednesday, she counts double the number from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) clouds.
- On Thursday, she counts double the number from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) clouds.
- On Friday, she counts double the number from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) clouds.

Now, we add up all the clouds she counted from Monday to Friday:

\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the special size box and then find out the cost per pod.

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. Calculate how many pods you can get for $1:
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, for $1 you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. The number of $20 bills he withdraws is:
   \[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

2. He loses 10 of these $20 bills, so the number of $20 bills he has left is:
   \[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

3. He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill. The number of $20 bills he uses is:
   \[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]
   So, the number of $20 bills he has left is:
   \[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

4. The value of the remaining $20 bills is:
   \[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

5. Thomas then triples his money. The new total amount of money he has is:
   \[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

6. He converts all his money into $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he gets is:
   \[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills} \]

Therefore, the number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

3. Total goals scored by each team:
   - Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
   - Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

4. Total number of goals scored in the match:
   - Total goals = Team A's goals + Team B's goals = 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches, using 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk each day:

- **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
  - Remaining chalk: \( 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.

- **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
  - Remaining chalk: \( 2.20 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

After Wednesday, the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after Wednesday.

The teacher has 2 more days (Tuesday and Wednesday) before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity and then subtract these numbers from the total number of boys and girls in the class.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
1/3 * 12 girls = 4 girls on varsity

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
1/4 * 12 boys = 3 boys on varsity

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity

The total number of students in the class is:
12 girls + 12 boys = 24 students

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. This means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

James has 30 teeth in total. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:
   - Cost per 100 books = $500
   - Total money = $27,000
   - Number of 100-book sets he can buy = $27,000 / $500 = 54 sets
   - Total number of books = 54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books

2. Since the books are to be distributed equally among 3 schools:
   - Books per school = Total number of books / 3 schools = 5400 books / 3 = 1800 books

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first throw) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (from the second throw) + 6 (newly fallen) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton has in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first pick-up.
- 5 apples from the second pick-up.
- 6 apples from the third pick-up.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices her friends will consume.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

Total slices of cheese pizza consumed by all friends:
6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices

Total slices of pepperoni pizza consumed by all friends:
6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices

Next, we calculate how many whole pizzas are needed for each type based on the number of slices per pizza:
- Cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.

Number of cheese pizzas needed:
36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

Number of pepperoni pizzas needed:
24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

Total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means he makes \( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \) of a snowball per minute.

Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. This means that the melting rate is \( \frac{2}{15} \) snowballs per minute.

The net rate of snowball accumulation is the difference between the making rate and the melting rate:
\[ \text{Net rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute} \]

To find out how long it will take to accumulate 60 snowballs at this net rate, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total snowballs needed}}{\text{Net rate}} = \frac{60}{\frac{1}{5}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \( x - 38 \) bandages left.
   - After ordering one bulk pack, they had \( x - 38 + 50 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - The number of bandages left after the second day is \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 = x - 38 + 50 - 28 = x - 16 \).

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - The number of bandages left after the third day is \( (x - 16 + 100) - 25 = x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 \).

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 59 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour = 67.5 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $101.25/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
$101.25/week * 4 weeks = $405

Next, let's add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
- Since she had no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 4 weeks.

So, her total attendance bonus for April is:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Now, we add her earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
$405 + $40 = $445

Therefore, Jen will receive $445 in April.

Next, we calculate the number of black pens:
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens.
- Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) packs of black pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of black pens is \(10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}\).

"First, let's calculate the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\$600}{10} = \$60 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \$60 + (0.5 \times \$60) = \$60 + \$30 = \$90 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times \$90 = \$1800 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each. This means she had:
   2 palettes * 4 colors/palette = 8 colors from the palettes.

2. She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, which means she had:
   3 sets * 6 colors/set = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors. Now she has:
   8 colors - 4 colors = 4 colors left from the palettes.

4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so she uses:
   6 colors / 2 = 3 colors.

5. After using up 3 colors from one makeup set, she has:
   6 colors - 3 colors = 3 colors left from that makeup set.

6. The other two makeup sets are untouched, so she still has:
   2 sets * 6 colors/set = 12 colors from the other makeup sets.

7. Adding up all the colors she has left, we get:
   4 colors (from the remaining palette) + 3 colors (from the used makeup set) + 12 colors (from the other makeup sets) = 19 colors.

"To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of the house.
2. Determine the height of the first floor.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof.

Step 1: Calculate the total height of the house.
The house is 7 times as high as Mattison, who is 60 inches tall.
\[ \text{Total height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Step 2: Determine the height of the first floor.
The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison.
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Step 3: Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.
\[ \text{Height from the second floor's floor to the roof} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance walked by the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. This means the total distance walked by all 4 dogs combined is 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

We know the distances for the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these distances together gives us 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance all four dogs need to walk:
12 miles (total) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"First, we need to calculate the amount of the loan John gets, which is 40% of the value of his home.

Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
Loan amount = 0.40 * $250,000
Loan amount = $100,000

Next, we calculate how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.

Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = 0.60 * $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = $60,000

Now, we can find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts.

Money leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
Money leftover = $100,000 - $60,000
Money leftover = $40,000

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. The selling price is 11/8 of the buying price.

The buying price of the magazines is $72. 

The selling price is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of the classes in each school.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes each have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

120 students / 8 = 15 students

John has two classes, so the total capacity for John's school is:

15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school to the capacity of John's school to get the combined capacity:

120 students (Ali's school) + 30 students (John's school) = 150 students

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - The new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is 4 times this length:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the number of pounds of ground beef.

Step 1: Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds needed for 80 meatballs by dividing 80 by 16.
\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 2: Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:
\[ \text{Tablespoons of seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of treats needed:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Total treats needed = 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - Therefore, the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as \( b = 3c - 2 \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.
   - Total treats = \( c + b \).
   - Substitute \( b \) with \( 3c - 2 \):
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10

"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a manicure and a pedicure with the 20% discount.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art.
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's find the combined cost of the manicure and pedicure before the discount:
- Manicure: $35
- Pedicure: $40
- Combined cost: $35 + $40 = $75

Next, apply the 20% discount to the combined cost:
- Discount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Discounted cost: $75 - $15 = $60

Now, calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails in total:
- Cost per nail: $3
- Total cost for nail art: 10 * $3 = $30

Finally, add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:
- Total cost: $60 + $30 = $90

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the price in December:**
   - The price in November was $40.
   - The price increased by 80% in December.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40: \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this is:
Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books each bookcase can hold.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books each, so together they can hold:
   \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) books.

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
   \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) books.

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
   \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) books.

4. Adding up the books that all the shelves can hold, we get the total capacity of one bookcase:
   \( 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \) books.

5. To find out how many bookcases Elly needs for her 110 books, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
   \( 110 \div 55 = 2 \).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To determine Rose's profit, we first need to calculate her total cost and her total revenue from selling the eggs.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the eggs:**
   - Rose bought five dozens of eggs.
   - The cost per dozen is $2.40.
   - Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40 per dozen = $12.00.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs:**
   - One dozen contains 12 eggs.
   - Five dozens contain 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:**
   - Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs.
   - Number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs = 60 / 3 = 20 sets.
   - Total revenue = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20.00.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

Therefore, Rose's profit is $8.00.

"To find out how much each stick of jerky costs in cents, we first need to calculate the cost per bag after the discount and then divide that by the number of sticks in the bag.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the discounted price is:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we have 30 sticks of jerky in a bag, so the cost per stick is:

$15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

Since we need the answer in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to pass = 77
- Questions already correct = 42
- Questions needed on the second test = 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To solve this, let's break down the information:

- There are 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights (1 for each person).
- There are 8 rooms, so there are 2 flashlights per room, which totals 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms.
- For the candles, half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's add up all the candles and flashlights:

- Total flashlights: 4 (personal) + 16 (rooms) = 20 flashlights
- Total candles: 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles

Adding the flashlights and candles together:

"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to travel both the land and water portions of his journey.

First, we need to find out how much distance he needs to cover on land and how much in water. Since the total distance is 200 yards and half of it is on land and the other half in water, we can divide the total distance by 2:

- Distance on land: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
- Distance in water: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes to travel each portion of the journey:

- Time on land: Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes
- Time in water: Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time for both portions to get the total time:

- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To find out how much Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stays and the cost of the bus rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of one night at the hotel is $80. Since Helen stayed for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel is:
3 nights * $80/night = $240

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is:
10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus rides is:
7 rides * $8/ride = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296

Therefore, Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels during that trip.

21 marbles (after dropping) + 4 marbles (dropped) = 25 marbles (original amount given by Mazie)

Now, we know that Mazie had 52 marbles in total and gave 25 to Dallas. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract the number of marbles given to Dallas from the total number of marbles:

52 marbles (total) - 25 marbles (given to Dallas) = 27 marbles (given to Darla)

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To calculate the force John needs to push the car, we first need to determine the total weight of the car including the luggage and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children together weigh 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.

The total weight is:
1200 (car) + 250 (luggage) + 150 (children) = 1600 pounds

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to apply 16 pounds of force to push the car.

"To determine how much crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length (long side) = 20 feet
- Width (short side) = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we know both of their ages, we can find the average:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in one day and then for a week.

1. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day, so each pig eats:
   4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day

2. Dexter has five pigs, so the total daily consumption for all pigs is:
   8 pounds/day/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day

3. To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 days:
   40 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week

4. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is:
   300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: The truck starts with 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. This means 5 more children join, making the total:
   \[
   5 + 5 = 10 \text{ children}
   \]
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. This means 20 more children join, making the total:
   \[
   10 + 20 = 30 \text{ children}
   \]
4. **After the Third Street**: The original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract the 5 original children from the total:

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she meditates for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- In one week, she practices yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she practices yoga for 300 minutes * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time spent = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 2040 minutes / 60 = 34 hours.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 34 hours on meditation and yoga practice.

"To find the total number of sunflower seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then the number of seeds in a large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, the small sunflower has:
3 dozen * 12 seeds/dozen = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of the small sunflower's seeds:
50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 seeds = 18 seeds

So, the large sunflower has:
36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

To find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds together:
36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds

"To find out how tall Jackie was before summer, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Albert's height is 36 inches.
2. Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is \( 36 \times 2 = 72 \) inches.
3. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is \( 72 - 2 = 70 \) inches.
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her height before the summer was \( 70 - 3 = 67 \) inches.

Therefore, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer.

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to consider the discounts on both the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price: $8.
- For the second T-shirt, Jake pays 50% of the original price: $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is:
$8 (first T-shirt) + $4 (second T-shirt) = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes with the 40% discount:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The discount is 40%, so Jake pays 60% of the original price: $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
$36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, we multiply $6 by 3:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes a day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes a day.

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. Total items Igor placed on the lab bench: 29

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract this from the total required:

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes a week from reservations, we need to calculate the total revenue from one night and then multiply it by the number of days the restaurant is open in a week.

First, let's calculate the revenue from one reservation:
- Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for meals is 2 * $5 = $10.
- Each reservation also orders a $5 bottle of wine.
- Therefore, the total cost per reservation is $10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from reservations for one night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, so the total revenue for one night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue from reservations is:
- $90 (one night) * 2 (days a week) = $180.

So, the restaurant makes $180 a week from reservations.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:
   Total cost = $80

2. Calculate the total profit:
   Profit percentage = 25%
   Total profit = Total cost * (Profit percentage / 100)
   Total profit = $80 * (25 / 100)
   Total profit = $80 * 0.25
   Total profit = $20

3. Calculate the total selling price:
   Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit
   Total selling price = $80 + $20
   Total selling price = $100

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   Number of watermelons = 50
   Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
   Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
   Selling price per watermelon = $2

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19 years old. Since James is 18 years old, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Difference = Number of oranges Ana peels - Number of oranges Jane peels
- Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.

The cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:
230"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is Henry and his 3 friends, making a total of 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
