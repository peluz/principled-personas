"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total costs from this value.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: $80,000
2. **Cost of Repairs**: $50,000
3. **Total Costs**: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house:

4. **Increase in Value**: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
5. **New Value of the House**: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, we calculate the profit:

6. **Profit**: New Value - Total Costs = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total feed needed is:
   \( 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \)

3. Calculate the total amount of feed already given to the chickens:
   In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
   In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
   Total feed given so far is:
   \( 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \)

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   The total feed needed for the day is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given. Therefore, the feed needed for the final meal is:
   \( 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \)

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After selling at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
6. After selling at the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which is given to be 5.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first calculate the total time she needs to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

1. First, determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels:
   \[
   \text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

2. Next, determine how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron:
   \[
   \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each segment of the game and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
- Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we add the points from both segments:
- Total points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes
- Total points = 4 + 5 = 9

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts consumed in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 60 yogurts
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25/yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distance she covers in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed \(\times\) time running = \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed \(\times\) time walking = \( 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \) miles.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had initially and after purchasing the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had remaining from the total number of Post-it notes she had to find out how many were in the package.

First, we know Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes.

Next, we know she had 23 Post-it notes remaining after placing the notes on the cups. This means the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she used and the Post-it notes she had left:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is the total number of Post-it notes she had minus the number she initially had:
\[ 243 - 80 = 163 \]

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of Cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for all the cell phones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months (3) to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
- Cost per cell phone: $150
- Number of cell phones: 5
- Total cost = $150 * 5 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the total interest for all the cell phones.
- Interest rate: 2%
- Total interest = $750 * 2% = $750 * 0.02 = $15

Step 3: Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
- Total amount to be paid = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 4: Divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months (3) to find the monthly payment.
- Monthly payment = $765 / 3 = $255

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To solve this problem, we first need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Next, we calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:

- Revenue from marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 per pot = $36.00
- Revenue from petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 per pot = $18.00
- Revenue from begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Finally, we add up the total revenue from all the flowers:

Total revenue = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) square feet
- Level 2: \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) square feet
- Level 1: \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is 60.

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food needed for 180 days: \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining days of the year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days: \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day for these remaining days.
   - Total dog food needed for 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days: 180 cups.
   - Total dog food for the remaining 185 days: 370 cups.
   - Total dog food for the year: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed: \( \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"First, let's determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate how much water the two girls got together. Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, for two girls:

\[ \text{Water each girl got} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls:

\[ \text{Total water for two girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

\[ \text{Total water taken} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water available was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

"Let's denote the number of games won as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the number of vacations he has been on and then multiply that by the number of shirts he gets per year.

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been going on vacations:
   - Gene is currently 34 years old and started going on vacations at 23 years old.
   - Number of years = 34 - 23 = 11 years

2. Calculate the total number of vacations:
   - Gene goes on 4 vacations a year.
   - Total number of vacations = 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations

3. Since each vacation results in one quilt block (one shirt), the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 44.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive over these years.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7200

Since Sylvie has just completed 5 years of service, she is eligible for a 10% increase in her initial salary.

3. **Salary Increase after 5 years**: 10% of $7200 = 0.10 * $7200 = $720
4. **New Annual Salary after 5 years**: $7200 + $720 = $7920

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next three years, with a 10% increase each year.

5. **Salary after 6 years**: $7920 + (10% of $7920) = $7920 + $792 = $8712
6. **Salary after 7 years**: $8712 + (10% of $8712) = $8712 + $871.20 = $9583.20
7. **Salary after 8 years**: $9583.20 + (10% of $9583.20) = $9583.20 + $958.32 = $10541.52

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, which can be represented as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that both the adult and child dinosaurs will consume.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.

\[ 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.

\[ 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad for the adults and children to find the total amount needed:

\[ 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

First, we find Corey's age:
- Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 11 years old.

Next, we find Amy's age:
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Now, we find Jackson's age:
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

Next, we find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, higher prices. Then, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the lumber:**
   - Total cost = $100 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180.

4. **Determine the new selling price for each type of board:**
   - The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
   - The price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Total revenue for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.

6. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Total revenue for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.

7. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:**
   - Total revenue = $150 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270.

8. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, Sasha's profit is $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of cups of water as \(13x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is given by:
\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 20:
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for the teaspoons of sugar:
\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. We can set up the equation:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.30L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% from his salary four years ago. Therefore:
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, her salary also increased by 40%. Therefore:
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ 99076.92 \]"

"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday. Therefore, she slept:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours each day}
   \]
   So, for Tuesday and Wednesday combined:
   \[
   6 + 6 = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. Therefore, she slept:
   \[
   6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours each day}
   \]
   So, for these four days combined:
   \[
   7 \times 4 = 28 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we add up the hours for all seven days:
\[
8 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 28 \text{ (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday)} = 48 \text{ hours}

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares.

First, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Next, each hectare produces 100 pineapples per harvest. Therefore, each hectare produces 100 pineapples * 4 harvests = 400 pineapples per year.

John has 10 hectares, so the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is 400 pineapples per hectare * 10 hectares = 4000 pineapples.

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which is \(\frac{500}{4} = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 blocks.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 that many bees return. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. 

To find out how many bees returned in the last 6 hours, we need to determine how many bees had left and not returned by that point:
- Initially, 30 bees left.
- 15 bees returned, so \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees were still out.
- Then, 60 more bees left, so the total number of bees that left and had not returned is \( 15 + 60 = 75 \).

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 75 bees returned to the hive.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home:
- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in their times is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Thus, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To determine how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating the tires of the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came by, each with a bicycle.
   - Total tires for bicycles: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
   - Cost for bicycles: \(10 \times 0.25 = 2.50\) dollars.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came by, each with a tricycle.
   - Total tires for tricycles: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
   - Cost for tricycles: \(9 \times 0.25 = 2.25\) dollars.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came by with a unicycle.
   - Total tires for the unicycle: \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.
   - Cost for the unicycle: \(1 \times 0.25 = 0.25\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs for all the tires:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. **Dave ate 14 fries.**
2. **The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:** \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:** \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. **Let \( x \) be the number of fries left after the pigeons ate.**
5. **The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:** \( \frac{2}{3}x \) fries.
6. **The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.**

We can set up the equation based on the remaining fries after the raccoon and ants:

\[ x - \frac{2}{3}x - 1 = 5 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, there were 18 fries left after the pigeons ate. Now, we need to find the total number of fries initially:

- Dave ate 14 fries.
- The seagull ate 7 fries.
- The pigeons ate 9 fries.
- The raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the 18 fries: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 18 = 12 \) fries.

Total fries eaten or taken:

\[ 14 + 7 + 9 + 12 + 1 = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it is:

\[ 43 + 5 = 48 \]

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each day:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
- He spends 3 hours on each of the 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- He spends 4 hours on each of the 2 days (Tuesday, Thursday), so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per week is \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, to find the total number of hours Kimo spends in class over the 16-week semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
\[ 17 \times 16 = 272 \]

Thus, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, in this case, feet. 

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Add the lengths together:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

The total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for all the apes combined:

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Adding these together gives the total monthly requirement:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there and 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
- Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase interval:**
   - Initial price: $20
   - Increase interval: every 2 months
   - Increase rate: 20% of the original price

2. **Calculate the number of increases over 36 months:**
   - 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

3. **Determine the price after each increase:**
   - Each increase adds 20% of the original price to the current price.
   - The original price is $20, so each increase adds $20 * 0.20 = $4.

4. **Calculate the total increase over 18 intervals:**
   - Total increase = 18 * $4 = $72

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost.
4. Calculate the cost of lemons based on the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. They made a profit of $25. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = 3 \text{ (lemons)} + 2 \text{ (sugar)} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made. The total cost is:
\[ C = 5G \]

The total revenue is the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total number of glasses sold is:
\[ \text{Total glasses} = 20G \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \]

Now we can set up the equation for profit:
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 5G \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes was 80, we calculate the winner's votes as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies (200) is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( C \).

\[ 200 = 5C \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses ordered is:

\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, determine Jan's age two years ago:
Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28

Next, use the information about Mark's age two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = 5 + (28 / 2) = 5 + 14 = 19

Now, determine Mark's current age:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21

Finally, determine Jean's current age:
Jean's current age = Mark's current age + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Team A (Well-Rounded Team):**
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for Team A = 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Team B (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
Difference = Total time for Team B - Total time for Team A = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities: \( \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \).

4. **Expressing the likelihood as a percentage:**
   - The event of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.
   - To express this as a percentage, we convert the ratio to a percentage: \( 2 \times 100\% = 200\% \).

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces (total) - 70 pieces (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 2\% = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees added each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

Step 1: Net number of trees added each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees added each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Number of trees left
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many pink and white plastic flamingos are in Sue's front yard by noon on Sunday.

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - 18 pink plastic flamingos are placed in Sue's front yard.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos are taken back and painted white.
   - These 6 white flamingos are then placed back in the yard.
   - Therefore, by the end of Saturday, there are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos in the yard.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers. 

First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives us Mark's total weekly earnings:

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the amount she needs by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white chickens than red chickens. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers + 50 more = 150 customers.
3. Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \).
4. The total number of customers over the three days is given as 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. According to the problem, the big pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, and the small pool is also leaking at the same rate.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons. We are given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

We are also given that now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's age.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
   \]
2. Adrian's age in three years:
   \[
   63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Zack's age in three years:
   \[
   42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the total time spent on each type of puzzle and then add those times together.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \( 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \( 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = Time spent on crossword puzzles + Time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

"First, we determine how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters.

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

This means 30 liters of water are left in the tank. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank.

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the total amount of water in the tank now is 90 liters.

"To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the cost for each of them separately and then add the two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- The total cost for Carlos is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- The total cost for Benji is \( 18 \times 5 = 90 \) dollars.

Now, we add the costs for Carlos and Benji to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = 90 + 90 = 180 dollars

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is 180 dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total new cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is 33%.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider how Ram can reuse the ink from the empty pens to make new full pens and continue this process until he can no longer make any new pens.

1. Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more full pen.
4. After using this 1 new pen, he will have 1 empty pen, which is not enough to make another full pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens + 5 new pens + 1 new pen = 31 pens.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information and setting up the equations.

1. The first aquarium has 4 snails.
2. The second aquarium has 32 snails.
3. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
4. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
5. Let \( f \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

2. Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works over the 5 weeks.
3. Calculate the total cost before the discount.
4. Apply the 10% discount to find the final amount Jean paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours per week.
- The makeup artist works 6 hours each day.
- She works 4 days a week.
- Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours over 5 weeks.
- Total hours over 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost before the discount.
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Step 4: Apply the 10% discount.
- Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.
- Final amount Jean paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cougars killed today:**
   - Last night, Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Today, he killed three fewer cougars than last night.
   - Therefore, the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

2. **Determine the number of wolves killed today:**
   - Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Since he killed 12 cougars today, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of animals killed today:**
   - Wolves killed today: 36
   - Cougars killed today: 12
   - Total animals killed today: \( 36 + 12 = 48 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of animals killed over both days:**
   - Wolves killed last night: 10
   - Cougars killed last night: 15
   - Total animals killed last night: \( 10 + 15 = 25 \)
   - Total animals killed over both days: \( 25 + 48 = 73 \)

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 73.

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. If Mitchel went down the slide 30 times and Anne went 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of 30:

30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:

30 - 9 = 21

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

21 * 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys more. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so initially, there are:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows per stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, each stall has the original 20 cows plus 2 new cows:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:
\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
- The total weight of the tree is \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate:
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- The weight of the wood eaten by the termites is \( 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \).

Finally, subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea's fruits: \(52\) apples + \(24\) bananas = \(76\) fruits.
- Jamal's fruits: \(44\) apples + \(48\) bananas = \(92\) fruits.

Total fruits = \(76 + 92 = 168\).

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies:**
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the amount needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:**
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Sum the amounts for both days:**
   - Total flour needed = 6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Selling Price of the House**: $400,000
2. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]
3. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]
4. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Next, we sum up all the expenses:
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{Transfer Fees} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount}

   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of sterling silver beads, we divide the total length for the beads by the length of one bead:
   \[
   \text{Number of sterling silver beads} = \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

Thus, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

So, in the second week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories written by all of them over the two weeks, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories

Adding these totals together:
\(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\)

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has before buying the can of pop. 

A quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
5 * 25 = 125 cents

A dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
2 * 10 = 20 cents

Adding these together, Kelly has:
125 + 20 = 145 cents

Now, subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents:
145 - 55 = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, we first calculate the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each 5-star row contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of 5-star rows is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, given its speed.

1. First, we find the speed of the car in the slow lane:
   - The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
   - The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed: \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles/hour.

2. Next, we use the formula for time, which is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

3. We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes are required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total amount by which the coffee is weakened.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:
     \[
     \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Determine the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is:
     \[
     5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Add the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   - The total weakening effect is:
     \[
     60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.
   - Salary of each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers \(\times\) Salary of each junior programmer.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers \(\times\) Salary of each senior programmer.
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = 60 \(\times\) $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers:**
   - Total payroll for all programmers = Total payroll for junior programmers + Total payroll for senior programmers.
   - Total payroll for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge required. 

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, it will take:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the customer had $4 in rewards to use on their current shopping trip. They also used a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon value} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the current shopping trip:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. After applying the total discount:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

This $2 is half of the change he received after buying the candy. Therefore, the total change he received is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Billy started with $10, the amount he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can write this relationship as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip and then determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   - The total distance for one trip is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   - The train makes 3 trips a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

4. Determine how many days the train can operate before reaching 18,000 miles:
   - The number of days before service is required is \( \frac{18,000}{900} = 20 \) days.

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The amount of stuffing for a collie bed is the average of these two amounts:
\[ \text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To determine how many days Mark needs to save to buy a bike that costs $300, we first need to calculate the total amount he needs to save. Since he already has $50 in his bank account, the additional amount he needs is:

$300 - $50 = $250

Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to save $250, we divide the total amount needed by his daily earnings:

$250 / $10 = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days.

"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. 
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we sum up all the bugs:
\[
\text{Total bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a year and then multiply that by his daily pay rate.

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works each month:
   - He works 4 weeks every month.
   - Each week, he works 6 days.
   - Therefore, the number of days he works each month is \(4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month}\).

2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year:
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of days he works in a year is \(24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year}\).

3. Calculate the builder's annual earnings:
   - He earns $50 per day.
   - Therefore, his annual earnings are \(288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year}\).

"To solve this, first, we need to determine how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs:
- 3 cups of flour × 4 = 12 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk × 4 = 4 cups of milk

Next, we need to figure out how many 2-cup bags of flour and 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

For flour:
- 12 cups of flour ÷ 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

For milk:
- 4 cups of milk ÷ 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

Now, we calculate how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:
- 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

2. Convert the daily energy usage to kilowatts:
   - 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy usage in kilowatts = 7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day.

3. Calculate the reduced daily energy usage:
   - If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for 3 hours a day.
   - Reduced daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - Reduced daily energy usage in kilowatts = 2700 watts/day / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, for 20 people:
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore:
\[ \text{Total cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars/pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars/pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, let's account for the additional items Allan bought:

3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he bought is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, let's find the new total number of corns:

5. The new total number of corns is \(80 + 60 = 140\).

Finally, let's find the combined total of corns and cannolis:

6. The combined total is \(140 + 100 = 240\).

"Elliott's total goal is 10,000 steps. He completed half of his steps to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can calculate the total steps he had taken before the jog and subtract this from the total steps he had left to reach his goal after the jog.

Steps taken before the jog: 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with friend) = 6,000 steps.
Steps left after the jog: 2,000 steps.

Total steps taken by the end of the day: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.
Steps taken during the jog: 8,000 (total by end of day) - 6,000 (before jog) = 2,000 steps.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments for both months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a standard month)

Total payment for May:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 40 \times 40 \times 4 \times 15 \]

\[ 40 \times 40 = 1600 \]
\[ 1600 \times 4 = 6400 \]
\[ 6400 \times 15 = 96000 \]

So, the total payment for May is $96,000.

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees working in June.**
- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees working in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hours per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in June: 4 (assuming a standard month)

Total payment for June:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 30 \times 40 \times 4 \times 15 \]

\[ 30 \times 40 = 1200 \]
\[ 1200 \times 4 = 4800 \]
\[ 4800 \times 15 = 72000 \]

So, the total payment for June is $72,000.

**Step 4: Sum the payments for both months.**
\[ 96000 + 72000 = 168000 \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $168,000.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $800. So, the total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the $1200. A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original price. So, the discounted price for the two packages is $1200 * 0.80 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the two packages. Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 cookies by 30 days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Next, we need to convert the total number of cookies into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is 30% of $20.
   - \( 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price per blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost is the discounted price per blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
   - \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) dollars.

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:
1. The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180.
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, dromedaries have 1 hump each) is 304.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the information given:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can solve the first equation for \( d \):
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c \), we can find \( d \) using the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Calculate the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

Kenny sold 100 cards, but he kept 1/3 of his original collection. This means the 100 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his original collection. Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with. Then:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially preparing for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means:
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - These 18 guests would each get 2 hotdogs, totaling 36 hotdogs.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, totaling 18 hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 (for the 18 guests with two hotdogs) + 18 (for the 18 guests with one hotdog) = 54 hotdogs.

3. However, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means:
   - Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

4. The caterer only had 54 hotdogs prepared, so the number of hotdogs short is:
   - 80 (needed) - 54 (prepared) = 26 hotdogs.

5. Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs to be satisfied, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
   - 26 hotdogs / 2 hotdogs/guest = 13 guests.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is $132.00.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

The total cost of the items is $19. Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Dora has $18 in total. To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length into feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 3 yards equals:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can use the area formula to find the width:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay. Each bail costs $3.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is:
- Movie super ticket: $20
- Popcorn and soda: $1 extra
- Total: $20 + $1 = $21

If you buy the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda at regular price, the total cost is:
- Movie ticket: $12
- Soda: $3
- Popcorn: Let's call this \( P \)
- Total: $12 + $3 + \( P \) = $15 + \( P \)

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda should be $2 less than the super ticket:
- $21 - $2 = $19

So, we set up the equation:
- $15 + \( P \) = $19

Solving for \( P \):
- \( P \) = $19 - $15

So, Toni has:

\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Therefore, we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of item for 80 rooms:

- **Total sheets**: 2 sheets/room * 80 rooms = 160 sheets
- **Total comforters**: 1 comforter/room * 80 rooms = 80 comforters
- **Total pillow cases**: 4 pillow cases/room * 80 rooms = 320 pillow cases
- **Total towels**: 8 towels/room * 80 rooms = 640 towels

Finally, we add up all the pieces of laundry:

160 sheets + 80 comforters + 320 pillow cases + 640 towels = 1200 pieces of laundry

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps carefully:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.
2. Determine how many pencils were used after two months.
3. Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.
4. Determine how many pencils were left at the end of the year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.**

There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many pencils were used after two months.**

1/5 of the total pencils were used.
\[ \text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.**

\[ \text{Pencils remaining} = 300 - 60 = 240 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many pencils were left at the end of the year.**

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is:
6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
2 remoras * 0.5 feet/remora = 1 foot

The shark's body length is 10 feet. The percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents is:
(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

2. Number of kids allergic to peanuts: 6
3. Number of kids allergic to both: 3

First, we calculate the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the two items. 

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many are not allergic to anything:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate the total yards used by multiplying \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Then, we add 2 feet to this length to get the length of the couch:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
4. She paid half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.
5. The total amount she paid for all the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
\[ 2S = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 4 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then determine the best combination within his budget.

1. **Cost and Stick Yield:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing Sticks with the Cheapest Lumber:**
   - The cheapest lumber is the 2 x 4 piece of wood, which costs $4.
   - With $24, Frederick can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.
   - Each piece of 2 x 4 wood yields 200 sticks, so 6 pieces will yield \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is 1200.

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for the 6 sled dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day for her bus trips is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total weekly cost without the pass:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

1. From January 1st to July 19th:
   - January has 31 days.
   - February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
   - March has 31 days.
   - April has 30 days.
   - May has 31 days.
   - June has 30 days.
   - July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these together: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

Next, we calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.:
30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit:
105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th.

"To determine how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Each lap is 0.25 km, and she needs to run 8 laps. 

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Next, we calculate the amount of water she needs to drink based on the total distance. Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.

Total water needed = Total distance × Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 ml of water.

"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, Julie has:

$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

So, after buying CDs, Julie has:

$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

Therefore, the total amount including the tip is $50 + $10 = $60. Since you are splitting the check evenly but also paying the entire tip, you pay half of the original bill plus the full tip. This means you pay $25 (half of $50) + $10 (the tip) = $35.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total amount of money shared among the 3 boys is $18.
2. Each boy gets an equal share, so each boy receives $18 / 3 = $6.
3. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.
4. The following day, he adds another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.
5. He then spends $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.
6. He triples the amount he has left after spending, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

The final amount the eldest boy has is $39.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the savings for each half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
   - He saves twice as much each day in the second half, so he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of April to meet his target.

"To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we first calculate the total earnings for each of them based on the number of tasks completed and the payment per task.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task. Since he completed 20 tasks, his total earnings are:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny earns $0.5 per task. Since she also completed 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's total earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \). The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To solve this, let's break down Elise's writing process:

1. First, she writes the full alphabet twice. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice means:
   \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so:
   \(13 \times 1 = 13\) letters.

3. Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters. Rewriting all of these means:
   \(65 \times 1 = 65\) letters.

Adding all these together gives the total number of letters Elise has written:
\(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. In a phone tree, each person calls a fixed number of other people, and this process repeats in rounds.

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount:

- Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50 per notebook = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens * $0.25 per pen = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00 per calculator = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00 per geometry set = $10.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, so we calculate the discount amount:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, when the water is warm, he swims a mile in:
\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

- In cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

- In warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"First, let's determine Susan's weight. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we calculate:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, we calculate Bob's weight. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:

Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, we find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs. 

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles needed:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. 

The percentage increase can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. If Maggie's recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature \( T \) that, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees.

We can set up the equation:
\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ T = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Adding the durations of both movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

"To find the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses, we first need to determine the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate the value of Juan's house as follows:

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house value:
   \( 30\% \) of \( \$76,000 \) = \( 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800 \)

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
   \( \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200 \)

3. Add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house to get the combined value:
   \( \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200 \)

The combined value of the two houses is:
\$129,200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, which means she bought 12 cups.
2. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought by Judy and her friend: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought by Judy and her friend: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding these together gives the total number of utensils:

- Total utensils: \(52 + 68 = 120\)

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount. 

The original price for 2 boxes is:
2 boxes * $100.00/box = $200.00

The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is:
10% of $200.00 = 0.10 * $200.00 = $20.00

The total cost after the discount is:
$200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Next, we need to determine the total number of contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

Since each box lasts 45 days, 2 boxes will last:
2 * 45 days = 90 days

Now, to find the cost per contact:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00/contact

Since each contact is used once per day, the cost per pair of contacts (one for each eye) is:
$1.00/contact * 2 contacts/pair = $2.00/pair

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
\]

Combining the terms on the left side:

\[
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 3B
\]

So,

\[
3B = 4500
\]

Solving for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
\]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

\[
\text{Red jelly beans} = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
\]

\[
\text{Green jelly beans} = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
\]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:

\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]

Thus, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the average of Jared's three typing speed measurements, we first need to determine the third measurement. Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM, and it increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his speed by another 5 WPM, his new speed will be:

52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we have the three measurements:
1. 47 WPM
2. 52 WPM
3. 57 WPM

To find the average, we sum these measurements and divide by the number of measurements:

(47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3 = 156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Determine the total amount of protein John consumes in one week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so the amount of protein he gets per day is 6 grams. Over a week (7 days), the total protein intake is:
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to pay after his deposit.

1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work:
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - He needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
   - The porcelain crown for one of the implants costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

2. Subtract the deposit from the total cost to find out how much more George needs to pay:
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

3. Determine how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount:
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - The number of hours he needs to work is \(3900 \div 15 = 260\) hours.

3/4 * 120 pounds = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds

For Marissa:

90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

Finally, we add the total amounts made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total production for the day:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate his earnings for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the first four hours were \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50 \text{ per cup} = \$7.50 \text{ per hour} \).
- Over four hours, his total earnings were \( 4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50 \text{ per hour} = \$30.00 \).

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the next two hours were \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60 \text{ per cup} = \$6.00 \text{ per hour} \).
- Over two hours, his total earnings were \( 2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00 \text{ per hour} = \$12.00 \).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00.

Thus, Patrick earned a total of \$42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.
3. Calculate how many months the tires will last.
4. Convert the number of months into years.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 3: Calculate how many months the tires will last.**

To find out how many months the tires will last, divide the total number of rotations the tires can handle by the number of rotations per month:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

**Step 4: Convert the number of months into years.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced in 6 years.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total amount of water used for these loads.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used.

First, we know Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Next, each load uses 20 gallons of water, so:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so:

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in one day.
2. Divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day to find out how many days it will take to sell all the meat.

First, we calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.
- Therefore, the total amount of meat he sells in one day is \( 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \).

Next, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
- The bull weighs 750 kg.
- Prince sells 150 kg of meat per day.
- Therefore, the number of days it will take to sell the meat is \( \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cars towed over the week. 

First, we calculate the number of cars towed for the first three days:
- Each of the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.
- Therefore, for three days, the total number of cars is \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \) cars.

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed for the remaining four days:
- On each of these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than 10, which is \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) cars per day.
- Therefore, for four days, the total number of cars is \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) cars.

Finally, we add the totals from the first three days and the last four days to get the total number of cars towed for the week:
- Total cars towed = \( 30 + 24 = 54 \) cars.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height requirement of 4 feet is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches. We can set up the equation:

40 inches + 2 inches/year * number of years = 48 inches

Solving for the number of years:

2 inches/year * number of years = 48 inches - 40 inches
2 inches/year * number of years = 8 inches
number of years = 8 inches / 2 inches/year
number of years = 4

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to calculate the cost per class based on the number of classes he attends.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The maximum cost per class allowed by his parents is $10.
3. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6.
4. To find out how many classes he can miss, we need to find the point where the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny attends as \( x \). The cost per class is then \( \frac{60}{x} \).

We need to solve for \( x \) when \( \frac{60}{x} = 10 \):
\[ 60 = 10x \]
\[ x = 6 \]

This means Manny can attend 6 classes before the cost per class reaches $10. Therefore, he can miss \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Sales from red hats in the first month = $400
   - Sales from green hats in the first month = 2 * $400 = $800

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
   - Sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200 = $900

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month

"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, let's break down the costs:

1. James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.
2. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
3. The first paid hour costs $15.
4. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each paid hour:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $15 * 2 = $30
- Third hour: $30 * 2 = $60

Now, let's sum up the costs:

"To determine how much of Sally's wage was withheld, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally should have in her bank account if she received her full wage.
2. Subtract the actual amount in her bank account from this total to find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount Sally should have in her bank account if she received her full wage:
- Initial amount in the bank account: $200
- Weekly wage: $300
- Total amount if full wage was received: $200 + $300 = $500

Next, we subtract the actual amount in her bank account from this total:

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \( 3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves} \)

2. Determine the number of whole eggs required:
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 halves.
   \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \)

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \( \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \)

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we first calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total days to complete reading} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

The assignment is due in 30 days, so we subtract the number of days Mike needs to read from the total number of days available:

\[ \text{Days before the deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. **Initial cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly fuel expenses**: Twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Hanger rental + Fuel expenses
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost = Initial cost + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's break down the cooking times for each item:

1. **Rice**: It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. **Pork**: It took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. Therefore, the cooking time for the pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Beans**: The beans took half the combined cooking time of the pork and rice. The combined cooking time of the pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the cooking time for the beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times of the rice, pork, and beans:
\[
30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total cooking time for all the food is 120 minutes.

- 1/2 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( S = 15 \).

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we will convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches
So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

The bamboo needs to grow to 600 inches. The current height is 240 inches, so the additional growth needed is:
600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the total additional growth needed by the daily growth rate:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

The total cost for the four candies can be found by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This $1.20 is the cost for four candies, so the cost per candy is:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00

The cost for 10 candies is:

10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives the total cost:

$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves an additional 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month.

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, ten years is 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong's total savings over ten years:
20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins

Neil's total savings over ten years:
28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins

Finally, we add Rong's and Neil's total savings to find the combined total:
2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins

"First, let's determine the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we can write:
\[ \text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

"To calculate the total price of the crate, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas**: Each banana costs twice as much as an apple. Since an apple costs $0.5, a banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of apples**: Each apple costs $0.5.
   - The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of oranges**: Each orange costs three times as much as a banana. Since a banana costs $1.0, an orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits to get the total price of the crate:
\[ 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = \$32.0 \]

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: The problem states there are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter in square feet is the same as the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is:

"First, let's determine the number of points each student has collected.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   - 30% of 50 points is \( 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \) points.
   - Therefore, Betty has \( 50 + 15 = 65 \) points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Therefore, Tom has \( 65 - 30 = 35 \) points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Therefore, Martha has \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \) points.

Next, let's calculate the total points collected by the class:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Martha: 105 points

Total points = \( 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \) points.

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat, and each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Therefore, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ seats} \times 2 \text{ drinks/seat} = 40 \text{ drinks} \]
\[ 20 \text{ seats} \times 3 \text{ snacks/seat} = 60 \text{ snacks} \]

The total number of drinks and snacks combined is:

\[ 40 \text{ drinks} + 60 \text{ snacks} = 100 \text{ items} \]

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost is:

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the cost of the damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed with the total cost of fixing the pothole himself.

1. Cost of damage to the car if the pothole is not fixed: $450
2. Cost of fixing the pothole:
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75
   - Total cost of fixing the pothole: $120 + $75 = $195

Now, we calculate the savings:
- Savings = Cost of damage - Cost of fixing the pothole
- Savings = $450 - $195 = $255

Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs originally available.

First, calculate the total number of chairs originally:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 chairs

Next, calculate the total number of chairs sent for repair:
20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs

Now, subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
193 chairs - 33 chairs = 160 chairs

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pizzas**: Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, so there are 5 pizzas in total.
2. **Slices per pizza**: Each pizza has 12 slices.
3. **Total slices of pizza**: \( 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices} \).

Next, we need to calculate how many slices each group of friends ate:

1. **Bryce and two friends**:
   - Each of these three friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
   - Slices eaten by each of these three friends: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \).
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \).

2. **The two remaining friends**:
   - Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
   - Slices eaten by each of these two friends: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \).
   - Total slices eaten by the two remaining friends: \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:

- Total slices eaten: \( 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \).

Finally, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

- Total slices left: \( 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \).

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by the number of animals:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:
96 + 4 = 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. The equation based on the problem statement is:
100 = 9x + 10

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
100 - 10 = 9x
90 = 9x
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

Total windows in students' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Windows smashed in students' cars:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

Total windows in teachers' cars:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Windows smashed in teachers' cars:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   \[
   \text{Number of small shirts} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]
3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   \[
   \text{Number of medium shirts} = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]
4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   \[
   \text{Number of large shirts} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   \[
   \text{Number of extra-large shirts} = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, let's add up all the shirts:
\[
\text{Total number of shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
\]

"To determine how many cases of shingles the third house will need, we can set up the problem with the given information:

Let \( x \) be the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
- The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish.
3. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( 17 - x \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

After buying the fish, the total number of white fish Bob has is:
\[ 4 + x \]

The total number of orange fish Bob has is:
\[ 3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x \]

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 20 - x = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 20 - x = 8 + 2x \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2x + x \]
\[ 12 = 3x \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill he uses to pay.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The original price of the jeans is $40.
   - The discount is 25% of $40.
   - Discount amount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10.

2. Calculate the discounted price:
   - Discounted price = Original price - Discount amount = $40 - $10 = $30.

3. Calculate the change Mike will receive:
   - Mike pays with a $50 bill.
   - Change = $50 - Discounted price = $50 - $30 = $20.

So, Mike will have $20 left over.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Adding these to the initial 200 employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid over three months.**

\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of this total, so we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. She plays for half an hour every day, so for 14 days, that's:

0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours

Next, for the following week, she plays for 2 hours every day, so for 7 days, that's:

2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played:

7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic he can create with those chips.
3. Use the height of the mosaic to find out how many inches long it can be.

First, calculate the total number of glass chips:
Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, determine how many square inches of mosaic he can create with 144 chips:
It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of mosaic.
\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips per square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, use the height of the mosaic to find out how many inches long it can be:
Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall.
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Height} \times \text{Length} \]
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} = 3 \text{ inches} \times \text{Length} \]
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ s + 2s + z + z + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ s + 2s + 2z + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 5s + 2z = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \):
\[ 5(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 12z = 10 \]
\[ z = \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6} \]

Now, find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Finally, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]

Converting to a decimal for clarity:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

However, the exact answer in ounces is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = \$32 \times 0.75 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Milly's initial cost for the book was $32.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3 = \$11
     \]

Milly will lose $11.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has.
2. Use the amount Anthony has to find out how much Roy has.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Roy's total savings are:
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Finally, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
\[
480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{2v}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D = 54v \) into the equation:
     \[
     T = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ P + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ P + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ P + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 350 - 230 \]
\[ P = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many apple slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he makes from the apples.

1. Calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
   - Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
   - Adam slices 3 large apples.
   - Total slices from large apples = 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices.

2. Calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
   - Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
   - Adam slices 5 small apples.
   - Total slices from small apples = 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices.

3. Calculate the total number of slices:
   - Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples = 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices.

4. Determine how many slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production with the current number of cows. 

The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total milk production per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English. 

First, we know:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students are good at English only.
- The total number of students in the class is 20.

The number of students who are good at both math and English can be found by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for (3 years).

First, calculate the annual interest rate as a decimal:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is buying:

1. The total cost of the 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.
2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.
3. The total cost for the 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.
4. Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
5. The total cost for the 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
6. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.
7. The total cost for the 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first account for the 15-minute encore in the final concert. Subtracting the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert gives us the length of the main part of the final concert. 

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, and the encore is 15 minutes:
65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

This 50 minutes is twice the length of her usual concerts. Therefore, to find the length of her usual concerts, we divide this time by 2:
50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

2. She mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's in the first week.
3. She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's in the second week.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

First, we need to determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid $6, and assuming this is the total amount for the month, we can infer that this is the payment for the lawn mowing services provided to Joe.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

From the information given:
- In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.

   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel read 0 pages today.

3. **Total pages read:**
   - Denise's total pages read: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
   - Daniel's total pages read: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

4. **Difference in pages read:**
   - The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

Thus, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, and everyone eats one bowl at a meal, we need to determine how many bowls of soup will be left for the children to have for lunch.

First, we calculate the total number of bowls of soup used for dinner:
- 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife)
- 2 child bowls (for the two children)

So, the total number of bowls used for dinner is:
2 (adult) + 2 (child) = 4 bowls

Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, and 4 bowls are used for dinner, the number of child bowls left is:
8 - 4 = 4 child bowls

Each child will be able to have:
4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 bowls per child

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50. William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50. William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

Therefore, William spent $8.00 in all.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on various activities and subtract this from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours a day.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities: \(10 + 8 + 1 = 19\) hours

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( D = 60 \)
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
3. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To determine how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we first need to calculate the number of packages he completes per hour. According to the problem, Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Since Colby earns $0.20 for every package he completes, we can now calculate his total earnings for the day:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which means he drinks 1 bottle every 30 minutes.
2. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. During this time, he would drink:
   - 45 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 1.5 bottles
3. An extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal Sudoku, so:
   - 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes
4. In 180 minutes, the number of bottles he drinks is:
   - 180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of red balloons and the bologna thrown at them:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - There are 20 red balloons.
   - Total bologna thrown at red balloons: \( 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \).

2. **Determine the total bologna thrown at yellow balloons:**
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - Bologna thrown at red balloons: 40 pieces.
   - Bologna thrown at yellow balloons: \( 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces at red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces} \).

3. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Total bologna thrown at yellow balloons: \( 3y = 18 \).
   - Solving for \( y \): \( y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first calculate the total miles driven in that month. Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Next, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals are in 3000 miles, since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons. 
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they each received the same amount, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the total profit raised by the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
\[ \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

The class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find out how many pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:
   \[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7 \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so:
   \[ \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish he has, so:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For the additional 5 hours, he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

The total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, it would have cost him 1600 pesos. The amount of money Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately.

1. Calculate the hay needed for the goats:
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. Calculate the hay needed for the sheep:
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total hay needed:
   - Total hay = hay for goats + hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spends on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time for the initial swim: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swimming time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time for the remaining swim:**
   - Time for the remaining swim: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - For 6 copies, the total commission = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two more equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equations for \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

2. Determine the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day.
3. Use the information that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day. The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

This means the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 40. Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon: \( A + S + W = 339 \).
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( A = S + 5 \).
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: \( S = 4W - 13 \).

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( W = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4W - 13 \):

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.
   - Since this is in the opposite direction, we subtract this distance from the total southerly distance.
   - Net distance after the second leg = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles.

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.
   - Add this distance to the net distance after the second leg.
   - Total net distance = 264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes.

Now, we find out how many boxes she has left after giving some away:
- 12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes.

Mrs. Harrington then kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges:
- 1/4 of 8 boxes = 2 boxes.

This means she sold the rest of the boxes:
- 8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is:
- 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

The total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine his dad's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

3. **Determine his dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

4. **Determine his brother's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Therefore, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

5. **Determine his brother's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now:**
   - Dad's current age: 43 years
   - Brother's current age: 7 years

"To determine the total number of servings Joe has, we first need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days.

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving to find the number of servings:
\[
\frac{21}{3} = 7
\]

Therefore, the total number of servings Joe has is:

"First, let's determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players are accounted for:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flower bed to inches:**
   - 111 feet = 111 * 12 inches = 1332 inches

2. **Determine the total space each plant and the space between plants will occupy:**
   - Each plant is 12 inches wide.
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between it and the next plant.
   - Total space per plant including the gap: 12 inches (plant) + 18 inches (gap) = 30 inches

3. **Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - Total number of plants = 1332 inches / 30 inches per plant = 44.4
   - Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - Additional plants needed = 44 - 17 = 27 plants

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the tasks and calculate the time for each.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook:
     \[
     \text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time to peel and the time to cook:

   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total number of ""kid-sized"" slices. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as a kid's slice, we can think of each adult's slice as being equivalent to 2 kid-sized slices. Therefore, the 2 adults together get the equivalent of 4 kid-sized slices. Adding the 4 actual kid-sized slices, we have a total of 8 kid-sized slices.

Since the watermelon is divided into 8 equal parts (in terms of kid-sized slices), each part represents 1/8 of the watermelon. Each adult gets 2 of these parts, so each adult gets 2/8 or 1/4 of the watermelon.

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we calculate:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Matteo's time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Shandy's time: 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
- Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the number of female students in each age group.

1. **Total Students**: 3000
2. **Students Over 16 Years Old**: Half of 3000 = 1500
3. **Students Under 16 Years Old**: The remaining half of 3000 = 1500

Next, we calculate the number of male and female students in each age group.

**Students Over 16 Years Old**:
- **Male Students Over 16**: One-fourth of 1500 = 1500 / 4 = 375
- **Female Students Over 16**: The remaining students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125

**Students Under 16 Years Old**:
- **Male Students Under 16**: One-half of 1500 = 1500 / 2 = 750
- **Female Students Under 16**: The remaining students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

Finally, we add the number of female students from both age groups to get the total number of female students.

- **Total Female Students**: 1125 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1875

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \): \( x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44 \).

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is approximately 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \): \( y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44 \).

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save. 

1. Calculate the down payment amount:
   \[
   \text{Down payment} = 20\% \text{ of } \$10,000 = 0.20 \times 10,000 = \$2,000
   \]

2. Calculate Janet's total earnings per hour:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per hour} = \$10 \text{ (wages)} + \$15 \text{ (tips)} = \$25
   \]

3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = \$25 \text{ per hour} \times 40 \text{ hours} = \$1,000
   \]

4. Determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save \$2,000:
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add up these amounts to find the total spent so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve this, we first determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums with an equal number of pictures in each, we divide 72 by 8:

72 / 8 = 9 pictures per album.

Next, we need to find out how many of these pictures were selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits, we calculate the total number of pictures in these albums:

Selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures.
Portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures.

Adding these together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

27 + 18 = 45 pictures.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we first need to determine the rate at which he reads. James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, so his reading rate is:

\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we need to calculate how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can set up the proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{18 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]
\[ x = \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{3} \]
\[ x = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the changes in the number of guests accordingly.

1. Initially, the hotel was fully booked with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests opted for a late checkout, but they are still counted as guests until they actually leave, so the number of guests remains:
   \[
   76
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 new guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   76 + 30 = 106

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the pricing pattern based on the given information. The first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6. 

We can see that the price per sandwich is consistent across the first two packages:
- For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
- For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich should remain the same for the third package. Therefore, for the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and then figure out how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new income.

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total loans = 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   - Jim had a $25,000 a year job before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn:**
   - Total amount = Total loans + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = 3 * $25,000/year = $75,000/year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total amount:**
   - Total amount to earn = $300,000.
   - New income per year = $75,000.
   - Time to earn the total amount = $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of each piece of fabric is:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

The width of each piece of fabric is:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) × 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
80 square feet (area of one piece) × 2 = 160 square feet

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's deliveries: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's deliveries: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209
   - Total: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for this calculation.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \). According to the problem, the second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars, and the third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter.

First, calculate the total number of days worked:
- 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Next, determine the fraction of a day worked each day:
- Each day, the team worked 3/8 of a day.

Convert the fraction of a day to hours:
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 3/8 of a day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Calculate the total hours worked by the team:
- Total hours = 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours

Finally, divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:
- Each painter worked = 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ V = P (1 - r)^n \]
where:
- \( V \) is the value after \( n \) years,
- \( P \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( n = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ V = 20000 (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 (0.79)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ V \approx 9860.78 \]

The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To determine how much money Maggie and Riza have left after their expenditures, we first calculate how much each of them spent and then subtract that from their initial amounts.

Maggie initially had $60. She spent a quarter of her money:
\[ \text{Maggie's expenditure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, Maggie has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also initially had $60. She spent one-third of her money:
\[ \text{Riza's expenditure} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, Riza has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Adding the remaining amounts of both Maggie and Riza:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Thus, the total amount of money they have left is:

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a week and then break it down by each monkey's daily consumption.

1. **Total bananas for the week:**
   - Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.

2. **Daily consumption of the first monkey:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - Over a week (7 days), the first monkey eats: \( 10 \times 7 = 70 \) bananas.

3. **Daily consumption of the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - Therefore, the second monkey eats \( 10 + 4 = 14 \) bananas each day.
   - Over a week, the second monkey eats: \( 14 \times 7 = 98 \) bananas.

4. **Total consumption of the first and second monkeys for the week:**
   - Combined, the first and second monkeys eat: \( 70 + 98 = 168 \) bananas in a week.

5. **Daily consumption of the third monkey:**
   - The total number of bananas for the week is 315.
   - The third monkey eats the remaining bananas after the first and second monkeys have eaten.
   - The third monkey eats: \( 315 - 168 = 147 \) bananas in a week.
   - Therefore, the third monkey eats: \( \frac{147}{7} = 21 \) bananas each day.

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 15 roses. Since the price is $15 for a dozen, we can determine the cost for 15 roses by noting that 15 roses are 1 dozen and 3 additional roses. The cost for 1 dozen roses is $15, and the cost for 3 additional roses at $2 each is 3 * $2 = $6. Therefore, the total cost for 15 roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which totals 5 * $5 = $25. After spending $21 on the roses, she has $25 - $21 = $4 left.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters.

   - Leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it leaves 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during the month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total number of bikes sold**: 300
2. **Number of Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes
   \[
   \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
3. **Number of BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes
   \[
   \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
   \]
4. **Number of MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes
   \[
   \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- **Price of one MTB**: $500
- **Price of one BMX**: Half the price of an MTB
  \[
  \text{Price of one BMX} = \frac{500}{2} = 250
  \]
- **Price of one Trekking bike**: $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from MTB bikes} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
  \]
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from BMX bikes} = 45 \times 250 = 11250

"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a week. He has 6 periods each day for 5 days, plus 2 extra classes each day for 5 days:

\[ 6 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} + 2 \text{ extra classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ periods/week} + 10 \text{ periods/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total minutes spent in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly class time each day on extra learning:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time over the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the extra learning time to the regular class time gives the total weekly learning time in minutes:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms left after the velociraptors had their share.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms of meat.

Thus, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:

   - The discounted price of the set of towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations:

Initial charge: $85.00
After return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
Frying pan: $16.00
Set of towels: $27.00
New balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement period, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and how much she can save each year.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement income needed:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Current annual salary: $100,000
   - Annual retirement income needed: \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \)

2. **Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement savings needed: \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \)

3. **Calculate the annual savings:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Annual savings: \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \)

4. **Determine the number of years needed to save the total amount:**
   - Total savings needed: $800,000
   - Annual savings: $20,000
   - Number of years needed: \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \)

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her 20-year retirement.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, so we divide this by 4:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Each of these 25 cm parts must then be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 cm by 5:

\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, you need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

There are three women wearing 4-inch heels and three women wearing 2-inch heels. 

First, calculate the total height of the heels:
- Total height of 4-inch heels: 3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches
- Total height of 2-inch heels: 3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches

Now, add these totals together to get the overall total height:
- Total height of all heels: 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

Next, divide the total height by the number of women to find the average height:
- Number of women: 3 + 3 = 6
- Average height of heels: 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and the total miles she plans to hike daily.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes 125 miles twice a day, she will hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The additional miles she needs to hike are:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance John drives to visit his parents.
2. Determine the total distance for a round trip.
3. Calculate the total distance driven in a month, considering he visits his parents twice a month.

Step 1: Calculate the one-way distance.
- John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive to his parents' house.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- One-way distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

Step 2: Determine the total distance for a round trip.
- A round trip includes the distance to his parents' house and back.
- Round trip distance = One-way distance × 2
- Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance driven in a month.
- John visits his parents twice a month.
- Total monthly distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits per month
- Total monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's break down the information and calculate step by step.

1. **Total toys needed**: 400 toys.
2. **Toys still needed after the shift**: 20 toys.
3. **Toys produced during the shift**: 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Next, we calculate the total production by the first four workers:

- **Two workers producing 6 toys per hour**: 
  - Each worker produces 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 60 toys.
  - Two workers produce 60 toys * 2 = 120 toys.

- **Two workers producing 4 toys per hour**: 
  - Each worker produces 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 40 toys.
  - Two workers produce 40 toys * 2 = 80 toys.

Total production by the first four workers:
- 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

Now, we find out how many toys the fifth worker produced:
- Total toys produced during the shift: 380 toys.
- Toys produced by the first four workers: 200 toys.
- Toys produced by the fifth worker: 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys.

Finally, we calculate the production rate of the fifth worker:
- The fifth worker produced 180 toys in 10 hours.
- Production rate: 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

4. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs**: Let's denote the number of eggs each painted by \( A \). Therefore, \( 2A = 26 \), so \( A = 13 \).

5. **Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah**:
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
   - Solving for \( S \), \( 2S = 18 \), so \( S = 9 \).
   - Therefore, Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

6. **How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold**:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we know that her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 1 \text{ mile} \times 10 \text{ minutes per mile} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time for the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of marbles Bob has:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after combining it with the water from the 33-degree mug.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The final temperature of the mixture in Donny's water bottle as \( T_f \).

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water. The final temperature \( T_f \) can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures:

\[
T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T_f = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

Donny can drink the water if \( T_f \geq 40 \). Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T \), multiply both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we first calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the discount applied, and then divide that total by the number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   \( 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \)

2. Apply the 10% discount:
   \( 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \)
   \( \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \)

3. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   \( 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \)

4. Calculate the cost per bagel:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
- Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
- \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know from the problem that:
- It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
- \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
- \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
- If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \( x \) potatoes make 18 scoops.
- \( \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \).

Solving for \( x \):
- \( x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} \)
- \( x = \frac{54}{2} \)
- \( x = 27 \).

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to consider both the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers included in the bouquets.

1. Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
   - Number of individual sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

2. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

3. Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

4. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = individual sunflowers + sunflowers in bouquets = 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many bottles are currently produced.
3. Find the difference between the required number of bottles and the current production.

First, we know that each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the required production:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   R = 4B
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   B = Y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   R + B + Y = 37
   \]

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[
4B + B + Y = 37
\]
\[
5B + Y = 37
\]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
\]
\[
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
\]
\[
6Y - 35 = 37
\]
\[
6Y = 72
\]
\[
Y = 12

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[
B = Y - 7
\]
\[
B = 12 - 7
\]
\[
B = 5

2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's denote the amount of money each gave to their little sister as \(x\).

3. After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
4. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15

3. **Wednesday**: She counts double the number from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She counts double the number from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She counts double the number from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday is 93.

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the special size box and then find out the cost per pod.

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. Calculate how many pods you can get for $1:
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 is 10.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   - Number of $20 bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   - Remaining bills = 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Bills used to pay = 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
   - Remaining bills = 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money.
   - Value of remaining bills = 20 bills * $20 = $400.
   - Tripling the money = $400 * 3 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his money to $5 bills.
   - Number of $5 bills = $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. Total goals scored by each team:
   - Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.

4. Total number of goals scored in the match:
   - \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches.

1. **Initial length of the chalk on Monday:** 5 inches.
2. **Percentage of chalk used on Monday:** 45%.
3. **Length of chalk used on Monday:** \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
4. **Length of chalk left after Monday:** \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

Next, we need to determine how much chalk is used each subsequent day and how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

5. **Percentage of chalk used each day after Monday:** 20%.
6. **Length of chalk used each day after Monday:** \( 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \) inches.

We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches. We can set up the following equation to find the number of days, \( n \):

\[ 2.75 - 0.55n < 2 \]

Solving for \( n \):

\[ 2.75 - 2 < 0.55n \]
\[ 0.75 < 0.55n \]
\[ n > \frac{0.75}{0.55} \]
\[ n > 1.3636 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 more days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students who are on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

So, the total number of students on varsity is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

The total number of students in the class is:

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 (capped)

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 (total fixed)

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, we solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her friends and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Total cheese slices consumed = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Next, calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Total pepperoni slices consumed = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes the snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs**: Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.
2. **Rate of melting snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in one hour.

Therefore, the net rate of snowball accumulation per hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, we use the net rate:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine the year Digimon came out. Since it had its 20th anniversary, we can calculate the year it was released by subtracting 20 from the current year. Assuming the current year is 2023:
   \[
   2023 - 20 = 2003
   \]
   So, Digimon came out in 2003.

2. Determine John's age when Digimon came out. John is 28 years old now, so in 2003, he was:
   \[
   28 - (2023 - 2003) = 28 - 20 = 8

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

4. **End of the Third Day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days and then determine the initial number of bandages.

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

- **Net change in bandages:**
  - Total ordered - Total used = \(150 - 91 = 59\) bandages.

- **Bandages at the end of the third day:**
  - They had 78 bandages left.

- **Initial number of bandages:**
  - Let \(x\) be the initial number of bandages.
  - After the net change, they had \(x + 59\) bandages.
  - At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages.
  - Therefore, \(x + 59 = 78\).

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

The house is 7 times as high as Mattison, who is 60 inches tall.
\[ \text{Total height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Step 2: Determine the height of the first floor.
The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison.
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Step 3: Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.
\[ \text{Height from the second floor's floor to the roof} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 40\% \times 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \text{ shells} \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \text{ shells} \]

Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 60\% \times 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells} \]

Finally, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is the remaining shells after both team Alphas and team The Finders have found theirs:

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance is 3 miles per day for 4 dogs, which means the total distance walked by all dogs together is:

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We know the distances for the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these distances together gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"First, we need to calculate the amount of the loan John gets, which is 40% of the value of his home. The value of his home is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, we calculate how much of this loan he uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money he has left over after paying off his debts by subtracting the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money left over} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters per day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed from all settings:

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of each school individually.

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.
   - Since Ali is the dean and teaches only one class, the total capacity of Ali's school is 120 students.

2. **John's School:**
   - Each of John's classes has a capacity of 1/8 of Ali's class.
   - Therefore, the capacity of each of John's classes is \( \frac{120}{8} = 15 \) students.
   - John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's school is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) students.

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of the capacities of Ali's school and John's school.
   - Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150 students.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first calculate the total number of diaper changes for both children. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and Jordan has 2 children:

5 diaper changes/child/day * 2 children = 10 diaper changes/day

Jordan's wife changes half of these diapers, so she changes:

10 diaper changes/day * 1/2 = 5 diaper changes/day

This means Jordan changes the other half:

10 diaper changes/day - 5 diaper changes/day = 5 diaper changes/day

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Calculate the cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Calculate the new cost of one visit after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.

3. **Calculate the cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

4. **Calculate the total cost for all visits:**

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds needed for 80 meatballs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all the classrooms:
   - Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean.
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - Total time required = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

2. Convert the total workday into minutes:
   - An 8-hour workday = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

3. Calculate the total time the custodian works over 5 days:
   - Total work time over 5 days = 5 days * 480 minutes/day = 2400 minutes.

4. Determine the average time spent cleaning per day:
   - Total cleaning time = 1200 minutes.
   - Average cleaning time per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day.

5. Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, we need to determine how many eggs she has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs:

Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how much she will sell these eggs for. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs.

Total revenue = (60 eggs / 3 eggs) * $1 = 20 * $1 = $20.00

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

"To find out how many white hats Skyler has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of hats**: 100
2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the total hats are red, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]
3. **Remaining hats after red**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats:
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]
4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]
5. **Number of white hats**: The rest of the hats are white, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = \text{Remaining hats} - \text{Number of blue hats} = 50 - 30 = 20

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Using Vanessa's speed, the time to run 4 miles is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, the total required line is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes a week from reservations, we need to calculate the total revenue from each reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations per night and the number of days the restaurant is open each week.

1. Calculate the total revenue from one reservation:
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each and one bottle of wine at $5.
   - Total cost per reservation = (2 meals * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15.

2. Calculate the total revenue per night:
   - The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - Total revenue per night = 6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90.

3. Calculate the total revenue per week:
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Total revenue per week = 2 days * $90 per night = $180.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost price of the watermelons:
   Total cost price = $80

2. Calculate the total profit:
   Profit percentage = 25%
   Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

3. Calculate the total selling price:
   Total selling price = Total cost price + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old, so John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.

Cost of the radiator after discount:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

Cost of the mechanic's labor:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- Each chicken has 2 legs.
- Each cow has 4 legs.
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To determine how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices.
