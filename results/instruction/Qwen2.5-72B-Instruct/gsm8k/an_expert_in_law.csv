"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs and then subtract his total costs from this value.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: $80,000
2. **Cost of Repairs**: $50,000
3. **Total Costs**: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house:

1. **Original Value of the House**: $80,000
2. **Increase in Value**: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
3. **New Value of the House**: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, we calculate the profit:

1. **Profit**: New Value of the House - Total Costs = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Total feed needed = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken per day
   Total feed needed = 20 chickens × 3 cups/chicken
   Total feed needed = 60 cups

3. Calculate the total amount of feed already given to the chickens:
   Feed given in the morning = 15 cups
   Feed given in the afternoon = 25 cups
   Total feed given = 15 cups + 25 cups
   Total feed given = 40 cups

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed - Total feed given
   Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups
   Feed needed for the final meal = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar's purchase of 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass and every second glass:
- The cost of the first glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass is $3 (60% of $5).

Since this pattern repeats every two glasses, we can calculate the cost for each pair of glasses:
- Cost for one pair (first and second glass) = $5 + $3 = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs of glasses:
- Total cost for 8 pairs = 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before selling at the orange house, she had \(5 \times 2 = 10\) vacuum cleaners.
2. Before selling at the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners, which means that the 10 vacuum cleaners were what remained after selling 2 more to the red house. Therefore, before selling to the red house, she had \(10 + 2 = 12\) vacuum cleaners.
3. Before selling to the red house, she had 12 vacuum cleaners, which means that the 12 vacuum cleaners were what remained after selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If 12 vacuum cleaners represent the remaining two-thirds after selling a third, then the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is \(12 \div (2/3) = 12 \times (3/2) = 18\).

Thus, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S = 40 \)), we can find the number of gold coins (\( G \)) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   Therefore, Aaron has 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each segment of his ping pong play and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
- Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we sum the points from both segments:
- Points in the first 20 minutes: 4 points
- Points in the second 20 minutes: 5 points

Total points scored: \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distances she covers in the given time.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance covered while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance covered while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine the number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.**

- The bag has 5 servings.
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

**Step 2: Determine the number of calories you can still consume.**

- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Calories you can still consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

**Step 3: Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.**

- Each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g.
- Therefore, each serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60g.
- To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we use the ratio of calories to grams:
  - 250 calories = 60g
  - 1 calorie = 60g / 250 calories = 0.24g
  - 200 calories = 200 * 0.24g = 48g

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. **Post-it notes used**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
3. **Post-it notes remaining**: After placing the Post-it notes on the cups, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes Candice had before using them is the sum of the initial Post-it notes and the Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

The number of Post-it notes used is 220, and the number of Post-it notes remaining is 23. Therefore, the equation representing the total number of Post-it notes is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   - Cost of each blue tie = $40
   - Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on all ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   - Total spent on all ties = $200 + $600 = $800

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is $800.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

"To determine how many potted plants Mary will have remaining, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.
2. Subtract the number of potted plants she will give away.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

Next, add the 18 new potted plants she received:
- Total potted plants = 80 (existing) + 18 (new) = 98.

Now, calculate the number of potted plants she will give away:
- She will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the number of potted plants she will give away is 40.

Finally, subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she has:
- Remaining potted plants = 98 - 40 = 58.

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 58.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\right) = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of doorbell rings:

"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

He has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time based on the rate at which the fog bank moves and the distance it needs to cover.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the fog bank's movement is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

The city is 42 miles across. To find the total time required to cover 42 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times 3.3333 \]
\[ \text{Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To determine how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, Henry intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.
5. We can set up the equation: \( 2x + 15 = 115 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
2x + 15 = 115
\]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of containers imported on the second day. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Count**: On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
   - Total vehicles on the first day = 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

2. **Total Vehicles After Second Day**: After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port was 30.

3. **Vehicles Added on the Second Day**: The number of vehicles added on the second day can be calculated by subtracting the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles.
   - Vehicles added on the second day = 30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (initial) = 20 vehicles.

4. **Number of Containers on the Second Day**: Each container contains 5 vehicles. Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
   - Number of containers = 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. We can set up the equation:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% from his salary four years ago. Therefore:
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase in Adrien's salary and apply it to Lylah's salary. Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so:
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ 99076.92 \]

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments based on her speed changes.

1. For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: \( 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \)

2. After the first 3 hours, she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (since 7 hours total - 3 hours already run = 4 hours).
   - Distance covered in the next 4 hours: \( 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \)

3. Total distance covered in 7 hours:
   - Total distance = Distance in first 3 hours + Distance in next 4 hours
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

1. **Calculate the total time spent on patients per day:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert the total time spent on patients to hours:**
   - 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Calculate the total cost to the hospital for doctors:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

5. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"To determine how many elves are left after the described events, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of elves**: Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. **Elves who quit after children vomit on them**: A third of the elves quit. 
   - A third of 60 is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \).
   - Therefore, 20 elves quit.
   - Remaining elves: \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

3. **Elves who quit after kids kick their shins**: 10 of the remaining elves quit.
   - Remaining elves: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

Thus, the number of elves left is 30.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all the days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total class hours for the semester:

"To determine the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the water depth on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, the water depth was 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the water depth increased by 7 feet.
   - Therefore, the water depth on Tuesday is:
     \[
     17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the water depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the water depth on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish caught by both and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, let's sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Now, let's add up all the fish:
- Total fish: \(15 + 9 + 8 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is 32.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase interval:**
   - Initial price: $20
   - Increase interval: every 2 months
   - Increase rate: 20% of the original price

2. **Calculate the number of increases over 36 months:**
   - 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

3. **Determine the price after each increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Therefore, each increase adds $4 to the price.

4. **Calculate the total increase over 18 intervals:**
   - Total increase = 18 * $4 = $72

5. **Calculate the final price:**
   - Final price = Initial price + Total increase
   - Final price = $20 + $72 = $92

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be expressed as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost.
4. Calculate the cost of lemons based on the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. They made a profit of $25. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = 3 \text{ (lemons)} + 2 \text{ (sugar)} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made. The total cost is:
\[ C = 5G \]

The total revenue is the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total number of glasses sold is:
\[ \text{Total glasses} = 20G \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \]

Now we can set up the equation for profit:
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 5G \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. This can be written as:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + \frac{28}{2}
     \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
     \[
     \frac{28}{2} = 14
     \]
   - Substitute this into the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + 14
     \]
     \[
     M - 2 = 19
     \]

4. **Solve for \( M \):**
   - Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     M = 19 + 2
     \]
     \[
     M = 21
     \]

5. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

4. **Expressing the result as a percentage:**
   - To convert the ratio to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     2 \times 100 = 200\%
     \]

Therefore, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and the steps needed to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Total Straw Distributed**: 160 pieces of straw.
2. **Straw for Rats**: Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and they are distributed equally among 3 cages.
3. **Straw for Hamsters**: Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 cages, each with one hamster.
4. **Straw for Rabbits**: 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

First, calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces of straw per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Next, calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Now, subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw distributed to find the straw used for the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces of straw} - 50 \text{ pieces of straw} - 20 \text{ pieces of straw} = 90 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces of straw}}{6 \text{ pieces of straw per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Finally, since the rats are distributed equally among 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:

"To determine how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly insect requirement for the flock of ten ducks.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we know that one duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks:
\[ 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees added each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

Step 1: Net number of trees added each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees added each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
\[ 50 + (8 \times 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 \]

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \]

Step 4: Number of trees left
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \]

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Number of flamingos taken back and painted white on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on Sue's front yard.

3. **Number of pink and white flamingos on Saturday morning:**
   - After taking back 6 pink flamingos, 12 pink flamingos remain.
   - 6 white flamingos are added back to the yard.
   - So, on Saturday morning, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

4. **Number of flamingos added on Sunday morning:**
   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

5. **Difference between the number of pink and white flamingos on Sunday noon:**
   - The number of pink flamingos is 30.
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum these weights.

1. **Weight of each chocolate bar:**
   Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.

2. **Total weight of the chocolate bars:**
   Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40\, \text{g} = 1000\, \text{g}
   \]

3. **Weight of each candied apple:**
   Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs:
   \[
   \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40\, \text{g}}{2} = 20\, \text{g}
   \]

4. **Total weight of the candied apples:**
   Joe has 80 candied apples.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20\, \text{g} = 1600\, \text{g}

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the amount needed by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white chickens than red chickens. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter and Gary's walking speed into the formula:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

   - Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   - Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Next, we sum the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, the points scored by Jojo can be found by subtracting the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater collected:
   \[
   30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after the changes, we first need to calculate the new total number of cards and the new number of water type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type
- 20 grass type
- 40 water type

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the new counts are:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The new total number of cards is:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} \]

To convert this to a percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

"To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the slide.
2. Use Anne's number of slides to find out how many times Robert went down the slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of 30, we calculate:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \] times.

Next, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we multiply Anne's number of slides by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Thus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of cows in all the stalls before and after Mr. Sylas buys and distributes the additional cows.

1. Initially, there are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows.
   - Total initial cows = 10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows

2. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls.
   - Additional cows per stall = 40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall

3. After the distribution, each stall will have:
   - Cows per stall = Initial cows per stall + Additional cows per stall
   - Cows per stall = 20 cows + 2 cows = 22 cows

4. To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls:
   - Total cows in 8 stalls = 8 stalls * 22 cows/stall = 176 cows

Thus, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 176.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.**

- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- The number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree is \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) sections.
- Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \times 400 = 8000 \) pounds.

**Step 2: Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.**

- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \) pounds.

**Step 3: Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.**

- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \) pounds.

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the flour needed for today:**
   - Carla is making 36 cookies today.
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up the proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for tomorrow:**
   - Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow.
   - Using the same proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total flour needed:**
   - Total flour = Flour needed for today + Flour needed for tomorrow

   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents. 

1. Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
   \( 5 \times 25 = 125 \) cents.

2. Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
   \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) cents.

3. Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes gives us the total amount of money Kelly has:
   \( 125 + 20 = 145 \) cents.

4. Kelly spends 55 cents on a can of pop. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:

1. Determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.
2. Calculate the total weight of the marbles.

First, let's find out how many marbles Solomon has in total:

- Solomon initially had 50 marbles.
- He bought 20 more marbles from Johanna, so he now has:
  \[
  50 + 20 = 70 \text{ marbles}
  \]

- His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. The number of marbles his father gave him is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
  \]

- Adding the marbles from his father to the total:
  \[
  70 + 8 = 78 \text{ marbles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the marbles. Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight is:
\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Thus, the total number of children in the classroom is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Given that the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of electric poles. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
3x = 45
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. 

Let's denote the number of pencils in each of Jam's boxes as \( x \). Therefore, the equation for the total number of pencils Jam has is:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

We solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid (cream) added.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers × Salary of junior programmers.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 × $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers × Salary of senior programmers.
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = 60 × $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers:**
   - Total payroll for all programmers = Total payroll for junior programmers + Total payroll for senior programmers.
   - Total payroll for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000.

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second stop, there were 20 people on the bus:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the customer had $4 in rewards to use on their current shopping trip. 

Next, the customer used these $4 in rewards and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total discount applied to the current shopping trip is the sum of the rewards and the coupon discount:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip before any discounts. Therefore, the amount they paid after applying the discounts is:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, 2/5 of \( x \) is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can write this as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles Betty has} = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles Sam has} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the second package of fireworks, which is twice the cost of the first package.
2. Add the costs of the two packages together.
3. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages.
4. Add the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total.

Let's break it down:

1. The first package costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice that much: \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is: \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is: \( 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \) dollars.
5. The total cost of the two packages after the discount is: \( 1200 - 240 = 960 \) dollars.
6. The cost of the finale firework is $150.
7. The total amount spent is: \( 960 + 150 = 1110 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. 

First, we know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles will explode. 

1. Calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. Calculate the number of exploding candles that also smell like wet dog:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \text{ candles} \]

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and set up equations based on the given data.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
   - From the average trees: Let this be \( x \) apples

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 \)
   - Combined total: \( (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500 \)

Now, let's set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
150 + x = 500
\]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[
x = 350
\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels.
2. Let \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180.
- The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, dromedaries have 1 hump each) is 304.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is:

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \)
   - Total distance for the next 2 days: 240 km

3. **Next 1 day**: He wasn't traveling at all.
   - Total distance for this day: 0 km

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, summing up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs:**
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - He also wants to have $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he needs is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he needs by the price per card:
     \[
     \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - If he sold 100 cards, these 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection (since he keeps 1/3 and sells 2/3).
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with. Then:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3}x = 100
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150
     \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 hotdogs for the first hotdog for each guest.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (first hotdogs) + 36 (second hotdogs) = 72 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer had 72 hotdogs prepared.
   - The total hotdogs needed were 80.
   - Shortage of hotdogs = 80 - 72 = 8 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 8 guests did not get a second hotdog.

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ 98 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon and then use the information about James's performance to find out how long it took him to complete the run.

First, let's calculate Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate James's time for each segment:
- Swim: James finishes 10% faster than Jon. 
  \[ \text{Time for James's swim} = 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]
- Bike: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon.
  \[ \text{Time for James's bike} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time it took James to complete the run. According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

Therefore, it took James 59 minutes to complete the run.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

Next, we need to find the new cost per balloon after the price increase. The problem states that the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price. This can be done by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

Therefore, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil for Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.**
The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (raised bed) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all raised beds.**
Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume \( V_{\text{total}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.**
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags \( N \) needed is:
\[ N = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost.**
Each bag costs $12, so the total cost \( C \) is:

"To determine the amount of change Theo received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

1. The cost of the pen is $2.
2. The cost of the piece of paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 
   - Three times the price of the pen is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).
   - Therefore, the cost of the piece of paper is \(6 - 1 = 5\).

Next, we add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of the pen + Cost of the piece of paper
- Total cost = \(2 + 5 = 7\)

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change = Amount given - Total cost

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of pencils at each stage.

1. **Initial number of pencils:**
   - There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total initial pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils used after two months:**
   - 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.
   - Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

3. **Pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} \times \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. The percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents is:
\[ \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

The total number of kids in the class is 32. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of insects each person found with variables:
- Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
- Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
2. \( D = \frac{B}{2} \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)
3. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (Together they found 43 insects)

First, substitute \( D \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ L = \frac{B}{2} + 7 \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the third equation:
\[ \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) + \frac{B}{2} + B = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ B = 18 \]

Now, find \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Finally, find \( L \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

4. She paid half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.
5. The total amount she paid for all the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The total number of passengers on the bus now is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80

"To determine the cost of one monitor, we first need to establish the costs of the computer, the printer, and the total cost of the monitors.

1. The cost of the computer is given as $1,100.
2. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the cost of the printer is:
   \[
   1100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   1100 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   1100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400
   \]
   \[
   1800 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400
   \]
5. Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:
   \[
   2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 600
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for the cost of one monitor:
   \[
   \text{cost of one monitor} = 300

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies George originally had. If George now has 3 candies left after eating 5, we can calculate the original number of candies George had by adding the 5 candies he ate to the 3 candies he has left:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George. Therefore, we can calculate the number of candies Nick has by multiplying George's original number of candies by 2:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \]

Thus, Nick has 16 candies.

"To determine Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 \]

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.**
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \).
   - The total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   - Total savings in April = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 15x + 30x = 1125 \)
   - \( 45x = 1125 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April to meet his target.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice:**
   - The English alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it once: 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Next, Elise writes half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Writing half of the alphabet once: 13 letters.

3. **Then, Elise re-writes everything she has already written:**
   - She has already written 52 letters (from the first step) + 13 letters (from the second step) = 65 letters.
   - Re-writing everything she has already written: 65 letters.

4. **Finally, we add up all the letters she has written:**
   - Letters from the first step: 52
   - Letters from the second step: 13
   - Letters from the third step: 65
   - Total letters: \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\)

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount:

- Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
- Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
- Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12/calculator = $12.00
- Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, so we calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water conditions, and then find the difference between these times.

1. **Cold Water:**
   - Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, to swim 3 miles, Ray takes \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) minutes.

2. **Warm Water:**
   - Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.
   - Twice the time for 1 mile in cold water is \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this, Ray takes \( 32 + 2 = 34 \) minutes to swim 1 mile in warm water.
   - Therefore, to swim 3 miles, Ray takes \( 3 \times 34 = 102 \) minutes.

3. **Difference in Time:**

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, her reading rate is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \).

To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes:
\[ \text{Pages read} = 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} = 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which Ruiz and Marissa make chocolates.

1. **Ruiz's Rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's rate is \( \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

2. **Marissa's Rate:**
   - Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

3. **Total Production in 12 Hours:**
   - Ruiz's production in 12 hours: \( 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Marissa's production in 12 hours: \( 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Total Production Together:**

"To calculate Patrick's total earnings, we need to break down the sales into two periods and then sum the earnings from each period.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour were 15 cups * $0.50 per cup = $7.50 per hour.
- Over four hours, his total earnings were 4 hours * $7.50 per hour = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour were 10 cups * $0.60 per cup = $6.00 per hour.
- Over two hours, his total earnings were 2 hours * $6.00 per hour = $12.00.

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Thus, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the maximum number of rotations before they need to be replaced.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in one year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

The total number of rotations before the tire needs to be replaced is 10,440,000. To find the number of years:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. 

The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. Therefore, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per wash. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents).

The cost per wash is:
\[ \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{240 \text{ washes}} = 10 \text{ cents per wash} \]

Since each wash uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is:
\[ 10 \text{ cents} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the price of the gold jewel:**
   - The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   - Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, the price of the gold jewel is:
     \[
     \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
     \]

2. **Determine the price of the silver jewel:**
   - The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.
   - Given that the price of the gold jewel is $1600, the price of the silver jewel is:
     \[
     \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
     \]

3. **Calculate the total price for all three jewels:**
   - The total price is the sum of the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
     \]

The total price for all three jewels is:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per class over $10.

1. **Total cost of classes**: $60
2. **Total number of classes**: 10

If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny's parents will sign him up again if he attends all 10 classes.

Now, let's determine how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class if he misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate the number of customers each processes daily and then extend that to a weekly total.

1. **Daily Production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so Julie processes \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) customers per day.

2. **Weekly Production:**
   - Both work 7 days a week.
   - Jewel's weekly production: \( 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \).
   - Julie's weekly production: \( 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \).

3. **Total Weekly Production:**
   - Total weekly production for both: \( 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how far Reggie ran:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
   - Therefore, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

2. **Determine how far Lynn ran:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of miles Lynn ran.
   - According to the problem, Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn, so we can write the equation: \( 20 = L + 3 \).

3. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: \( L = 20 - 3 \).
   - Therefore, \( L = 17 \).

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it will take Bob to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot, then the total time \( T \) is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the costs of all the additional features he has chosen.

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7,500}{3} = 2,500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1,500

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500

   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( S = 15 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are: good, neutral, and good.

So, we add these to the counts:
- **Good Days**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.
- **Neutral Days**: 10 (initial) + 1 (next three days) = 11 days.
- **Bad Days**: 8 (initial) + 0 (next three days) = 8 days.

Now, we need to determine how many good days are left in the month. Since the month has 30 days and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 initial + 3 next), we need to consider only the initial 30 days for the final count.

The number of good days in the initial 30 days is 12. Since the next three days include 2 good days, the total number of good days in the month is:
- **Total Good Days in the Month**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.

However, the question asks for the number of good days left in the month after the next three days. Since the month has 30 days and we have already accounted for 33 days, we need to consider only the initial 30 days for the final count.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
- **Good Days Left in the Month**: 14 - 2 (next three days) = 12 days.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches, and then determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches.

1. Convert the initial height from feet to inches:
   - 1 foot = 12 inches
   - 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

2. Determine the total growth needed:
   - Final height = 600 inches
   - Initial height = 240 inches
   - Growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

3. Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
   - Growth rate = 30 inches per day
   - Number of days = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Thus, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 more toys to have one toy for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. Initially, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one toy for each of the 24 dogs. Now he has 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys, which is exactly the number of dogs.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \).

4. **Remaining Amount after Frances's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Remaining amount after Dylan's investment - Frances's investment.
   - Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240.

5. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment = Remaining amount after Frances's investment.
   - Skyler's investment = 240.

Thus, Skyler's investment is $240.

1. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**
   - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
   - Therefore, Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies Katarina has:**
   - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
   - Therefore, Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
   - We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies.
   - So, \( C + 7 = 68 \).
   - Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 68 - 7 = 61 \).

3. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**
   - Max has \( C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \) cookies.

4. **Determine the number of cookies Summer has:**

"To determine the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

First, we express the extension of the dress in terms of \( L \):
- The extension is 50% of \( L \), which is \( 0.5L \).

So, the length of the dress after the extension but before adding the lace trim is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Next, we add the 20 cm of lace trim to this extended length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know that this total length equals 140 cm:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we solve the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]
\[ 1.5L = 140 - 20 \]
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 

To find out how many more coins Neil saves compared to Rong:
\[ \text{Additional coins Neil saves} = 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money per hour. We know that after 3 hours, they have raised $2100. 

1. Calculate the hourly rate of fundraising:
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. Determine the total amount of money still needed to reach the goal:
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Hourly rate}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours needed to find the total hours required:

     0.80 \times 40\% = 32\%
     \]
   - This means 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

3. Calculate the percentage of the city's water use that is for non-industrial purposes.
   - Since 80% of the city's water use is for industrial purposes, the remaining 20% is for non-industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, 20% of 40% is calculated as:
     \[
     0.20 \times 40\% = 8\%
     \]
   - This means 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers + 60 small buttons = 63 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 63 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.
   - Total small buttons = 63 small buttons.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons.

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of council members is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up all the shirts:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"To determine how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Jayden has after receiving money from Ava.
2. Subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jayden has:
- Jayden initially had $70.
- Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45.

So, the total amount Jayden has is:
$70 + $45 = $115

Next, we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera:
- The camera costs $200.
- Jayden has $115.

The amount Jayden still needs is:
$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Subtracting 5 miles per hour from this gives:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to determine the distance they drove. The total time spent traveling was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance they drove is:

\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2(4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17

"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used per week.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, so the round trip distance is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (one way)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles per day} \]

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used per week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the amount of fuel used per week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons per week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.**

The price of gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of the fuel used per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons per week} \times 3 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, which includes the quarters and a portion of the twenties.

First, let's determine the total value of the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- The total value of the quarters is \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

Next, let's determine the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has 10 twenties.
- The total value of the twenties is \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties:
- The amount spent from the twenties is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = value of quarters + value of spent twenties
- Total amount spent = 35 + 120 = 155 dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of 20-minute intervals in 240 minutes: \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \)
   - Cost for Jack: \( 12 \) quarters

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each can play for 10 minutes with 1 quarter (half as long as Jack).
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 240 minutes: \( \frac{240}{10} = 24 \)
   - Cost for each worse friend: \( 24 \) quarters
   - Total cost for two worse friends: \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) quarters

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - Can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter (1.5 times as long as Jack).
   - Number of 30-minute intervals in 240 minutes: \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \)
   - Cost for the better friend: \( 8 \) quarters

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \)

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To determine how much money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add these amounts together.

1. Calculate the total cost of the goats:
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

2. Calculate the total cost of the cows:
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

3. Add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
   - Total amount spent = Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows = $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is $4500.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards each person has in terms of a variable. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards. According to the problem:

- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( x = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3x = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it will take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production with the current number of cows.

The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total milk production per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of dishes Jack has:**
   Jack has 60 dishes.

2. **Determine the number of socks Jack has:**
   Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, the number of socks Jack has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. **Determine the number of socks Peter has:**
   Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, the number of socks Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Determine the number of dishes Peter has:**
   Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, the number of dishes Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:**
   - Total number of socks:
     \[
     \text{Total number of socks} = 30 + 60 = 90
     \]
   - Total number of dishes:
     \[
     \text{Total number of dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90
     \]
   - Total number of socks and dishes:
     \[
     \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 90 + 90 = 180
     \]

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

1. We know that 5 students are good at math only.
2. We also know that 8 students perform well in English only.
3. The total number of students in the class is 20.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English:
- Total students = Students good at math only + Students good at English only + Students good at both
- 20 = 5 + 8 + Students good at both
- 20 = 13 + Students good at both
- Students good at both = 20 - 13
- Students good at both = 7

Next, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both:
- Students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both
- Students good at math = 5 + 7
- Students good at math = 12

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

The intermission is 10 minutes, so the time available for performances and transitions is:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal),
- \( t \) is the time in years (3 years).

First, calculate the annual interest rate as a decimal:
\[ r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \]

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

Next, add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts without collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Thus, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms after the sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Add the remaining goats from both farms to get the total.

First, we know that Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. 

Next, he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ goats} \]

Now, we subtract the sold goats from the initial number of goats in each farm:
- For Farm X: 
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \text{ goats} \]
- For Farm Y: 
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ goats} \]

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \text{ goats} \]

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought in a year.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, the total number of pairs he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets, taking into account the discount for the red food baskets.

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food effectively costs \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. Add the costs of the green and red food baskets to get the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of green food baskets + Cost of red food baskets
   - Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, they will build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Doubling this amount gives \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year to find the total number of homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

Therefore, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Volume of Water:**
   - The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Volume of Water After Heavy Rain:**
   - After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles.
   - Therefore, the volume of water after the heavy rain is \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons.

3. **Volume of Water on the Third Day:**
   - On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Therefore, the volume of water on the third day is \( 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \) gallons.

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, considering that each infected person infects six others every day.

- **Day 0**: 10 people are initially infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Each of the 70 people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Each of the 490 people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total tips:

\[ \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]

"To determine how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 each:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost of the chickens can be found by subtracting the profit from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Cost of the chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Thus, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for:
\[ 7000 \]"
"To determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to find out how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, the boys together sold:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, each boy sold:

18 / 2 = 9 glasses

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation to find her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract this total from her budget of $65.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost is $10.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.
   - Total cost of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

5. **Total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
   - Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

6. **Money left in budget:**
   - Kelly’s budget is $65.
   - Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Determine the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) represents the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she earned $6 in total, we can infer that \( J = 1 \) (since $6 is the total payment for all the times she mowed Joe's lawn).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \).
   - If Joe paid $6 for 1 time, and she mowed 9 times in total, the total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have 1 adult bowl.
3. Each of the two children will have 1 child bowl.

First, we convert the adult bowls to child bowls to make the calculations easier:
- 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl = 8 / 4 = 2 child bowls).

Now, calculate the total number of child bowls used for dinner:
- Calvin and his wife: 2 adults * 2 child bowls per adult = 4 child bowls.
- The two children: 2 children * 1 child bowl per child = 2 child bowls.

Total child bowls used for dinner:
- 4 child bowls (adults) + 2 child bowls (children) = 6 child bowls.

The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the number of child bowls left is:
- 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total.
   - He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - He threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - There are 20 red balloons.

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.
   - Total pieces of bologna for red balloons = \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \).

3. **Determine the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - Total pieces of bologna thrown = 58.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 40.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons = \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

4. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Total pieces of bologna for yellow balloons = \( 3y \).
   - We know \( 3y = 18 \).
   - Solving for \( y \): \( y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they received the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons
   - Number of sets of 2 balloons in 12 balloons: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
   - Total cost for 12 balloons: \( 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \) dollars
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each
   - Total cost for 2 tubs: \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) dollars

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

The total amount of money spent is $28. Since this amount was combined from both Julia's and Nadine's allowances, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and John as follows:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( A \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be John's age.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than John:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( A \) and \( P \):
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, Peter's age is:
\[

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - Total commission from 6 copies = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - Total commission from 10 copies = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy Calculation:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Initial Unoccupied Beds:**
   - Total beds = 1000
   - Occupied beds = 200
   - Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

3. **Admissions Over 2 Weeks:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - 2 weeks = 14 days.
   - Total admissions in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day × 14 days = 700 patients.

4. **Final Occupancy Calculation:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200
   - Additional occupied beds due to admissions = 700
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

5. **Final Unoccupied Beds:**
   - Total beds = 1000
   - Occupied beds after 2 weeks = 900

3. Use the information that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day. The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
2. Let \( S \) represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( W \) represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Together they have caught 339 Pokemon: \( A + S + W = 339 \)
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( A = S + 5 \)
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: \( S = 4W - 13 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( W \).

First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we have \( W = 40 \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4W - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Total distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

"To determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought.
2. Subtract the number of oranges given to her mom and sister.
3. Determine how many oranges she kept.
4. Calculate the number of oranges she sold.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges.
- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- Each box contains 20 oranges.
- Total oranges = 12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges.

Step 2: Subtract the number of oranges given to her mom and sister.
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
- Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
- Oranges given away = 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges.
- Oranges remaining = 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges.

Step 3: Determine how many oranges she kept.
- She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges.
- Oranges kept = 1/4 * 160 oranges = 40 oranges.

Step 4: Calculate the number of oranges she sold.
- Oranges sold = Oranges remaining - Oranges kept = 160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is 120.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_S = 10 \) (Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than gingerbread)
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 \) (Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday)
- \( A_U = 15 \) (Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday)

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold each day:
- \( A_S = 10 - 4 = 6 \) (boxes of apple pie on Saturday)
- \( G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \) (boxes of gingerbread on Sunday)

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 60 + 90 = 150 \) dollars

- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \) dollars

Finally, we add the total earnings from both days:
- Total earnings for two days: \( 150 + 315 = 465 \) dollars

Thus, Sunny earned a total of 465 dollars over the two days.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space each plant, including the space between plants, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the 111-foot flower bed:**
   - The total number of plants that can fit is the length of the flower bed divided by the space each plant and the space between plants occupy.
   - \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total number of ""slices"" in terms of the kids' slices. If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, then each adult's slice is equivalent to 2 kids' slices.

Given:
- 2 adults
- 4 kids
- Each adult's slice = 2 kids' slices

Total number of kids' slices equivalent:
- 2 adults * 2 kids' slices per adult = 4 kids' slices

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):

   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in 30 days:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day.
   - Over 30 days, one dwarf mines \( 36 \times 30 = 1080 \) pounds.

3. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:**
   - One dwarf mines 1080 pounds in 30 days.
   - Forty dwarves will mine \( 1080 \times 40 = 43200 \) pounds in 30 days.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is 43200 pounds.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost. 

First, let's look at the given packages:
- 2 sandwiches for $3
- 4 sandwiches for $6

We can see that the cost per sandwich is consistent across these two packages:
- For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
- For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.50. Therefore, the cost for 8 sandwiches is:
- 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two sub-scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
       - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
       - Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
     - Total probability = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Turning in Homework:**
   - Probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework = 1 - Total probability of not turning in homework
   - Probability = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 or 24%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new income.

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total loans = 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   - Jim had a $25,000 a year job before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn:**
   - Total amount = Total loans + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = 3 * $25,000/year = $75,000/year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total amount:**
   - Total amount to earn = $300,000.
   - New income per year = $75,000.

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of each piece of fabric is:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

The width of each piece of fabric is:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) × 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
80 square feet (area of one piece) × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To determine the number of laundry loads Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the weekly and then the annual loads.

1. **Weekly Loads Calculation:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets per load and 1 king set of sheets per load.
   - For the twin beds: \( \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads} \)
   - For the king size bed: \( 1 \text{ king set} = 1 \text{ load} \)
   - Total weekly loads: \( 2 \text{ loads (twin)} + 1 \text{ load (king)} = 3 \text{ loads} \)

2. **Annual Loads Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total annual loads: \( 3 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 156 \text{ loads} \)

Therefore, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year.

"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of movies they watch each weekend.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday compared to Saturday.
   - Therefore, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies on Sunday.

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies per weekend = Movies on Saturday + Movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6 movies

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = Total movies per weekend × Number of weekends
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = 6 × 4 = 24 movies

Thus, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:
   - The cats are fed twice a day.
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total food available = 720 grams.
   - Total food consumed per day = 360 grams/day.
   - Number of days = 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza had 8 slices.
   - There were 4 pizzas.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total slices eaten (31) is less than the total slices available (32), the calculation is consistent.

The total number of slices they ate is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to sum up the costs for each service provided:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The doctor charges $300 per hour. Therefore, the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours} \times 300 \text{ dollars/hour} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: Hannah receives 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4. Therefore, the cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pills} \times 4 \text{ dollars/pill} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The mandatory minimum parking time is 2 hours, and the parking rate is $6 per hour. Therefore, the cost for parking is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ dollars/hour} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
200 \text{ dollars} + 150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:

"To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of emails he responds to each day.

1. James receives 80 emails a day.
2. 20% of these emails do not require a response. Therefore, the number of emails that do not require a response is:
   \[
   80 \times 0.20 = 16 \text{ emails}
   \]
3. The number of emails that require a response each day is:
   \[
   80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails}
   \]
4. To find the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then sum these costs.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**

   \[
   \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost of mailing all the coupons is the sum of the costs for the small and big coupons:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets.
2. Let \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets.

According to the problem:
- The total amount of fence is 100 feet.
- Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can write these as:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate is half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. This means that the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

Thus, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse blinks. The lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can find the rate of blinking per minute by dividing the total number of blinks by the total time in minutes:

\[ \text{Rate of blinking} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks we want by the rate of blinking:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to complete their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent on their respective tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, we sum the times for all three individuals:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance John drives to visit his parents.
2. Determine the total distance for a round trip.
3. Calculate the total distance driven in a month, considering he visits his parents twice a month.

Step 1: Calculate the one-way distance.
- John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive to his parents' house.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- One-way distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

Step 2: Determine the total distance for a round trip.
- A round trip includes the distance to his parents' house and back.
- Round trip distance = One-way distance × 2
- Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance driven in a month.
- John visits his parents twice a month.
- Total monthly distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits per month
- Total monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is 560 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times (\text{miles Brian walks in 7 days}) \]

To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we solve for the miles Brian walks:

\[ \text{miles Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.
2. Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.
3. Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.
4. Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.**

- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Total toys produced by the first 4 workers:
  \[
  120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
  \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.**

- The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys:
  \[
  400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in the 10-hour shift is 380 toys.

**Step 3: Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.**

- Total toys produced by the fifth worker:
  \[
  380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.**

- The fifth worker produced 180 toys in 10 hours:
  \[
  \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
  \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is 105 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

So, Grandma's speed on the beach is 1 mile per 20 minutes.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using her speed on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. Therefore, the amount she has saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can determine the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the current number of marbles:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles from the 36 he currently has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
- Each pack costs $10.00.
- Russell orders 4 packs.
- Total cost without discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

Step 2: Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
- Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.
- Total cost after discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Step 3: Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.
- Each pack contains 9 bagels.
- Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.
- Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.

Therefore, the cost per bagel after the discount is $1.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed for a certain number of scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
   - \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

   So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 parts (5 parts men + 9 parts women), there are 84 passengers in total.

First, we calculate the value of one part:
\[ \text{Total parts} = 5 + 9 = 14 \]
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Next, we calculate the number of men and women:
\[ \text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ \text{Number of women remaining} = 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Thus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

1. **Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
   - Number of individual sunflowers sold per day = \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of individual sunflowers + Number of sunflowers in bouquets
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold over 3 days = \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \).

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291.

"Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as \( R \), \( B \), and \( Y \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, substitute \( B = 5 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

  \]

Since the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple:
- The amount of paint for each of these colors is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
  \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the special size box and then find the cost per pod.

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. Calculate how many pods you can get for $1:
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 is 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 to $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
\[
240

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is:

   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining length of the chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the length of chalk used each subsequent day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - The length of chalk used each day is \( 0.20 \times \text{remaining length} \).

3. **Calculate the remaining length of the chalk each day until it is less than 2 inches:**

   - **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
     - Remaining length: \( 2.75 \) inches.
     - Chalk used: \( 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \) inches.
     - Remaining length: \( 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \) inches.

   - **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
     - Remaining length: \( 2.20 \) inches.
     - Chalk used: \( 2.20 \times 0.20 = 0.44 \) inches.
     - Remaining length: \( 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \) inches.

4. **Determine the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - After Tuesday, the remaining length is 2.20 inches.
   - After Wednesday, the remaining length is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days before it needs to be recycled.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to account for both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs**: Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour.
2. **Rate of melting snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

Therefore, the net rate of snowball accumulation per hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

We need to find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Using the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour, we can set up the equation:
\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backwards.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

4. **End of the Third Day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Now, let's determine the initial number of bandages they started with. We know they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + \text{Total ordered} - \text{Total used} = 78 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 150 - 91 = 78 \]

Solving for the initial bandages:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 59 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 59 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 19 \]

Thus, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation to represent the total length:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

2. **Second Day**: 20 more people than the first day, so:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
   \]
3. **Third Day**: Twice the number of people as the second day, so:
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of people for the remaining four days of the week. Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for these four days. Therefore, the total number of people for these four days is:
\[
4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ people}
\]

Now, we sum up the number of people Conor saw each day over the entire week:
\[
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500
\]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

"To determine the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then sum them up.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop:
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ kernels}
   \]
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop:
   \[
   4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ kernels}
   \]
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ kernels}
   \]
5. After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop:
   \[
   \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ kernels}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the kernels that popped:
\[
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210
\]

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"To determine the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus rides separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Cost of the hotel:**
   - Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
     \[
     3 \text{ nights} \times \$80 \text{ per night} = \$240
     \]

2. **Cost of the bus rides:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The price of one night at the hotel is $80, so 10% of $80 is:

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of making one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. We will then subtract this total cost from the total revenue from selling 10 jars.

1. **Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:**
   - Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * 6 = $12
   - Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * 8 = $12
   - Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * 10 = $20

   Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Selling price per jar = $50
   - Total revenue for 10 jars = 10 * $50 = $500

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60.

"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total value of quarters = 32 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $8.00

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = 95 dimes * $0.10/dime = $9.50

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = 120 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $6.00

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = 750 pennies * $0.01/penny = $7.50

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
- Total dollar amount = $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

"To determine how much money Matthew would earn from selling his toy soldiers, we need to calculate the total earnings from each half of his collection and then sum these amounts.

1. Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers.
2. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we calculate the number of toys in each half:
- Half of 12 toys is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toys.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each half:
- For the first half (6 toys at $5 each):
  \[
  6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- For the second half (6 toys at $7 each):
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days it takes to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes to be filled = 84 holes.
   - Net holes filled per day = 3 holes.
   - Number of days to fill all holes = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - 1 week = 7 days.
   - Number of weeks = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School. Therefore, the average enrollment at Butler High School is:

\[
4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \text{ students}
\]

Next, we find the difference in enrollment between the two schools:

\[
4000 - 3000 = 1000 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

   - Therefore, Igor gathered \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.

2. **Beakers:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor gathered the correct number of beakers but lost some.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost.
   - Therefore, Igor placed \( 7 - x \) beakers on the lab bench.

3. **Petri Dishes:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
   - Therefore, Igor gathered \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

4. **Total Items:**
   - The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29.
   - Therefore, the equation for the total number of items is:
     \[
     8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   31 - x = 29

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron did. Therefore, Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Vanessa takes \( t \) minutes to run one mile, Aaron takes \( \frac{t}{2} \) minutes to run one mile.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can set up the equation for Aaron's time:
\[ \text{Time for Aaron} = 2 \times \frac{t}{2} = t \]
Since Aaron's total time is 16 minutes:
\[ t = 16 \]

Now, we know that Vanessa takes \( t \) minutes to run one mile. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, her total time is:
\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = 4 \times t = 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
