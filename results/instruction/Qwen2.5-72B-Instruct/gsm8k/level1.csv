"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair costs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. 

\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house and the repairs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh's profit is:

70,000"

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Total feed needed = 3 cups/chicken/day * 20 chickens = 60 cups/day.

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   Morning feed = 15 cups
   Afternoon feed = 25 cups
   Total feed given = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed - Total feed given
   Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass:
- Cost of one full-price glass: $5
- Cost of one discounted glass: $3

The total cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]

"Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the different stages of the download process and the interruption.

1. **Initial Download Phase:**
   - Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of the 200 GB file is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - The time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarted Download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The total file size is 200 GB.
   - The time to download 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the initial download time, the restart time, and the restarted download time.
   - Total time = 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (restarted download) = 160 minutes.

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John travels away from home and then subtract the distance he travels back towards home.

1. **Distance traveled away from home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Distance traveled back towards home:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours have already passed), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total distance traveled back towards home:**
   - Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Final distance from home:**
   - Distance from home = Distance traveled away - Distance traveled back
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay**: Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Pay**: Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings**: Sum of regular pay and overtime pay.
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3
4. **Net Annual Profit**: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90.

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \) vacuum cleaners in total so far.
3. After these sales, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( x - \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).
5. After the orange house sale, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so the equation is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = 5
   \]
6. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:
\[ 15 \text{ liters} \]

"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we know Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:
\[ \text{Raymond's age} = \text{Samantha's age} + 6 = 31 + 6 = 37 \]

Next, we know Raymond had his son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago this was, we subtract the age at which Raymond had his son from his current age:
\[ \text{Years ago Raymond's son was born} = \text{Raymond's current age} - \text{Age when son was born} = 37 - 23 = 14 \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount. Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. A 25% discount means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and then subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Adding these together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings consumed in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \) dollars. The two pairs of high heels together cost \( B - 5 \) dollars. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

We know that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is also \( B - 5 \):
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

The boots cost 104 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age by \( D \) and Allen's age by \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We also know that the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, solve for \( A \):
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[ 109 \]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the mean.

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average} = 80 \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

1. First, determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels:
   \[
   \text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

2. Next, determine how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron:
   \[
   \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts consumed in 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, so over 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine the cost per yogurt.
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts.
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time spent running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know the total distance John runs each week is 60 miles.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed and use it to find her running speed:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Since skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed.
   - Let \( w \) be her walking speed. Then \( 6 = 4w \).
   - Solving for \( w \), we get \( w = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance running: \( 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \).
   - Distance walking: \( 1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = \( 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine the number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.**

- The bag has 5 servings.
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

**Step 2: Determine the number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target.**

- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Remaining calories you can consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

**Step 3: Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.**

- Each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g, so each serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60g.
- To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we use the ratio of calories to grams in a serving:
  - 250 calories = 60g
  - 1 calorie = 60g / 250 calories = 0.24g
  - 200 calories = 200 * 0.24g = 48g

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\) classes.

Next, calculate the total number of students:
- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\) students.

Finally, calculate the total amount of money Judy makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total amount is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in one week.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16, we can work our way down to the bottom level.

1. The 4th level has a square footage of 16.
2. The 3rd level, being twice the 4th level, has a square footage of \(16 \times 2 = 32\).
3. The 2nd level, being twice the 3rd level, has a square footage of \(32 \times 2 = 64\).
4. The 1st level, being twice the 2nd level, has a square footage of \(64 \times 2 = 128\).

Now, we sum the square footages of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

\[
\text{Total square footage} = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240

"First, let's determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's determine how much water the two girls got in total. Each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters, so:

\[ \text{Water each girl got} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls:

\[ \text{Total water the girls got} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

\[ \text{Total water taken} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Sylvie's monthly salary after 5 years of service.
2. Calculate her monthly salary after 8 years of service.
3. Convert the monthly salary to an annual salary.

**Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's monthly salary after 5 years of service.**

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate her monthly salary after 8 years of service.**

Since the salary increase policy applies only once after 5 years, her monthly salary remains $660 for the next 3 years.

**Step 3: Convert the monthly salary to an annual salary.**

\[ \text{Annual salary} = 660 \times 12 = 7920 \]

Thus, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that both the adult and child dinosaurs will consume.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.

\[ 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.

\[ 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad for the adults and the children to find the total amount needed:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left in the line is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let \(x\) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time based on the rate at which the fog bank moves.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the fog bank is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

The city is 42 miles across. To find the total time it takes to cover 42 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times 3.3333 \]
\[ \text{Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and then solve for Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) (30-minute episodes)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. According to the problem, after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of each type of board after the 50% price increase:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:
- Revenue from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$270 - \$180 = \$90

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water and the ratio between them.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We can set up the following proportion to find out how many parts of the total 120 correspond to the sugar:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Here, \( x \) represents the number of teaspoons of sugar. To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve the equation:

\[
7 \times 120 = 20 \times x
\]

\[
840 = 20x
\]

\[
x = \frac{840}{20}
\]

\[
x = 42

"To solve this problem, we first determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port from the first day. There were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, we can set up the equation to find Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Lylah's salary increased. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we assume Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's salary did from four years ago to now. Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so we apply the same percentage increase to Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she slept:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Therefore, for Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she slept:
   \[
   6 + 6 = 12 \text{ hours}

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

The number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars).

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
( Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars ) * 100

So, the percentage is:
( 4 / 20 ) * 100 = 20%

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Thus, the number of worker bees is:

"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much he would earn if he worked those hours instead.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, if he worked the 14 hours he usually spends playing video games, he would earn:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares.

First, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Next, each hectare produces 100 pineapples per harvest. Therefore, each hectare produces 100 pineapples * 4 harvests = 400 pineapples per year.

John has 10 hectares, so the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is 400 pineapples per hectare * 10 hectares = 4000 pineapples.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 that many bees return. So, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. The bees that left before and hadn't returned are:
   \[
   30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \text{ bees}
   \]

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 75.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference in their travel times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their travel times is:

\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

"To determine how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating the tires of the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came by, so that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so \(10 \times 0.25 = 2.50\) dollars.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came by, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so \(9 \times 0.25 = 2.25\) dollars.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came by, so that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so \(1 \times 0.25 = 0.25\) dollars.

Now, we add up the total earnings:
\[ 2.50 + 2.25 + 0.25 = 5.00 \]

So, Shawnda made 5.00 dollars that day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. **Dave ate 14 fries.**
2. **The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:** \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:** \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. **Let \( x \) be the number of fries left after the pigeons ate.**
5. **The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:** \( \frac{2}{3}x \) fries.
6. **After the raccoon, \( \frac{1}{3}x \) fries were left.**
7. **Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind:** \( \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x = 18
\]

So, there were 18 fries left after the pigeons ate. Now, let's find out how many fries were there initially:

- **Fries left after the seagull ate:** \( 18 + 9 = 27 \)
- **Fries left after Dave ate:** \( 27 + 7 = 34 \)
- **Initial number of fries:** \( 34 + 14 = 48 \)

Thus, the initial number of fries in the pack was:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each day:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
- He spends 3 hours on each of the 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- He spends 4 hours on each of the 2 days (Tuesday, Thursday), so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week is:
\[ 9 + 8 = 17 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of hours Kimo spends in class over the 16 weeks of the semester:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, in this case, feet. 

1. **Convert the length of each type of baked good to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long, so each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
   - Each baguette is already given as 2 feet long.

2. **Calculate the total length for each type of baked good:**
   - Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
   - Total length of croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
   - Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

3. **Sum the total lengths:**
   - Total length = 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost.
4. Calculate the cost of lemons based on the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. They made a profit of $25. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25 \]

Next, we need to find the total cost. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = 3 \text{ (lemons)} + 2 \text{ (sugar)} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made. The total cost is:
\[ C = 5G \]

The total revenue is the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total number of glasses is:
\[ \text{Total glasses} = 20G \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \]

Now we can set up the equation for profit:
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 5G \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 (Chinese)

Next, we know that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

160 (Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount after the donation.
6. The final amount will be the remaining money after all these expenses and donations.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount after Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount after Donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount after Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Subtract Amounts Given to Daughter and Wife:**
   \[
   \text{Final Remaining Amount} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies.

Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations. According to the problem:
\[ 5C = 200 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Next, we need to find out how many red roses she ordered. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let \( R \) represent the number of red roses. Therefore:
\[ R = 4C \]

Substituting the value of \( C \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Sandra ordered 160 red roses. Since Fred has not delivered any of these red roses yet, he must deliver all 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, let's determine Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \text{Jan's age two years ago} = 30 - 2 = 28 \]

Next, we use the information that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
\[ \text{Mark's age two years ago} = \frac{28}{2} + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 \]

Now, we find Mark's current age:
\[ \text{Mark's current age} = 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Since Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ \text{Jean's current age} = 21 + 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first event is 2 times more likely than the second event.
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     2 \times 100 = 200\%
     \]

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, since the interest is applied monthly. The formula is:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the interest is applied.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

1. **Weight of Chocolate Bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 bars * 40g/bar = 1000g.

2. **Weight of Candied Apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of candied apples = 80 apples * 20g/apple = 1600g.

3. **Total Weight of the Bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of chocolate bars + weight of candied apples
   - Total weight = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates = 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white chickens than red chickens. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, since he walks around the edge. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time \(t\) he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ t = \frac{distance}{speed} \]

Substitute the perimeter for distance and 3 miles/hour for speed:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers + 50 more = 150 customers.
3. Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \).
4. The total number of customers over the three days is given as 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

From the problem, we know:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.
3. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

First, let's express the amounts of water in the pools 4 minutes ago:
- 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the first condition:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

According to the second condition:
\[ B = 4S \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Set the two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]

Solve for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months, paying $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount due:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:

   - Total minutes for boss calls: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Extra calls:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total minutes used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for boss calls + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Minutes remaining:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes remaining = Monthly allowance - Total minutes used
   - Minutes remaining = \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin:
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   So, after Billy takes his fries:
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]
   So, after Colby takes his fries:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2f) \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Solving for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
- The total weight of the tree is \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate:
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \).

Finally, subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies:
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the amount needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Add the amounts of flour needed for both days:

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time required for each type of hole and then sum these times.

1. Time to dig 30 small holes:
   - Each small hole takes 3 minutes.
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 holes * 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes.

2. Time to dig 15 large holes:
   - Each large hole takes 10 minutes.
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 holes * 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes.

3. Total time for all holes:
   - Total time = Time for small holes + Time for large holes
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the current sum of their ages, which is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, the total increase in their combined age will be \(10 + 10 = 20\) years.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice as many as a mamba, we can set up the equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = Remaining length / Length of one bead = 17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

So, in the second week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories

Adding these totals together:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has before buying the can of pop.

- Kelly has 5 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Kelly also has 2 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.

Adding these amounts together, Kelly has \(125 + 20 = 145\) cents.

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has.

- The can of pop costs 55 cents.

So, the amount of money Kelly will have left is \(145 - 55 = 90\) cents.

"To find the number of 5-star rows, we first calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star rows and 6-star rows, and then subtract this from the total number of stars to find how many are in the 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each 5-star row contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Thus, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first calculate the daily egg consumption and then extend that to a week.

1. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each day: \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\)
   - Two people eat 2 eggs each day: \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\)
   - Total daily consumption: \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\)

2. **Weekly Consumption:**
   - Since the family eats eggs every day, the weekly consumption is: \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \).

The equation for the total number of pencils Jam has is:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.
   - Salary of each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers \(\times\) Salary of each junior programmer.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers \(\times\) Salary of each senior programmer.
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = 60 \(\times\) $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers:**
   - Total payroll for all programmers = Total payroll for junior programmers + Total payroll for senior programmers.
   - Total payroll for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cows and \( h \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can express these as:
\[ c + h = 60 \]
\[ h = 2c \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( c \):
\[ c + 2c = 60 \]
\[ 3c = 60 \]
\[ c = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ h = 2c = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times c) + (2 \times h) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have is:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa receives in 5 days.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days.
3. Subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount received to find the total amount saved.

Step 1: Total amount received in 5 days
Marisa receives $5 each day. Over 5 days, she receives:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ dollars/day} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Total amount spent on lollipops in 5 days
Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day. The cost per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 1 \text{ dollar/day} \]
Over 5 days, the total cost is:

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
3. Calculate the total profit by subtracting the cost of supplies from the total revenue.
4. Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.
5. Calculate the profit per hour.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade.**
Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups.
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.**
Each cup is sold for $1.
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar per cup} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total profit.**
The cost of supplies is $18.
\[ 36 \text{ dollars (revenue)} - 18 \text{ dollars (cost)} = 18 \text{ dollars (profit)} \]

**Step 4: Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.**
Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit per hour.**
\[ \frac{18 \text{ dollars (profit)}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Thus, Millie's profit per hour is:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, then he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land he had initially. The equation to represent the situation is:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

On the day of the performance, only the girls are performing. However, half of these girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls performing = 26 / 2 = 13

Additionally, the 3 teachers decide to join the performance. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

2. Convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
   - 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatts = 7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day.

3. Calculate the reduced daily energy consumption:
   - If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.
   - Reduced daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - Reduced daily energy consumption in kilowatts = 2700 watts/day / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

   \]

2. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson needs:
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
   \]
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
   \]

3. The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds:
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}

4. Sum the payments for both months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month for simplicity)

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees who continued working in June:
\[ 40 \, \text{employees} \times \frac{3}{4} = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

Total payment for one employee in June:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as:
\[ C + D = 180 \]
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   \[
   200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   \[
   30\% \times 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Next 1 day**: He didn't travel at all.
   \[
   0 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   \[
   300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
   \]

Now, sum all the distances:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[
3140 \text{ km}

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we first need to determine the size of Zack's locker using the information about Peter's locker. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, to find the size of Timothy's locker, we multiply Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Thus, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we calculate the difference between the comb's elevation and Oliver's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over after buying the ticket. Therefore, he must have made $150 from selling his cards.
2. Each card is sold for $1.5.
3. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he made by the price per card:
   \[
   \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100
   \]
4. Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards.
5. If 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection, we can find the total number of cards by setting up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total number of cards} = 100
   \]
6. Solving for the total number of cards:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would only have one hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for one hotdog) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26 / 2 = 13 guests.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order cost after the 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

1. The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
2. The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
3. The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay. Each bail costs $3.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs:
- Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional loose eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is:
\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs:
\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. Therefore, the number of trays she can put out is:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays.

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

1. The cost of the movie ticket is $12.
2. The cost of the soda is $3.
3. The total cost without the super ticket is the sum of the movie ticket, the soda, and the popcorn: $12 + $3 + P, where P is the price of the popcorn.
4. The cost of the super ticket is $20, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, making the total cost $21.
5. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost without the super ticket is $21 - $2 = $19.

Now, we can set up the equation:
\[ 12 + 3 + P = 19 \]

Solving for P:
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon before the increase can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost for 20 balloons}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

Next, we need to find the new cost per balloon after the price increase. The problem states that the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price. This can be done by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

Thus, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for all the raised beds.

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed:
   - The dimensions of one raised bed are 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall.
   - Volume of one raised bed = width × length × height = 2 ft × 8 ft × 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

2. Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds:
   - Total volume = volume of one raised bed × number of raised beds = 32 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed:
   - Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
   - Number of bags needed = total volume / volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - There are 15 red cards.
   - Green cards are 60% more than the red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - Yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards.
   - The sum of red and green cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 39.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Total number of cards = number of red cards + number of green cards + number of yellow cards.
   - Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

The total number of cards is 78.

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight of all feed = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since the farmer can't make a partial trip).

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we first need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

2. Calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

3. Calculate the total weekly earnings:
   - Total weekly earnings = Earnings from aluminum cans + Earnings from plastic bottles
   - Total weekly earnings = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

4. Calculate the monthly earnings:
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly earnings = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks
   - Monthly earnings = 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow the information step by step.

First, determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we calculate Toni's plants as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Becky and Kelly, taking into account the discounts they received, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 45 \) cents.
- This equals \( 900 \) cents or \( 9 \) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount.
- Therefore, the total cost for Becky is \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 50 \) cents.
- This equals \( 1000 \) cents or \( 10 \) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount.
- The discount amount is \( 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \) dollar.
- Therefore, the total cost for Kelly is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) dollars.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = \( \frac{3}{4} \times \) Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \) grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 grains + 48 grains

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( n \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25n \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( n \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, solve for \( n \):

\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (Total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( D = 9 \) back into the equations to find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

This means they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn together. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364 to find the total yards used:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To maximize the number of sticks, Frederick should buy the type of wood that provides the most sticks per dollar.
   - Calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood:
     - For 2 x 4: \( \frac{200 \text{ sticks}}{4 \text{ dollars}} = 50 \text{ sticks per dollar} \)
     - For 2 x 8: \( \frac{400 \text{ sticks}}{6 \text{ dollars}} \approx 66.67 \text{ sticks per dollar} \)

   - Since 2 x 8 provides more sticks per dollar, it is the more cost-effective option.

4. **Determine the Maximum Number of 2 x 8 Pieces He Can Buy:**
   - Each 2 x 8 piece costs $6.
   - With $24, Frederick can buy \( \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{6 \text{ dollars per piece}} = 4 \) pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Sticks:**
   - Each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks.
   - Therefore, 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood will provide \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

- Ali has six $20 bills, which total to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of 160 dollars is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars.

So, after giving his sister 80 dollars, Ali has \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars left.

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 80 dollars to buy dinner:

- \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 80 dollars is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

So, after buying dinner, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and 1 hour is 60 minutes, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long Royce takes. According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first double Rob's time: \(120 \times 2 = 240\) minutes. Then, we add the additional 40 minutes: \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle the house.

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we first calculate the number of skeins required for one set of winter wear (one hat, one scarf, one sweater, one pair of mittens, and one pair of socks):

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Adding these together gives the total number of skeins needed for one grandchild:
\[ 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 \text{ skeins} \]

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one grandchild by 3:
\[ 21 \times 3 = 63 \text{ skeins} \]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
   - Kathy's rate = 2 * 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.

5. **Total picking rate:**
   - Total rate = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate
   - Total rate = 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour
   - Total rate = 29 quarts/hour

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate the total cost of electricity for both scenarios and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the weekly cost before adding the new device:**
   - Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
   - Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
   - Daily cost: \( 12 \text{ kW/h} \times 1.50 \text{ $/kW/h} = 18 \text{ $/day} \)
   - Weekly cost: \( 18 \text{ $/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 126 \text{ $/week} \)

2. **Calculate the weekly cost after adding the new device:**
   - New daily consumption: \( 12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h} \)
   - Daily cost: \( 14 \text{ kW/h} \times 1.50 \text{ $/kW/h} = 21 \text{ $/day} \)
   - Weekly cost: \( 21 \text{ $/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ $/week} \)

3. **Calculate the difference in weekly costs:**
   - Difference: \( 147 \text{ $/week} - 126 \text{ $/week} = 21 \text{ $/week} \)

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \( 21 \).

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Next, we convert the days into hours. Assuming a standard workday of 8 hours, 10 days is equivalent to:
\[ 10 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 80 \text{ hours} \]

This means one person takes 80 hours to paint a whole house. If 5 people are working together, the time required to paint the house is divided by 5:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ people}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 16 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \). According to the problem, Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can write:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out the cost of the headphone set. 

The total amount Tom paid is $48, and the cost of one CD is $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Thus, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can break down the information given:

1. Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for most of the weeks.
2. There were two consecutive weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. There was one week where he worked out for 6 hours.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, which totals 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.
- The total hours for these 5 weeks is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

Next, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 5 hours:
- He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks.
- The total hours for these 2 weeks is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

Finally, calculate the total hours for the week he worked out 6 hours:
- He worked out 6 hours for 1 week.
- The total hours for this week is \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Now, add all these totals together to get the total number of hours worked out over the 8 weeks:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**

"To find the cost of one monitor, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors:
- Total cost of all items: $2,400
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700

The combined cost of the 2 monitors is:
$2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
$600 / 2 = $300

Thus, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To find out how old Anne is, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 years + 2 years
Anne's age = 8 years

   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the savings for each half:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   Since he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, he will save \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly target:**

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles required for the 70 guests, with each guest needing 2 bottles:
\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles needed to find out how many more bottles he needs to buy:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \]

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, when the water is warm, the time it takes to swim a mile is:
\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

- Cold water: \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \)
- Warm water: \( 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know there are 7 buttons with two holes each. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is:
\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 \text{ buttons} - 7 \text{ buttons} = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

Each of these 14 buttons has four holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is:
\[ 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

Finally, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we first need to determine how many goals Mark and Anna scored based on the information given.

Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, the problem states that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage error can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

"To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we first need to determine the third measurement. Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM, and it increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his speed by another 5 WPM, his new speed will be:

52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we have the three measurements:
1. 47 WPM
2. 52 WPM
3. 57 WPM

To find the average, we sum these measurements and divide by the number of measurements:

Average = (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3

Average = 156 WPM / 3

Average = 52 WPM

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts every day for breakfast, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option and then find the difference between these totals.

1. Weight loss from eating Cheerios:
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \( 1.25 \times 5 = 6.25 \) pounds.

2. Weight gain from eating donuts:
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \( 1.75 \times 5 = 8.75 \) pounds.

3. Difference in weight change:
   - The difference between the weight gain and the weight loss is \( 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 \) pounds.

Thus, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the number of people attending from each group of invitations.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people will bring 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from the email invitations is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Total from Email Invitations:**
   - The total number of people from the email invitations is \(100 + 200 = 300\).

3. **Phone Calls:**
   - Alex calls 10 friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from the phone calls is \(8 \times 1 = 8\).

4. **Total from Phone Calls:**
   - The total number of people from the phone calls is \(10 + 8 = 18\).

5. **Total Number of Seats Needed:**
   - Adding the totals from the email invitations and the phone calls gives \(300 + 18 = 318\).

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per day.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

Next, to find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

The smallest angle is 30 degrees. The largest angle, which is three times the smallest angle, is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, in one hour, Ruiz can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together gives the total amount of chocolates made by both in 12 hours:

\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- The total number of cups sold in four hours is \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the first four hours is \( 60 \text{ cups} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, we calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- The total number of cups sold in two hours is \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \).
- The total earnings for the next two hours is \( 20 \text{ cups} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.
3. Calculate how many months the tires will last.
4. Convert the number of months into years.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 3: Calculate how many months the tires will last.**

To find out how many months the tires will last:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

**Step 4: Convert the number of months into years.**

Since there are 12 months in a year:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to find out how many washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, we can calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle:

120 washes * 2 pumps/wash = 240 pumps

Now, we know the bottle costs $24.00 and contains 240 pumps. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

"First, let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, adding 2 more pieces to the total:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces} + 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Starting with a 20-pack, after chewing 6 pieces, he has:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} - 6 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

He then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:
\[ \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, at the end of the day, Jim has:
\[ 14 \text{ pieces} - 7 \text{ pieces} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we first calculate the total amount each coach spent.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]
So, the baseball coach spent $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]
So, the basketball coach spent $112.

Next, we find the difference between the amounts spent by the basketball coach and the baseball coach:
\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. So, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600 to get the speed in kb per hour:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \]

Next, we convert kb per hour to Mb per hour. Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:
\[ 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \div 1000 = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and then the number of cars towed in the remaining four days of the week.

For the first three days:
- The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day.
- Therefore, for three days, the total number of cars towed is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) cars.

For the remaining four days:
- The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day compared to the first three days.
- So, each of these days, the tow truck pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars.
- Therefore, for four days, the total number of cars towed is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cars.

Adding the totals from both parts of the week:
- Total cars towed = \(30 + 24 = 54\) cars.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 48 inches.

Adam's current height is 40 inches, and he needs to be 48 inches tall to ride the roller coaster. The difference in height is:

48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the height difference by his annual growth rate:

8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years

Thus, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.**
James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
\[ \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to acquire the cars.**
The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost to Acquire Each Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost to Acquire 10 Cars} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Sales} - \text{Total Cost to Acquire} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**
James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{James's Commission} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made:
\[ 17,500 \]"

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each jewel and then sum them up.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewel:**
   Given: $2000

2. **Price of a Gold Jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed: 70 mph
Bob's speed: 55 mph

The relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is the difference in their speeds:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to close a 75-mile gap, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we first need to determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now, knowing that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first calculate the maximum total cost his parents are willing to pay per class. Since they will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, the total cost for 10 classes should not exceed $100 (10 classes * $10/class).

However, Manny's classes cost $60 in total. To find out how many classes he can miss, we need to determine the number of classes that would make the cost per attended class exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny attends. The cost per class is then \( \frac{60}{x} \). We set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{60}{x} \leq 10
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
60 \leq 10x
\]

\[
x \geq 6
\]

This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at or below $10. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he can miss is:

\[
10 - 6 = 4
\]

Thus, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:

\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ customers per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:

\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers per day} \]

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is:

\[ 150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers per week} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how far Reggie ran:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
   - Therefore, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

2. **Determine how far Lynn ran:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of miles Lynn ran.
   - According to the problem, \( 20 = L + 3 \).

3. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: \( L = 20 - 3 \).
   - Therefore, \( L = 17 \).

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of one apple is:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of one orange is:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 + 5 \times 1.10 = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = V \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is 216 seconds.

"To calculate Tim's new annual salary after the promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the bonus, which is half of his new monthly salary.
3. Calculate the total annual salary, which is the sum of the new monthly salary for 12 months and the bonus.

Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Old Monthly Salary} + (\text{Old Monthly Salary} \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + (20000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + 1000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = 21000 \]

Step 2: Calculate the bonus.
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{21000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = 10500 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total annual salary.
\[ \text{Total Annual Salary} = (\text{New Monthly Salary} \times 12) + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Annual Salary} = (21000 \times 12) + 10500 \]
\[ \text{Total Annual Salary} = 252000 + 10500 \]
\[ \text{Total Annual Salary} = 262500 \]

   - Total cost for suits = 10 * $750 = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 * $150 = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 * $60 = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total sales from green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times \text{Sales from red hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = \text{Sales from red hats} + \text{Sales from green hats} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales for the second month are:

\[ \text{Total sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total sales for the first month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from both months:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
\[30 + 50 + 40 = 120\]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- 1/2 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Kassidy has:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as much money as Aurelia.
   - Therefore, Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \) dollars.

2. **Determine how much money Rayna has:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - Therefore, Rayna has \( 90 + 60 = 150 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money they have together:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has $90.
   - Rayna has $150.
   - Total money = \( 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \) dollars.

4. **Determine how much each person would have if they shared the total amount equally:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, we add these to the counts:
- **Good Days**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.
- **Neutral Days**: 10 (initial) + 1 (next three days) = 11 days.
- **Bad Days**: 8 (initial) + 0 (next three days) = 8 days.

Now, we need to determine how many good days are left in the month. Since the month has 30 days and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 initial + 3 next days), we need to consider only the first 30 days for the final count.

Thus, the number of good days in the first 30 days is 12.

However, since the next three days include 2 good days, we need to adjust the count for the remaining days in the month:
- **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.

Since the month has 30 days, and we have already accounted for 30 days, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches, and then determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches.

1. Convert the initial height from feet to inches:
   - 1 foot = 12 inches
   - 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

2. Determine the total growth needed:
   - Final height = 600 inches
   - Initial height = 240 inches
   - Growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

3. Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
   - Growth rate = 30 inches per day
   - Number of days = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 more toys to have one toy for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, there are 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one for each dog, so he now has 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

"Let's denote the number of cookies each person has as follows:
- Katarina: \( K \)
- Max: \( M \)
- Cookie Monster: \( C \)
- Summer: \( S \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \)
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \)
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \)
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \)

First, we substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation:
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we substitute \( M = 73 \) into the second equation:
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Then, we substitute \( M = 73 \) into the third equation:
\[ S = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we have the number of cookies each person has:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) cm. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

First, we express the extension of the dress in terms of \( L \):
- The extension is 50% of \( L \), which is \( 0.5L \).

So, the length of the dress after the extension is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Next, we add the 20 cm of lace trim to this extended length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: The problem states there are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter in square feet is the same as the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is:
\[

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs required for the function and then compare it to the number of chairs the restaurant currently has.

1. Calculate the total number of chairs needed:
   - There are 42 adults, so 42 regular chairs are needed.
   - There are 15 babies, so 15 high chairs are needed.

2. Calculate the total number of chairs the restaurant currently has:
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so it has \(5 \times 8 = 40\) regular chairs.

3. Determine the total number of chairs currently available:
   - Total chairs available = 40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 chairs.

4. Determine the total number of chairs needed:
   - Total chairs needed = 42 regular chairs + 15 high chairs = 57 chairs.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, making the total number of people:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat, and each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Therefore, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ seats} \times 2 \text{ drinks/seat} = 40 \text{ drinks} \]
\[ 20 \text{ seats} \times 3 \text{ snacks/seat} = 60 \text{ snacks} \]

The total number of drinks and snacks combined is:

\[ 40 \text{ drinks} + 60 \text{ snacks} = 100 \text{ items} \]

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each female ate 3 dumplings and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males. There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how much candy each person has eaten after two weeks (14 days).

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

Next, we calculate how much candy each has left after 14 days.

Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday.
2. Determine the number of people who had not voted by midday.
3. Calculate the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.
4. Determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday.**

By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 5000 people had voted:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of people who had not voted by midday.**

The number of people who had not voted by midday is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.**

By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining 3000 people had voted:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.**

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

"To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required.

The number of smores the kids will eat is:
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores

The number of smores the adults will eat is:
6 adults * 1 smore/adult = 6 smores

The total number of smores needed is:
18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, so the number of sleeves needed is:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the number of boxes needed is:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem:

- Let \( D \) represent Dora's age.
- Let \( F \) represent Dora's father's age.
- Let \( M \) represent Dora's mother's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Dora's age \( D = 15 \).
2. Dora's father's age \( F = 2D + 8 \).
3. Dora's mother's age \( M = F - 4 \).

First, we calculate Dora's father's age:
\[ F = 2D + 8 = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age:
\[ M = F - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

"To determine how many votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes each candidate received.

1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received:
   - Candidate A got 20% of the votes.
   - 20% of 100 votes = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. Calculate the number of votes candidate B received:
   - Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - 50% of 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
   - Therefore, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. Calculate the number of votes candidate C received:
   - The total number of votes is 100.
   - Votes for candidate A and B together = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.
   - Therefore, votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving away 10 apples, Boris has:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck, after receiving 10 apples, has:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction. This is calculated as:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we first calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then sum these amounts.

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we sum the total amount of water used for all the cubes:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how many ounces are left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of books each person has in terms of Steven's books. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \).

1. Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and we know Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   2S = 20
   \]
   Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   So, Steven has 10 books.

2. Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, the number of books Alice has is:
   \[
   S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
   \]
   So, Alice has 16 books.

3. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
   \[
   20 - 16 = 4
   \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

2. **Trading 90% of Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27).

3. **Trading 50% of Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).

4. **Trading the Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 60 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 63 small buttons.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long they drove. The total travel time was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:
\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance they drove is calculated by multiplying the driving time by their driving speed:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \times 50 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 17 more fish, the total number of fish he had was:

\[ 3 + O \text{ (orange fish)} \]
\[ 4 + W \text{ (white fish)} \]

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O = 5 + 2W \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Substituting \( O = 5 + 2W \) into the equation \( O + W = 17 \):

\[ 5 + 2W + W = 17 \]
\[ 5 + 3W = 17 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of employees after three months:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Now, calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times \$4000 \text{ salary/employee} = \$1,040,000 \text{ per month} \]

Finally, calculate the total salary paid over three months:
\[ \$1,040,000 \text{ per month} \times 3 \text{ months} = \$3,120,000 \]

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. She plays for half an hour every day, so for 14 days, that's:
\[ 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, for the following week, she plays for 2 hours every day, so for 7 days, that's:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix made $105 in a week. Since he charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. First, calculate the total number of petals from the flowers she initially picked:
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

2. Add these together to get the total number of petals before any flowers were dropped:
   \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

3. Since she dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals from one of each type:
   - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
   - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
   - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
   - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

4. Add these together to get the total number of petals from the dropped flowers:
   \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

5. Subtract the petals from the dropped flowers from the total number of petals:
   \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 79.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jack and his three friends over the 4-hour period.

First, let's determine how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 / 2 = 10\) minutes.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters
- Friend 1: \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters
- Friend 2: \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Thus, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum these times.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - She records 18 videos each week.
   - Total time per week: \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.
   - Total time per month (4 weeks): \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Total time per month (4 weeks): \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - She spends 15 minutes six days a week.
   - Total time per week: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes.
   - Total time per month (4 weeks): \( 90 \times 4 = 360 \) minutes.

"To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items she needs installed beyond what is included in the standard installation package.

The standard installation package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors (2 additional mirrors)
- 2 chandeliers (1 additional chandelier)
- 20 pictures (10 additional pictures)

The additional items are:
- 2 additional mirrors
- 1 additional chandelier
- 10 additional pictures

The cost for each additional item is $15.00. Therefore, the total number of additional items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 additional items

The cost for the additional items is:
13 items * $15.00/item = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the standard installation fee and the cost for the additional items:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the information step by step.

1. First, determine how much Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00:
   \[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

2. Next, calculate how much Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
   \[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

3. Add this 40% to Anthony's savings to get Roy's total savings:
   \[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given as 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   \[
   \text{Saskay's height} = 12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   \[
   \text{Kagiyami's height} = 4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   \[
   \text{Naruto's height} = 10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Finally, we need to convert Naruto's lifting height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot:
\[
\text{Naruto's height in feet} = \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of his journey and then sum them up.

1. For the first part of the journey, Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance for this part is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part of the journey, Mason continues to travel at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for another 6 hours. The distance for this part is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances from both parts of the journey:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance covered by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of four turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.

First, calculate how many dishes Rory made:
Rory = Kora + 20
Rory = 20 + 20
Rory = 40

Next, calculate how many dishes Jada made:
Jada = 2 * Rory
Jada = 2 * 40
Jada = 80

Now, add up the dishes made by all three:
Total dishes = Kora + Rory + Jada
Total dishes = 20 + 40 + 80
Total dishes = 140

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her job earnings, and her mom's contribution:
\[ P + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the reduced price of the laptop:
\[ P + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ P + 230 = 350 \]
\[ P = 350 - 230 \]
\[ P = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

From the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

From the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Total slices from all apples:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production with the current number of cows. 

The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total milk production per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

Each group requires:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to 10 minutes per group.

Additionally, there is a 10-minute intermission.

First, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Next, we divide the remaining time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we first need to calculate the simple interest earned over this period.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]

However, the rate should be expressed as a fraction of the principal, not as an amount. The correct rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) or 0.75.

So, the correct calculation is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 975 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts without collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Thus, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

Next, we calculate the remaining goats in each farm:

- Initially, Farm X had 55 goats. After selling 10, the remaining goats in Farm X are \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- Initially, Farm Y had 45 goats. After selling 20, the remaining goats in Farm Y are \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left:

- Total goats left = goats left in Farm X + goats left in Farm Y = \(45 + 25 = 70\).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets, taking into account the discount for the red food baskets.

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food effectively costs \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. Add the costs of the green and red food baskets to get the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of green food baskets + Cost of red food baskets
   - Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. The total number of cars is 75.

Now, let's find the number of yellow cars. We know the total number of cars is the sum of the red, green, blue, and yellow cars:
\[
\text{Total cars} = \text{Red cars} + \text{Green cars} + \text{Blue cars} + \text{Yellow cars}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
75 = 12 + 10 + 30 + \text{Yellow cars}
\]
Simplifying the equation:
\[
75 = 52 + \text{Yellow cars}
\]
Solving for the number of yellow cars:
\[
\text{Yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23
\]

So, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Pages read yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.
   - Daniel read 0 pages today.

3. **Calculate the number of pages Denise read today:**
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
   - Denise read 5 more than 13 pages today.
   - Therefore, Denise read \( 13 + 5 = 18 \) pages today.

4. **Total pages read by each:**
   - Denise's total pages: \( 10 \) (yesterday) + \( 18 \) (today) = \( 28 \) pages.
   - Daniel's total pages: \( 13 \) (yesterday) + \( 0 \) (today) = \( 13 \) pages.

5. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - Denise read \( 28 \) pages.
   - Daniel read \( 13 \) pages.
   - The difference is \( 28 - 13 = 15 \) pages.

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have 1 adult bowl.
3. Each of the two children will have 1 child bowl.

First, we convert the adult bowls to child bowls to make the calculations easier:
- 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl = 8/4 = 2 child bowls).

Now, calculate the total number of child bowls used for dinner:
- Calvin and his wife: 2 adults * 2 child bowls/adult = 4 child bowls.
- The two children: 2 children * 1 child bowl/child = 2 child bowls.

Total child bowls used for dinner:
- 4 child bowls (adults) + 2 child bowls (children) = 6 child bowls.

The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the number of child bowls left is:
- 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen. So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen gives us the total amount William spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she bought and then divide the total amount of money she spent by this number.

First, calculate the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 movies.
- She saw each movie 3 times.

Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 times per movie = 27 tickets

Next, we know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 tickets

Now, perform the division:

Average price per ticket = $8

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( D = 60 \)
2. Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \)
3. Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \)
4. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \)

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:

50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Next, we calculate how many tables are needed to fit all 60 boxes, given that 2 boxes fit per table:
60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both the 12-hour stay option with additional hours and the 24-hour stay option, and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the duration of Cameron's stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to midnight (12 am) is 7 hours.
   - From midnight (12 am) to 10 am is 10 hours.
   - Total stay duration: 7 hours + 10 hours = 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**
   - The base cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
   - Cameron stays for 5 additional hours (17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours).
   - The cost for each additional hour is 70 pesos.
   - Total cost for additional hours: 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Total cost using the 12-hour stay option: 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**
   - The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

4. **Determine the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay with additional hours

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the hay needed for the goats:
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. Calculate the hay needed for the sheep:
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total hay needed:
   - Total hay = hay for goats + hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spends on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has:**
   - Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.
   - The teacher has 9 coupons.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles is \( 9 \times 100 = 900 \) bottles.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students:**
   - There are 29 pupils in the class.
   - Each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is \( 29 \times 2 = 58 \) bottles.

3. **Calculate the number of bottles of apple juice left for the teacher:**
   - Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles.
   - The number of bottles left for the teacher is \( 900 - 58 = 842 \) bottles.

Thus, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the fixed visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Visit Fee**: $40
2. **Labor Cost**: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round 2.25 hours up to 3 hours.
   - Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these costs together:
- Total charge = Visit Fee + Labor Cost + Parts Cost
- Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60

Calculating the total:
- Total charge = $205

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs after the 40% discount.

The original cost of each CD is $15. With a 40% discount, the discount amount per CD is:
\[ 15 \times 0.40 = 6 \]

So, the cost per CD after the discount is:
\[ 15 - 6 = 9 \]

The total cost for 10 CDs is:
\[ 10 \times 9 = 90 \]

Next, James sells 5 of the CDs for $40. The total amount he receives from selling these 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

However, this seems incorrect because the selling price per CD should be less than the discounted price he paid. Let's assume he sells each of the 5 CDs for $4 each (since $40 total for 5 CDs is $8 per CD, but we'll use $40 total as given).

The total amount he receives from selling 5 CDs is:
\[ 40 \]

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs from the total amount he spent:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the amount of money James was out is:
\[ 50 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time for the initial swim: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swimming time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time for the remaining swim:**
   - Time for the remaining swim: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Initial swim time: 6 hours.
   - Rest time: 3 hours.
   - Remaining swim time: 8 hours.
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - Total commission from 6 copies = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - Total commission from 10 copies = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15.00.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the thickness by the number of pages per inch:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

However, each sheet of paper has two sides, and each side is considered one page. Therefore, the total number of sheets of paper is half the total number of pages:

\[ \text{Total sheets} = \frac{150 \, \text{pages}}{2} = 75 \, \text{sheets} \]

But the question asks for the total number of pages, which is already calculated as 150 pages.

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

1. Calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: \(15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}\).

2. Determine Vince's stapling rate:
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   - Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: \(900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals}\).

3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   - Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: \(60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports}\).

Thus, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy Calculation:**
   - The hospital has a total of 1000 beds.
   - 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Initial Unoccupied Beds:**
   - Total beds = 1000
   - Occupied beds = 200
   - Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

3. **Admissions Over 2 Weeks:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - 2 weeks = 14 days.
   - Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day \(\times\) 14 days = 700 patients.

4. **Final Occupancy Calculation:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200
   - Additional occupied beds due to admissions = 700
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

5. **Final Unoccupied Beds:**
   - Total beds = 1000
   - Occupied beds after 2 weeks = 900

2. Determine the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day.
3. Use the information that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day. The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Finally, substitute \( S = 147 \) into the second equation to find \( X \):
\[ X = 147 + 5 \]
\[ X = 152 \]

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Total distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
- \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to the same unit (individual brownies). There are 12 brownies in a dozen.

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, add these amounts to find the total number of brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, calculate the number of brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:
- She bought 12 boxes of oranges.

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes.

Now, we find out how many boxes she has left after giving some away:
- 12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes.

Then, we determine how many boxes she kept:
- She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) boxes.

Now, we calculate how many boxes she sold:
- She sold the rest of the boxes, which is 8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
- 6 boxes \(\times\) 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The number of remaining flights is \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11.

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \) years
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \) years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

We are given that the total age of the children is 20 years:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( L \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon is divided into slices for 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total can be expressed as:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated by dividing the size of one adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge of the power bank to determine its initial charge when Maria went to the park.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours at 7% Loss Per Hour:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( C \) be the charge of the power bank at the end of the 5 hours of 9% loss.
   - After 3 hours of 7% loss, the remaining charge is 28%.
   - The charge after 3 hours of 7% loss can be expressed as:
     \[
     C \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     C \times 0.93^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
     \[
     0.93^3 \approx 0.804357
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     C \times 0.804357 = 0.28
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the amount of ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days:**
   - In one day, 40 dwarves mine 1440 pounds.
   - Over 30 days, they can mine \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is 43200 pounds.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for the given packages and then use that to find the cost of the 8-sandwich package.

1. **Calculate the price per sandwich for the first package:**
   - The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50.

2. **Calculate the price per sandwich for the second package:**
   - The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich should be the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich for the third package is also $1.50.

3. **Calculate the cost of the third package:**
   - The third package has 8 sandwiches.
   - Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a substitute is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two sub-scenarios:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - Probability of not turning in homework due to a class extension: 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving a class extension: 60% or 0.60
       - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
       - Probability of not turning in homework due to a personal extension: 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
   - Total probability of not turning in homework: 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Turning in Homework:**
   - Probability of turning in homework: 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 or 24%

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time it takes for Richard to move from the first bottle to the last bottle, dropping the candy in each bottle.

First, let's calculate the number of soda bottles:
- The driveway is 24 feet wide.
- Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.

The number of bottles is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it takes for Richard to move from the first bottle to the last bottle, dropping the candy in each bottle:
- It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
- Since there are 8 bottles, Richard will move from one bottle to the next 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

The total time is:
\[ 7 \text{ moves} \times 5 \text{ seconds per move} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he lost by not working, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost by not working:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

The width of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.
2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Letters delivered on Tuesday: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Letters delivered on Wednesday: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

Now, we sum the letters delivered over the three days:

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. This means he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. This means he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total lost = First race loss + Third race loss - Second race win
- Total lost = $5 + $16.5 - $11 = $10.5

Since there were 3 races, the average loss per race is:
- Average loss = Total lost / Number of races

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for this calculation.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for the price of the car after \( t \) years, given an initial price \( P_0 \) and an annual depreciation rate \( r \), is:
\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

Here, \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars, \( r = 0.21 \), and \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P(3) \approx 9860.78 \]

The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's stickers to his collection, we get:
150 (total from last year) + 100 (this year) = 250 stickers.

Therefore, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection now.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:
   - The cats are fed twice a day.
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total food available = 720 grams.
   - Days the food will last = 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices they ate:
- Becky: 10 slices
- Jake: 7 slices
- Silvia: 14 slices

Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\)

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the times spent by Betsy and Donovan, which is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, therefore, took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Thus, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to sum up the costs for each service provided:

1. Cost of the cast: $200
2. Cost of the visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, so $300 * 0.5 = $150
3. Cost of the painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills, so $4 * 30 = $120
4. Cost of parking: $6/hour for 2 hours, so $6 * 2 = $12

Adding these together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482.

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the daily number of emails requiring a response by 5 to get the total for the week.

First, we know that 20% of the 80 emails do not require a response. Therefore, 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails = 0.80 * 80 = 64 emails per day

Next, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5 to find the total for the week:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost of mailing all the coupons is the sum of the costs for the small and big coupons:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion at the grocery store. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""

First, let's calculate the cost for 2 pounds of butter under the promotion:
- The first pound costs $4.00.
- The second pound is half off, so it costs $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost by determining how many sets of 2 pounds he needs to buy:
- 6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets.

Now, we multiply the cost of one set by the number of sets:
- 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00.

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days), the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys each day is:
\[ \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we can find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during the month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total number of bikes sold**: 300
2. **Number of Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
3. **Number of BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
4. **Number of MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) (since BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \))
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

2. Determine the total number of minutes he spends in class each day.
3. Calculate the total number of minutes he spends in class each week.
4. Calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.
5. Sum the total minutes spent learning in a week and convert it to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of periods John has in a day.**
John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes.
\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ periods per day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of minutes he spends in class each day.**
Each period is 40 minutes long.
\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes he spends in class each week.**
He goes to class 5 days a week.
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.**
He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on each of these days.
\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]
Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 5: Sum the total minutes spent learning in a week and convert it to hours.**
Total minutes spent learning in a week:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes/week} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
3. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining weight after the velociraptors is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).
4. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is the remaining weight after the velociraptors. Therefore, \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. Calculate the total cost:
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

The total cost to paint the room is $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken can from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 9 unshaken sodas

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, leaving:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 8 unshaken sodas

Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving:
- 2 shaken sodas
- 6 unshaken sodas

Now, there are 8 sodas left in total. The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we first need to calculate the distance each train travels in that time.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Therefore, in 3 hours, it will have traveled:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
So, in 3 hours, the second train will have traveled:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of days worked * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. We know that Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances run by Amber and Micah to find the total distance they both ran:

\[ \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance run by all three is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris, so Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
6. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).

Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and this is equal to 16, we can set up the equation:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's John has. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags, so the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 30 M&M's per ounce, the total number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, so the number of small bags he can make is:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M's}}{10 \text{ M&M's per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   - Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   - Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. 

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice Vince’s age. Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four**: 56 eggs.
2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: 30 eggs.
3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline**: 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.
4. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs**: Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted, and \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted. Therefore, \( A = M \).
5. **Total eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline**: \( A + M = 26 \). Since \( A = M \), we have \( 2A = 26 \), so \( A = 13 \) and \( M = 13 \).

6. **Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs**: Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted, and \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted. We know \( C + S = 30 \).
7. **Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah**: \( C = S + 12 \).

Now, substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Now, find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

8. **How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?**:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons.
2. Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
4. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
5. Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

Step 1: Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 25 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 5: Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 6: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we know that her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 1 \text{ mile} \times 10 \text{ minutes per mile} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time for the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. Therefore, the amount she has saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save $28 is:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob initially has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob initially has. According to the problem:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug such that the mixture in Donny's water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed to make a certain number of scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
   - \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

   So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to consider both the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers included in the bouquets.

First, calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Each individual sunflower costs $2.
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold in bouquets per day is:

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the required production:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color:**
   - Total number of octuplets: 8
   - Number dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
   - Number dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

2. **Determine the number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - All blue-wearers wear bows: 2
   - Number of purple-wearers wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

3. **Calculate the total number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - Total wearing bows: 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

4. **Determine the number of octuplets wearing both a bow and purple:**
   - Number of purple-wearers wearing bows: 2

5. **Calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - Probability: \( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers with bows}}{\text{Total number of babies with bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)

6. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - Percentage: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \)

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling all his unused land, we need to break down the sales step by step.

1. **Initial Land Area:**
   Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

2. **First Sale:**
   - He sold half of the land.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - He sold this for $50.

3. **Remaining Land After First Sale:**
   - After selling 40 square meters, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.

4. **Second Sale:**
   - He sold another 1/4 of his remaining land.
   - 1/4 of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - He sold this for $30.

5. **Remaining Land After Second Sale:**
   - After selling 10 square meters, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.

6. **Third Sale:**
   - He sold the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.
   - The total amount from this sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

7. **Total Earnings:**
   - From the first sale: $50
   - From the second sale: $30
   - From the third sale: $90
   - Total earnings: \( 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \) dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land is:

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Masks per outing**: Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
2. **Outings per day**: He goes out three times a day.
3. **Masks per day**: To find the total number of masks used in one day, we multiply the number of masks per outing by the number of outings per day:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]
4. **Masks in 2 days**: To find the total number of masks used in 2 days, we multiply the number of masks used per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
- The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two, so it has \(400 \times 0.60 = 240\) more apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
- Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\).

Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
- John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\).

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.
- John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\).

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. First, we need to find the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (as given)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree:
- 8-year-old tree: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Next, we sum up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **After Giving Money to Their Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, calculate the amount of yellow paint:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is:
  \[
  \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
  \]

Next, calculate the amount of paint used for the other three colors (red, white, and purple):
- The remaining half of the mural is:
  \[
  12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
  \]
- This remaining 6 pints is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, each color uses:
\[
\frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
\]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. Determine Jim's current age:
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

4. **End of the Third Day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days and then determine the initial number of bandages.

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

- **Net change in bandages:**
  - Total ordered - Total used = \(150 - 91 = 59\) bandages.

- **Bandages at the end of the third day:**
  - They had 78 bandages left.

- **Initial number of bandages:**
  - Let \(x\) be the initial number of bandages.
  - After the net change, they had \(x + 59\) bandages.
  - At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages.
  - Therefore, \(x + 59 = 78\).

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut based on the length of hair cut off and add the cost of the color.

1. The cost of the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch of hair cut off. May's hair was reduced from 10 inches to 8 inches, so 2 inches were cut off.

The cost of the haircut is:
2 inches * $30/inch = $60

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
$40 (color) + $60 (haircut) = $100

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and the additional attendance bonus.

First, calculate her earnings from the hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from the hourly wage are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times 1.5 \, \text{\$/hour} = 67.5 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from the hourly wage are:
\[ 67.5 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 270 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, add the attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
- There are 4 weeks in April.

So, her total attendance bonus for April is:
\[ 10 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 40 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, add her hourly wage earnings and the attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
\[ 270 \, \text{\$} + 40 \, \text{\$} = 310 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Jen will receive:
\[ 310 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he completed the task and then sum these amounts.

1. Laundry: $3.00 * 1 = $3.00
2. Cleaning his room: $1.50 * 1 = $1.50
3. Taking the trash out: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
4. Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, we add these amounts together:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) = $9.00

Therefore, Jason earned $9.00 in the two-week period.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
2. Each pack contains 5 pens, so the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

3. She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
   \]

4. Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

5. To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. Therefore, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \( \frac{1}{4} \) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. The number of additional Lodgepole Pine trees is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) trees. Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

4. **Total Number of Trees:**

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Determine the number of remaining fish after accounting for the red-striped fish.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
One-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]
There are 22 fish with red stripes.

Step 2: Determine the number of remaining fish.
Subtract the number of red-striped fish from the total number of fish:
\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]
There are 44 fish remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes.
Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]
There are 20 fish with blue stripes.

Step 4: Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.
\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

"To determine how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, let's break down the information:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, totaling:
   \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) colors from the palettes.

2. She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, totaling:
   \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) colors from the makeup sets.

3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors:
   \( 8 - 4 = 4 \) colors left from the palettes.

4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so half of these colors is:
   \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) colors used.

5. Therefore, the number of colors left from that makeup set is:
   \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) colors.

6. The other two makeup sets remain untouched, so they still have:
   \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) colors.

7. Adding up all the remaining colors:
   \( 4 \) (from the remaining palette) + \( 3 \) (from the partially used makeup set) + \( 12 \) (from the other two makeup sets) = \( 19 \) colors.

Thus, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how long it will take for all the students to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who will try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.**
- There are 10 students from each grade.
- There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th).

Total number of students = 10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students

**Step 2: Determine the number of groups.**
- Each group can have 8 students.

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
Number of groups = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required.**
- Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room.

Total time = Number of groups * Time per group
Total time = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so its length is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds required for 80 meatballs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as:
\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. The total cost without the discount is $35 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) = $75. With a 20% discount, the cost is reduced by 20% of $75, which is $15. So, the discounted cost for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which totals 10 nails. At $3 per nail, the cost for the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Adding the cost of the discounted manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art gives us the total cost: $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made each day.
2. Determine the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Total number of doughnuts made each day
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

Step 2: Total number of doughnuts made in June
June typically has 30 days, so:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 3: Total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June
Each doughnut sells for $2, so:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim will need, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of regular lemonade.
2. Calculate the number of lemons needed for the 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade.
3. Sum the lemons needed for both the regular and extra tart lemonade.

**Step 1: Calculate the lemons for 4 gallons of regular lemonade.**

- 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- 4 gallons of lemonade will require 4 cups of lemon juice.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Therefore, 4 cups of lemon juice will require \(4 \times 6 = 24\) lemons.

   0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of seeds in a large sunflower is:
   \[
   36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds}
   \]

3. To find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:

"First, let's calculate how much allowance Ryan has earned over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, we multiply $6 by 3:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, which is 4 ice cream cones in total. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Finally, we determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we divide $13 by $6.50:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   C + K = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2C + 4K = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   C + 2K = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
   \[
   C + K = 20
   \]
   \[
   C + 2K = 35
   \]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( C \):
   \[
   (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   K = 15
   \]

Now substitute \( K = 15 \) back into the first equation:
   \[
   C + 15 = 20
