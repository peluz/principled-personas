"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair costs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. 

To find 250% of $80,000:
\[ 250\% \times 80,000 = 2.5 \times 80,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Purchase price} + \text{Repair costs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

He runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So for each session, he runs:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

He runs 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs each week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day for all the chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day.
- For 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) cups.

Next, let's determine how much feed has already been given:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
- The total feed given so far is \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups.

Now, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement:
- The remaining feed needed is \( 60 - 40 = 20 \) cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar's purchase of 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break down the cost:
- For every pair of glasses, the first glass costs $5 and the second glass costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost for each pair of glasses is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, he is buying 8 pairs of glasses (16 / 2 = 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Thus, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

4. **Calculate the total number of sheep in all three cities:**
   - Total sheep = Sheep in Seattle + Sheep in Charleston + Sheep in Toulouse
   - Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the different stages of the download process and the interruption.

1. **Initial Download Phase:**
   - Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of the way through the download is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.
   - The time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows update forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarted Download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The total time to download the entire 200 GB file is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the initial download time, the restart time, and the restarted download time.
   - Total time = 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (restarted download) = 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance John initially travels:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Determine the distance John covers during his return trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return trip is 4 hours and he has already spent 2.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance John covers on his return trip:**
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Determine how far John is from home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance traveled back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She works 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - She worked 45 hours in total, so the number of overtime hours is 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost**: $3 for watering and feeding

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost:
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before selling at the orange house, she had \(5 \times 2 = 10\) vacuum cleaners.
2. Before selling at the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners, which means that the 10 vacuum cleaners were what remained after selling 2 more to the red house. Therefore, before selling to the red house, she had \(10 + 2 = 12\) vacuum cleaners.
3. The 12 vacuum cleaners were what remained after selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If 12 is two-thirds of the original amount (since she sold a third at the green house), then the original amount is \(12 \div \frac{2}{3} = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18\).

Thus, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

First, we calculate the daily total:
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of.
- John has 10 dogs.

So, the total time spent per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly total:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total time spent per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins and \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.

We know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know \( S = 40 \), we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships described in the problem step by step.

1. First, we find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]

2. Next, we determine how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each segment of his ping pong play and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
- Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we sum the points from both segments:
- Points in the first 20 minutes: 4
- Points in the second 20 minutes: 5

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts consumed in 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine the cost per yogurt.
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts.
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time available is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the remaining calories.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.**

- The bag has 5 servings.
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

**Step 2: Determine how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.**

- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

**Step 3: Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the remaining calories.**

- Each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g.
- Therefore, each serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60g.
- To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we use the ratio of calories to grams:
  - 250 calories = 60g
  - 1 calorie = 60g / 250 calories = 0.24g
  - 200 calories = 200 * 0.24g = 48g

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   - Cost of each blue tie = $40
   - Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**

1. Each school has 2 teams (one girls' team and one boys' team).
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each team also has 1 coach.

First, calculate the total number of players per school:
- Each school has 2 teams, and each team has 5 players.
- Therefore, each school has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) players.

Next, calculate the total number of coaches per school:
- Each school has 2 teams, and each team has 1 coach.
- Therefore, each school has \(2 \times 1 = 2\) coaches.

Now, calculate the total number of people per school:
- Each school has 10 players and 2 coaches.
- Therefore, each school has \(10 + 2 = 12\) people.

Finally, calculate the total number of people for all four schools:
- There are 4 schools, and each school has 12 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people is \(4 \times 12 = 48\).

"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
2. Calculate the total interest on the cell phones.
3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by the number of months (3) to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
- Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
- Total cost = 5 * $150 = $750

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left in the line is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):

- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

Next, we add the 18 new potted plants she received:
- The total number of potted plants she has now is \( 80 + 18 = 98 \).

Now, let's determine how many plants she will give away:
- She will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the number of plants she will give away is \( 40 \).

Finally, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:
- The number of potted plants she will remain with is \( 98 - 40 = 58 \).

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we add up all the doorbell presses:
- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time based on the rate at which the fog bank moves and the distance it needs to cover.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the fog bank's movement is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

The city is 42 miles across. To find the total time required to cover 42 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times 3.3333 \]
\[ \text{Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of how many pieces Poppy and her mom place and then determine how many pieces are left.

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after Poppy places her pieces, there are:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

2. Her mom then places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after her mom places her pieces, there are:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces remaining}

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. Finally, we multiply that by 3 to get the total volume.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume of one box = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total time he spent watching TV each day and then solve for the unknown.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \(x\) (number of 30-minute episodes) = \(0.5x\) hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV over the week is 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

\[1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplify the equation:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"To determine how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5.
2. Before dropping the 5 cookies, he had \(110 + 5 = 115\) cookies.
3. He baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the number of cookies he intended to bake is \(115 - 15 = 100\).
4. He intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. Therefore, the number of cookies he baked last year is \(100 / 2 = 50\).

Thus, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore is:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased prices. Then, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100

2. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the lumber:**
   - Total cost = $100 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180

4. **Determine the new selling price for each type of board:**
   - The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price is $10 * 1.50 = $15 per board.
   - The price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price is $16 * 1.50 = $24 per board.

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Total revenue for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of sugar to water that Katy uses, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, let's determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We need to find out how many of these 120 parts are sugar.

Since the total mixture is 120 parts and the ratio is 20 parts, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total by the sum of the ratio parts:
120 / 20 = 6

Now, to find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts of sugar in the ratio:
6 * 7 = 42

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach to determine the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Lylah's new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary.
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 \).
   - Total salary = \( 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is \( 99,076.92 \).

"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday. Therefore, she slept:
   - 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours on Tuesday
   - 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours on Wednesday
3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. Therefore, she slept:
   - 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours each day for these four days.

Now, let's calculate the total hours slept for each part of the week:
- **Monday**: 8 hours
- **Tuesday and Wednesday**: 6 hours each day, so 6 hours + 6 hours = 12 hours
- **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**: 7 hours each day, so 7 hours × 4 days = 28 hours

Adding these together gives the total hours slept throughout the week:

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments based on her speed changes.

1. For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: \( 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \)

2. After the first 3 hours, she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (since 7 hours total - 3 hours already run = 4 hours).
   - Distance covered in the next 4 hours: \( 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \)

3. Total distance covered in 7 hours:
   - Total distance = Distance in first 3 hours + Distance in next 4 hours
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

The total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. We can now add the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday and subtract from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday:
\[ 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To determine how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

First, we find the monthly cost:
- Tom gets 4 car washes a month.
- Each car wash costs $15.

Monthly cost = Number of car washes per month × Cost per car wash
Monthly cost = 4 × $15
Monthly cost = $60

Next, we calculate the annual cost:
- There are 12 months in a year.

Annual cost = Monthly cost × Number of months in a year
Annual cost = $60 × 12
Annual cost = $720

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

The problem also states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares.

First, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Next, each hectare produces 100 pineapples per harvest. Therefore, each hectare produces 100 pineapples * 4 harvests = 400 pineapples per year.

John has 10 hectares, so the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is 400 pineapples per hectare * 10 hectares = 4000 pineapples.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 that many bees return. 
   - 1/2 of 30 bees is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Two times 30 bees is 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Initially, 30 bees left and 15 returned, so 15 bees had not returned.
   - Then, 60 more bees left, so the total number of bees that left and had not returned is 15 (from the first group) + 60 (from the second group) = 75 bees.
   - Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 75 bees return to the hive.

The number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 75.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all the days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to gather enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required. Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/session = 5 sessions

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which gives us the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, which gives us the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his walking routine on weekdays and weekends. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

- On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles a day. So, for 5 weekdays, he walks:
  \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \)

- On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day. So, for 2 weekend days, he walks:
  \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \)

Adding these together gives the total miles walked in a week:
\( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \)

4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Find the final amount left.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[

   \]

3. **Remaining Amount after Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + \frac{28}{2}
     \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + 14
     \]
     \[
     M - 2 = 19
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides to solve for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 21
     \]

4. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark:
     \[
     \text{Jean's age} = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
     \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first event is 2 times more likely than the second event.
   - To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
     \[
     (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

Therefore, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and the steps needed to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Total Straw Used**: 160 pieces of straw.
2. **Straw for Hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total straw used for hamsters is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces of straw}
   \]
3. **Straw for Rabbits**: 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
4. **Straw for Rats**: The remaining straw is used for the rats. We can calculate this by subtracting the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total straw:
   \[
   160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces of straw}
   \]
5. **Straw per Rat**: Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
6. **Total Number of Rats**: The total number of rats can be found by dividing the total straw used for rats by the straw per rat:
   \[
   \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats}
   \]
7. **Rats per Cage**: The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
   \[
   \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage}
   \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Total number of cards:**
   Adding up all the cards collected over the three months and the initial number of cards:
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
   \]

Thus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher.
   - Total sentences edited per week = 1000.
   - Sentences edited for each publisher = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences.

2. **Determine the payment rates:**
   - Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

3. **Calculate earnings from each publisher:**
   - Earnings from Publisher A = 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.
   - Earnings from Publisher B = 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

4. **Calculate total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B
   - Total earnings = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

1. **One-time monetary reward:**
   - John receives a one-time reward of $5000.

2. **Weekly salary before the raise:**
   - John's original weekly salary is $2000.

3. **Annual salary before the raise:**
   - Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary before the raise is:
     \[
     2000 \times 52 = 104,000
     \]

4. **5% raise in salary:**
   - The raise is 5% of his original annual salary:
     \[
     0.05 \times 104,000 = 5,200
     \]

5. **New annual salary after the raise:**
   - Adding the raise to his original annual salary:
     \[
     104,000 + 5,200 = 109,200
     \]

"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we can break down his cheese consumption over the week:

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese in one big dish of macaroni and cheese.

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93:
- The formula for the average is: (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)
- We want the average of the five highest scores to be 93.
- Therefore, the total score needed for the five highest scores is: 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we need to find the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 92, 100, 86
- Sum of these scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total score of the five highest tests will be the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests plus the score on the sixth test:
- Total score needed: 367 + \( x \) = 465

Solving for \( x \):
- \( x = 465 - 367 \)
- \( x = 98 \)

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride = 125 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for four weeks = 125 kilometers/week * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers.

For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride = 120 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for three weeks = 120 kilometers/week * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers.

Adding the kilometers from both periods:
- Total kilometers = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g.

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g.

3. **Total weight of the bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples
   - Total weight = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost for 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Total cost for 240 cups is $34800.
   - Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the amount needed by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given. Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens and \( w \) represent the number of white chickens.

We know the following:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

We can set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for the perimeter and Gary's walking speed:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can break down the information given:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days was 500.

Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \(x\). The total number of customers over the three days can be expressed as:
\[100 + 150 + x = 500\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[250 + x = 500\]
\[x = 500 - 250\]
\[x = 250\]

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces and then calculate the total time required to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

1. **Determine Kalinda's rate:**
   - Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine her mom's rate:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.
   - Therefore, her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

3. **Calculate their combined rate:**
   - Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate
   - Combined rate = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute

4. **Calculate the total time required to complete the puzzle:**
   - Total pieces to be placed = 360 pieces
   - Time required = Total pieces / Combined rate
   - Time required = 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of what happened to the watermelons over time.

1. **Initial Count**: The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.

2. **First Harvest**:
   - 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - 30% of 120 is calculated as \( 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \) watermelons.
   - After harvesting 36 watermelons, the remaining number of watermelons is \( 120 - 36 = 84 \).

3. **Second Harvest**:
   - Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - 3/4 of 84 is calculated as \( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \) watermelons.
   - After harvesting 63 watermelons, the remaining number of watermelons is \( 84 - 63 = 21 \).

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key pieces of information and setting up the equations based on the given conditions.

1. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
3. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

The total weight of the tree is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, so:

\[ 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is:

   - Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow.
   - Similarly, we find out how many dozens 30 cookies make:
     \[
     \frac{30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies per dozen}} = 2.5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - Therefore, the flour needed for 30 cookies is:
     \[
     2.5 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ cups per dozen} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total flour needed:**
   - Adding the flour needed for today and tomorrow:
     \[
     6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Thus, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup. 

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = 6,200 \text{ pennies} \]

Since 100 pennies make up 1 dollar, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars:

\[ \frac{6,200}{100} = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is 62 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Therefore, Ferdinand has:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees}
   \]
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Therefore, Harry has:
   \[
   2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees}
   \]
4. To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
   \[
   11 - 3 = 8
   \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

"To find out how much money all three girls have combined, we first need to determine how much each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
Samantha = $100 + $25 = $125

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
Daisy = $125 + $50 = $175

Now, to find the total amount of money all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts:
Total = Carmen + Samantha + Daisy
Total = $100 + $125 + $175
Total = $400

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Selling Price of the House**: $350,000
2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]
3. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the House**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

5. **Difference from Budget**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount he paid off.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   - Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   - Selling price = $400,000
   - Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fees:**
   - Brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fees = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   - Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fees
   - Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Total amount paid = Remaining loan amount + Total fees
   - Remaining loan amount = $250,000
   - Total amount paid = $250,000 + $32,000 = $282,000

5. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total amount paid
   - Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given and calculate the lines for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines in the lyrics.
   - All 54 lines are his to memorize.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[
3S + 9 = 27

"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, we first calculate the total number of stars contributed by the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows.

- There are three rows of 8 stars each, so the total number of stars in these rows is:
  \[
  3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars}
  \]

- There are two rows of 6 stars each, so the total number of stars in these rows is:

Subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"Let's break down the points each player has after the third round and then calculate the points after the fourth round.

1. **Points after the third round:**
   - Mike: 21 points
   - Jim: 21 - 3 = 18 points
   - Tony: 2 * 21 = 42 points

2. **Points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike: Since Mike has over 20 points, he gets an extra point. So, Mike's total is 21 + 1 = 22 points.
   - Jim: Since Jim has less than 20 points, he does not get an extra point. So, Jim's total remains 18 points.
   - Tony: Since Tony has over 20 points, he gets an extra point. So, Tony's total is 42 + 1 = 43 points.

3. **Total points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

Adding these together, the total points for all three players is:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each son washes and then subtract the total number of washed oranges from the original 15 oranges.

1. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
2. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 4 years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
8 (oldest son) + 4 (youngest son) = 12 oranges washed.

Finally, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges:
15 (total oranges) - 12 (washed oranges) = 3 oranges left unwashed.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members who each consume 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household:
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Total rice consumption per meal = 0.2 kg/person * 5 persons = 1 kg.

2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day:
   - The household eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).
   - Total rice consumption per day = 1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day.

3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total rice consumption per week = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week.

4. Determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the pages. Each piece of paper, when folded, creates four pages: two on the front and two on the back. 

In a 32-page tabloid, the pages are arranged such that:
- Page 1 is on the left back.
- Page 2 is on the left front.
- Page 32 is on the right back.
- Page 31 is on the right front.

This means that each piece of paper contains 4 pages. To find the total number of pieces of paper, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per piece of paper:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 8.

"To calculate Watson's earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus, given that the company performed well for the entire month.

1. **Calculate the weekly earnings from the hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours per week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week
   - Hourly wage = $10/hour
   - Weekly earnings from hourly wage = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

2. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Weekly bonus = $300
   - Total weekly earnings = $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week

3. **Calculate the total earnings for April:**
   - April typically has 4 weeks.
   - Total earnings for April = 4 weeks * $800/week = $3200

"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total loaves produced each day**: 60 loaves.
2. **Loaves sold in the morning**: Two-thirds of the total loaves.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. **Loaves remaining after the morning sales**:
   \[
   \text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. **Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening**: Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. **Loaves sold in the afternoon**:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy loses:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Sandy} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over a period of fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and new legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculating the number of new arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated by dividing the total number of days by the interval at which new arms grow:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ new arms}
     \]

2. **Calculating the number of new legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated by dividing the total number of days by the interval at which new legs grow:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ new legs}
     \]

3. **Calculating the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ new arms} + 3 \text{ new legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, the serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

First, combine the terms on the left side:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers × Salary of junior programmers.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 × $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers × Salary of senior programmers.
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = 60 × $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers:**
   - Total payroll for all programmers = Total payroll for junior programmers + Total payroll for senior programmers.
   - Total payroll for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. So, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \( 24 - 2 = 22 \) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \( 22 - 14 = 8 \) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys:
   \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) lollipops.
5. Adding the lollipops he bought to the ones he has left:
   \( 8 + 28 = 36 \) lollipops.
6. He eats 3 lollipops that night:
   \( 36 - 3 = 33 \) lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge required:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, it will take:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the customer had $4 in rewards to use on their current shopping trip. 

On this trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 in rewards, and the coupon they applied took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract both the rewards and the coupon discount from the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To determine which job offers Nick a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for the respective taxes.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Thus, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts: the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge.

1. **Sugar for the suckers:**
   - Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
   - He wants to make 8 batches of suckers.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

2. **Sugar for the fudge:**
   - Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
   - He wants to make 1 batch of fudge.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

3. **Total sugar needed:**
   - Add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge: \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

Thus, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, therefore, has \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
   - Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - According to the problem, Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total:
     \[
     C + H = 60
     \]
   - He has twice as many chickens as cows:
     \[
     H = 2C
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the first equation:
     \[
     C + 2C = 60
     \]
     \[
     3C = 60
     \]
     \[
     C = 20

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the animals and the container:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

2. **Determine the amount of change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, so the total change he had before buying gumballs is twice the cost of the gumballs.
   - Total change before buying gumballs = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00.

3. **Determine how much money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy started with $10 and had $4.00 left as change.
   - Money spent on candy = $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.50 per pound.
   - Number of pounds of candy = $6.00 / $1.50 per pound = 4 pounds.

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip and then determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. **Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

4. **Determine how many days the train can operate before reaching 18,000 miles:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can operate, we divide 18,000 miles by the daily distance traveled: 
   \[
   \frac{18,000}{900} = 20

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The amount of stuffing for a collie bed is the average of these two amounts:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
   - According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

2. **Number of people kicked out for shoplifting:**
   - The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5.
   - Therefore, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \).
   - Substituting \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
     \]

3. **Number of people kicked out for physical violence:**
   - The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.
   - Therefore, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

4. **Total number of people kicked out:**
   - The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.
   - Therefore, the total number of people kicked out is:
     \[
     3 + 7 + 21 = 31
     \]

5. **Number of people kicked out for other reasons:**
   - The total number of people kicked out is 50.
   - The number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
     \[
     50 - 31 = 19

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle discount:**
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the discount is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
   - With a 20% discount, the savings on the bundle is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of the bundle is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services:**
   - The total cost for Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus bundle) = $26 per month.

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.
   - The cost of the streaming services is $26 per month.
   - The savings is $60 - $26 = $34 per month.

"To determine the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time spent on all activities and then find the proportion of that time spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 1.5 hours

Next, we calculate the total time spent on all activities:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we find the percentage of the total time spent editing:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Thus, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica had initially and then subtract the number she passed out and add the number she received.

1. Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
3. Adding the cards she made and the cards her dad brought, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards initially.
4. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she passed out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
5. Subtracting the cards she passed out from the initial total, she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.
6. She received 17 cards from family and friends, so adding these to the remaining cards, she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4:
- Flour: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)
- Milk: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Next, we need to determine how many 2-cup bags of flour and 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

For flour:
- \(12 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bag} = 6 \text{ bags}\)

For milk:
- \(4 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bottle} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

Now, we find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- \(6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4\)

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

2. Convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
   - 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatts = 7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day.

3. Calculate the energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours:
   - New usage time = 8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - New daily energy consumption in kilowatts = 2700 watts/day / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

   - From the average trees: Let this be \( x \) apples

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both sisters:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 \)
   - Combined total: \( (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500 \)

Now, let's set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels.
2. Let \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
- The total number of humps is 304.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokémon cards Kenny started with. Let's break down the information given:

1. Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. After selling the cards, he has $50 left for spending cash.
4. He keeps 1/3 of his cards.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kenny needs to have after selling the cards:
- Cost of the ticket: $100
- Spending cash: $50
- Total money needed: $100 + $50 = $150

Next, we need to determine how many cards he sold to make $150:
- Each card is sold for $1.5.
- Number of cards sold = Total money needed / Price per card
- Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he sold (100 cards) represents 2/3 of his total collection. Let's denote the total number of cards he started with as \( x \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would only have one hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26 / 2 = 13 guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 13.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that Indras has 6 letters in her name.
2. We need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.
3. Half of the letters in Indras' name is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).
4. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this, so \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) letters.
5. Now, we add the number of letters in both names: \( 6 + 7 = 13 \).

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount. 

1. The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
2. The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
3. The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost:
$165.00 * 0.80 = $132.00.

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is $132.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a few steps to convert the amount of gasoline from gallons to pints. 

First, we determine how much gas is in one container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers:
\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we find out how much gas Josey needed, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container:
\[ \text{Gas needed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon:
\[ \text{Pints needed} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had 1% of his money left after spending, which means he spent 99% of his money.
   - If 1% of his money is the remaining amount, then 1% of $5 is $0.05.
   - Therefore, 99% of $5 is $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents.
   - The total cost for the chips is 3 * 40 cents = 120 cents = $1.20.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To determine the cost of the potting soil for Bob's raised beds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.**
The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (raised bed) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds.**
\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.**
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost.**
Each bag costs $12.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the potting soil is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - There are 15 red cards.
   - Green cards are 60% more than the red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - Yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards.
   - The sum of red and green cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 39.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Total number of cards = number of red cards + number of green cards + number of yellow cards.
   - Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

The total number of cards is 78.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies:
8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies

Total number of puppies with spots:
3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.35 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 35 \]

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer needs exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

We are given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| \]

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21°F.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3°F.

First, we add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these 3 countries is -10°F.

"To determine how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the total amount he still needs to save. The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4, so the remaining amount is:

$12 - $4 = $8

The child plans to save $2 each day. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 ÷ $2/day = 4 days

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs Jaime can place on the trays and how many will be left over. Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is:

24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs in total. To find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the trays, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

Therefore, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the trays is 16.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Razors Before Discount:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost of 2 packs:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Cost Per Razor:**
   - The total cost after the coupon is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

6. **Convert to Cents:**
   - \$0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer and then convert the total height from inches to feet.

1. **Bottom Layer (4 girls):**
   - Each of the 4 girls is 64 inches tall.
   - Total height for the bottom layer: \( 4 \times 64 = 256 \) inches.

2. **Middle Layer (3 girls):**
   - Each of the 3 girls is 64 inches tall.
   - Total height for the middle layer: \( 3 \times 64 = 192 \) inches.

3. **Top Layer (2 girls):**
   - Each of the 2 girls is 64 inches tall.
   - Total height for the top layer: \( 2 \times 64 = 128 \) inches.

4. **Top Girl:**
   - The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   - Total height for the top girl: \( 60 \) inches.

Now, we add up the heights of all the layers:
\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we know David found 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that fraction into yards based on the total length of a skein.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

This means they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn together. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate the total yards used by multiplying \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of cows on the farm**: 30 cows.
2. **Number of sheep on the farm**: The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. The zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) sheep.
3. **Number of cows at the zoo**: The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. The farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cows.
4. **Number of sheep at the zoo**: 20 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo:

- **Total animals on the farm**: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to figure out how many cups of raisins she will allocate to the oatmeal cookies. Since she divides the 27 cups of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each category gets:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. Therefore, the number of batches she can make is:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches} \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate the total electric consumption and the cost for both scenarios.

1. **Current Consumption:**
   - Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
   - Weekly consumption: \( 12 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2016 \text{ kW/week} \).

2. **Cost of Current Consumption:**
   - Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50.
   - Weekly cost: \( 2016 \text{ kW/week} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kW} = 3024 \text{ dollars/week} \).

3. **New Device Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
   - Weekly consumption of the new device: \( 2 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 336 \text{ kW/week} \).

4. **Total Consumption After Adding the Device:**
   - Total weekly consumption: \( 2016 \text{ kW/week} + 336 \text{ kW/week} = 2352 \text{ kW/week} \).

5. **Cost of Total Consumption After Adding the Device:**
   - Weekly cost: \( 2352 \text{ kW/week} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kW} = 3528 \text{ dollars/week} \).

6. **Difference in Weekly Electric Bill:**
   - Difference: \( 3528 \text{ dollars/week} - 3024 \text{ dollars/week} = 504 \text{ dollars/week} \).

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is 504.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person can paint a house.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.
2. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house is:
   \[
   10 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 240 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. If one person takes 240 hours to paint a whole house, the rate of one person is:
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ house}}{240 \text{ hours}}
   \]
4. For 5 people working together, the combined rate is:
   \[
   5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{240 \text{ hours}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{240 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{48 \text{ hours}}
   \]
5. Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the question.

1. Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
2. Let \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has.
3. Let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has.
4. Let \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3C_O \).
- Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

First, we solve for \( C_O \) using the information about Ophelia's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find \( C_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's and Ophelia's chairs:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find \( S_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out the cost of the headphone set. 

Tom paid a total of $48 for both the CD and the headphone set. The cost of the CD is $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:

\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had an additional $44 to spend. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we can start by calculating the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week, and then add the extra hours from the weeks he worked out more.

1. If Josh worked out 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, the total would be:
   \( 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \)

2. However, he worked out 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, which is 1 hour extra per week for two weeks:
   \( 1 \text{ extra hour/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 2 \text{ extra hours} \)

3. Additionally, he worked out 6 hours in one week, which is 2 hours extra for that week:
   \( 2 \text{ extra hours} \)

Adding these extra hours to the base total:
\( 32 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ extra hours} + 2 \text{ extra hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \)

Thus, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. So, one-third of 21 is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:
\[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25.

"To find the cost of one monitor, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors:
- Total cost of all items: $2,400
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700

The combined cost of the 2 monitors is:
$2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
$600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice that of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:

- Buttons with 4 holes: 21 - 7 = 14

Next, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 2 holes:
- Number of buttons with 2 holes: 7
- Holes per button: 2
- Total holes for these buttons: 7 * 2 = 14

Then, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 4 holes:
- Number of buttons with 4 holes: 14
- Holes per button: 4
- Total holes for these buttons: 14 * 4 = 56

Finally, we add the total holes from both types of buttons:
- Total holes: 14 (from 2-hole buttons) + 56 (from 4-hole buttons) = 70

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is:
   \[
   \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, Peter's locker is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the daily recommended amount of coffee and how much Octavia and Juan currently drink.

1. Let's denote the daily recommended amount of coffee as \( R \) cups.
2. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.
3. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

We know from the problem that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups, so \( R = 4 \).

Now, we can calculate how much Juan currently drinks:
\[ 5R = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, the reduction required is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs. 

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles required:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"To determine how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- Total pages in two weeks = \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, he will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( x + 7 \) years old.

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy, we can break down the payments as follows:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, for three teeth, she received:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, she received:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
   \]
   Therefore, for two teeth, she received:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
9.00

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Determine the difference between the total demand and the total supply.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second shop orders 15 roses, and the third shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total weekly demand is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Now, we calculate the total monthly demand:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine the difference between the total demand and the total supply:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage increase can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 4\% \]

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature.

Let \( x \) be the set temperature. The actual temperature is 4% higher than \( x \):
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = x + 0.04x \]
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = 1.04x \]

We know the actual temperature should be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \( 1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds} \).

2. **Weight gain with donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \( 1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} \).

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - The difference in weight between the two options is the sum of the weight loss and the weight gain, since one is a loss and the other is a gain.
   - Difference = \( 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds} \).

Thus, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the number of people attending based on the information provided.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will bring 2 friends, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 additional people.
3. Therefore, from the email invitations, the total number of people is 100 (initial) + 200 (friends) = 300 people.
4. Alex then calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. This adds 8 more people (one spouse per friend).
5. Therefore, from the phone calls, the total number of people is 10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18 people.

Adding the totals from both the email and phone invitations:
300 (from emails) + 18 (from phone calls) = 318 people.

Thus, Alex will need 318 seats.

"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Dachshund} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Papillon} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Mastiff} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow from 4 feet to a height greater than 20 feet, given that it doubles in height every day.

Let's start with the initial height of the beanstalk:
- Day 0: 4 feet

Now, we calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet:
- Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - A cup of mushrooms (100 grams) contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, 1 gram of mushrooms contains \( \frac{3}{100} = 0.03 \) grams of protein.

2. **Calculate the protein content for 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms contain \( 200 \times 0.03 = 6 \) grams of protein.

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.
   - Over a week (7 days), he gets \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams of protein.

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age.

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to earn.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the base cost is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

2. **Subtract the deposit George has already paid:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

3. **Determine how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: \(3900 \div 15 = 260\) hours.

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \) degrees, respectively.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we need to find the measure of the largest angle, which is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

- Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of money Colby has:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 ÷ 5 = 69

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ruiz's production rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's production rate is \( \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

2. **Determine Marissa's production rate:**
   - Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

3. **Calculate the total production for 12 hours:**
   - Ruiz's production in 12 hours: \( 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Marissa's production in 12 hours: \( 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together:**
   - Total production = Ruiz's production + Marissa's production
   - Total production = 720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1800.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.
3. Calculate how many months the tires will last.
4. Convert the number of months into years.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 3: Calculate how many months the tires will last.**

To find out how many months the tires will last, divide the total number of rotations the tires can handle by the number of rotations per month:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

**Step 4: Convert the number of months into years.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. 

The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. Therefore, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per wash. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents).

The cost per wash is:
\[ \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{240 \text{ washes}} = 10 \text{ cents per wash} \]

Since each wash uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is:
\[ 10 \text{ cents} \]

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. So, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600 to get the speed in kb per hour:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/second} \times 3600 \, \text{seconds/hour} = 72000 \, \text{kb/hour} \]

Next, we convert kb per hour to Mb per hour. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:
\[ 72000 \, \text{kb/hour} \div 1000 = 72 \, \text{Mb/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cars towed over the week, considering the different numbers of cars towed on different days.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. Therefore, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. Adding the totals from the first three days and the remaining four days gives us the total number of cars towed for the week:
   \[
   30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to first convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, 4 feet is equivalent to 48 inches.

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches.

The difference in height that Adam needs to grow is:
48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, the number of years required for him to grow 8 inches is:
8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales revenue from the cars.
2. Determine the cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit from the sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sales revenue.**
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Sales Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to acquire the cars.**
The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, while Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to close a 75-mile gap at this rate, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per class over $10.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: $60
2. **Total Number of Classes**: 10

If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

This is within the acceptable limit of $10 per class. Now, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. The number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class if he misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of customers Julie can process daily, given that she operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.

1. Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
2. Julie processes customers at twice the rate of Jewel, so Julie processes \(50 \times 2 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
- Jewel processes 50 customers.
- Julie processes 100 customers.
- Together, they process \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers daily.

Since they work all days of the week (7 days), we multiply the daily total by 7 to find the weekly total:
- Weekly total = \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers.

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot, the total time \( T \) can be calculated by:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To determine how much of Sally's wage was withheld, we need to calculate the total amount of money that should have been in her bank account if she had received her full wage and then compare it to the actual amount in her account.

1. Sally's bank account started with $200.
2. Her weekly wage should be $300.
3. If she had received her full wage, her bank account would have $200 (initial amount) + $300 (wage) = $500.
4. However, her bank account now holds $420.
5. The difference between what her account should hold and what it actually holds is $500 - $420 = $80.

Therefore, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required for her 16 guests. Each guest is expected to eat 3 deviled egg halves, so for 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs required to make 48 deviled egg halves is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Eggs are typically sold by the dozen, so we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:
\[ \text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. **Initial cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly fuel cost**: Twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Hanger rental + Fuel cost
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost:
- Total cost = Initial cost + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the cooking times for each item based on the information provided:

1. **Cooking time for rice**: 30 minutes.
2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. **Cooking time for beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times of rice, pork, and beans:
\[ 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \]

Thus, the total cooking time for all the food is 120 minutes.

- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds at $10 per pound: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
2. Determine the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
4. Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee.

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Next, Roger needs 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, he needs:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]

The total cost of the coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also bought a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers and math teachers on the school basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Kassidy has:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia.
   - Therefore, Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\) dollars.

2. **Determine how much money Rayna has:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - Therefore, Rayna has \(90 + 60 = 150\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money they have together:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has $90.
   - Rayna has $150.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are: good, neutral, and good.

So, we add these to the counts:
- **Good Days**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.
- **Neutral Days**: 10 (initial) + 1 (next three days) = 11 days.
- **Bad Days**: 8 (initial) + 0 (next three days) = 8 days.

Now, we need to determine how many good days are left in the month. Since the month has 30 days, and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 initial + 3 next), we need to consider only the first 30 days.

The total number of good days in the first 30 days is 12. Since the next three days include 2 good days, we need to subtract these from the total good days in the month:

- **Good Days Left in the Month**: 12 (initial) - 2 (next three days) = 10 days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we'll convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

The bamboo needs to grow to 600 inches. The current height is 240 inches, so the additional growth needed is:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

4. When James returns, he finds that there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one for each dog, so he now has 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

1. Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
3. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
4. We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( C + 7 = 68 \). Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 61 \).
5. Now, we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
6. Max has \( 61 + 12 = 73 \) cookies.
7. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \( 73 + 23 = 96 \) cookies.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies they have together:
- Katarina: 68 cookies

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to account for both the 50% extension and the additional 20 cm of lace trim.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \).

1. The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length after the extension is:
   \[
   L + 0.5L = 1.5L
   \]

2. An additional 20 cm of lace trim is added to the bottom of the dress, making the final length:
   \[
   1.5L + 20 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1.5L + 20 = 140
   \]

4. To solve for \( L \), first subtract 20 cm from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   1.5L = 120
   \]

5. Next, divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[
   L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2W + 3T = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( W = T + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(T + 7) + 3T = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( T \):

\[ 2T + 14 + 3T = 44 \]
\[ 5T + 14 = 44 \]

"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework and subtract that from the time he has before dinner.

John has:
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Total homework time:
20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before dinner, which is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

This means the cost for the four candies is:

$3.20 (total cost) - $2.00 (cost of lollipops) = $1.20

The cost of one candy is:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00

The cost for 10 candies is:

10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives the total cost:

$4.00 (lollipops) + $3.00 (candies) = $7.00

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each of them saves over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together gives us the combined savings:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

"To determine the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0 \) dollar.
   - The crate contains 5 bananas.
   - Total cost of bananas: \( 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The crate contains 12 apples.
   - Total cost of apples: \( 12 \times 0.5 = 6.0 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \( 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0 \) dollars.
   - The crate contains 7 oranges.
   - Total cost of oranges: \( 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges: \( 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0 \) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is 32.0 dollars.

   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares**: The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares**: The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.

   \]

4. **White Squares**: The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   \[
   \text{White squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 8 feet and 4 inches is:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches.

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:

1. Calculate the initial number of glasses and plates sent to the party.
2. Subtract the number of broken items from the initial total.

First, convert the dozens to individual items:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 × 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 × 12 = 48 plates

Next, subtract the broken items:
- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Now, calculate the remaining items:
- Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Finally, add the remaining glasses and plates to get the total number of items Jeff has now:
- Total remaining items: 86 + 42 = 128

"To solve this problem, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27).

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 60 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 3 small stickers left, which are worth 3 small buttons.

   Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29
   Total small buttons = 60 + 3 = 63

6. **Final Total:**
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 29 + 63 = 92

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 92.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Number of small shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up all the shirts:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If 6 Pomeranian girls represent one third of the Pomeranians, then the total number of Pomeranians is 6 * 3 = 18.
3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 Pomeranians represent two thirds of the total number of puppies, then the total number of puppies can be found by setting up the equation: \( \frac{2}{3} \times \text{total puppies} = 18 \).

To find the total number of puppies, we solve for the total:
\[ \text{total puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. The third house needs double the first house, which is:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours.
- Their average speed while driving was 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's determine the distance they hiked:
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- Their average hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half their driving speed = 50 miles/hour ÷ 2 = 25 miles/hour.
- Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour.
- Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance to their vacation spot:
- Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

   - Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
   - Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points for enemies: Emma gets \( 10E \) points, and Ava gets \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \) points.

2. **Points for berries collected:**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points for berries: Emma gets \( 5B \) points, and Ava gets \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \) points.

3. **Points for time left:**
   - Let \( T \) be the number of seconds Emma has left on the timer.
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points for time: Emma gets \( 30T \) points, and Ava gets \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \) points.

Now, we calculate the total scores for both Ava and Emma:

- **Emma's total score:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2(4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Expand and simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

2. Determine the amount of fuel used per week.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, which is a round trip of:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (one way)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles per day} \]

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total distance per week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used per week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the amount of fuel used per week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons per week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.**

The price of gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of the fuel used per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons per week} \times 3 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Thus, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, which includes the quarters and a portion of the twenties.

First, let's determine the total value of the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- The total value of the quarters is \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

Next, let's determine the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has 10 twenties.
- The total value of the twenties is \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties:
- \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 200 dollars is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the portion of the twenties she spent:
- Total amount spent = value of quarters + value of spent twenties
- Total amount spent = 35 + 120 = 155 dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \).

Next, we calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

Finally, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to get the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total number of TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   - One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40.
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   - One-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs.
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \).

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:
   - The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs.
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs).
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25.

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to keep the temperature above 32 degrees.

1. **Calculate the night temperature:**
   - Day temperature: 45 degrees
   - Night temperature is 33 degrees colder than the day temperature.
   - Night temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

2. **Determine the temperature increase needed:**
   - The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees.
   - Current night temperature: 12 degrees
   - Required temperature: 32 degrees
   - Temperature increase needed = 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

3. **Calculate the number of logs needed:**
   - Each log heats the house by 5 degrees.
   - Number of logs needed = Temperature increase needed / Degrees per log
   - Number of logs needed = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed from the 90 people. Since each group consists of 9 people, we divide the total number of people by the group size:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of groups bringing seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. Thus, the total number of seashells brought back by each group is:

\[ \text{Seashells per group} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Finally, to find the total number of seashells brought back by all the groups, we multiply the number of seashells per group by the number of groups bringing seashells:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 18 = 108 \]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean have made their S'mores and after accounting for the dropped marshmallows. 

1. The total number of marshmallows in the bag is 35.
2. John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
3. DeSean makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
4. They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, we calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:
- Marshmallows used by John: 9
- Marshmallows used by DeSean: 9
- Marshmallows dropped: 3

Total marshmallows used and lost: 9 + 9 + 3 = 21

Next, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and lost from the initial number of marshmallows:
- Initial number of marshmallows: 35
- Total marshmallows used and lost: 21

Remaining marshmallows: 35 - 21 = 14

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \)

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \)

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces. Let:
- \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest,
- \( f \) be the amount of fragrance,
- \( s \) be the amount of salt,
- \( g \) be the amount of sugar,
- \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( z = f \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance),
2. \( s = g \) (the same amount of salt as sugar),
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt),
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest).

We also know the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Thus, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To determine how much money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add these amounts together.

1. Calculate the total cost of the goats:
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

2. Calculate the total cost of the cows:
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

3. Add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
   - Total amount spent = Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows = $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500 at the market.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he remains with \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the total hours into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards each person has in terms of PJ's cards. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards. According to the problem:

- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. To find out how many cards Becca has:

\[ 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To determine how much money Roy has, we need to follow the information step by step.

1. **Eva's Savings:**
   - Eva has saved $20.00.

2. **Anthony's Savings:**
   - Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
   - Therefore, Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
   - Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

3. **Roy's Savings:**
   - Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.
   - To find 40% of Anthony's savings: 40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00
   - Therefore, Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
   - Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Finally, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance \( D \) is the same for all animals.
   - The speed of one kangaroo \( S_k \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     S_k = \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle \( S_t \) is:
     \[
     S_t = \frac{S_k}{2} = \frac{D}{2 \times 18 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for one turtle to travel the distance:**
   - The time \( T_t \) it takes for one turtle to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T_t = \frac{D}{S_t} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}}} = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance:**
   - Since the distance \( D \) is the same and the turtles are traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance is the same as the time it takes for one turtle:
     \[
     T_{4t} = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 36 hours to travel across the highway.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production with the current number of cows. 

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. The farmer has 3 cows, so the total milk production is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Determine the number of dishes Peter has:**
   Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, the number of dishes Peter has is:
   \[
   \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:**
   - Total number of socks:
     \[
     \text{Total number of socks} = 30 + 60 = 90
     \]
   - Total number of dishes:
     \[
     \text{Total number of dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90
     \]
   - Total number of socks and dishes:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

The intermission takes 10 minutes, so the time available for performances and transitions is:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires:
2 minutes to get on stage
6 minutes to perform
2 minutes to exit the stage
This totals to 10 minutes per group.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for (3 years).

First, calculate the annual interest rate as a decimal:
\[ r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \]

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

Next, add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
975"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts without collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Thus, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

Thus, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Baskets:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green baskets = 3 * $25 = $75.

2. **Cost of Red Baskets:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total cost for red baskets before discount = 3 * $18 = $54.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Total discount for red baskets = 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for red baskets after discount = $54 - $6 = $48.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for all baskets = Cost of green baskets + Cost of red baskets after discount.
   - Total cost = $75 + $48 = $123.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many rooms are in one-half of the KozyInn Motel's total rooms. 

The total number of rooms is 90. One-half of 90 rooms is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. Therefore, the total time in minutes to clean 45 rooms is:
\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem year by year.

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, they will build \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \( 12 + 36 = 48 \). Doubling this amount gives \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \) homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year to find the total number of homes built over the three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

Thus, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the brackets:

\[ 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \]

Now, substitute this back into the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Volume of Water**: The initial volume of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Volume After Heavy Rain**: After a day of heavy rain, the volume of water doubles. Therefore, the volume of water becomes:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Volume on the Third Day**: On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the volume of water on the third day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial 10 people infected.

- **Day 0**: 10 people are initially infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Each of the 70 people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Each of the 490 people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, after three days, the total number of people infected is 3430.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, we add the tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of tips they received together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela is:

\[ \$1520 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In one year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In one year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In one year, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's total from Wendy's total.
   - \( 36 - 6 = 30 \)

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

We know that together, they have 85 books. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

The boys sold 18 glasses of lemonade in total. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

Each of the boys, Micah and Mitchell, sold 9 glasses of lemonade.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum these costs.

1. **Hair:** Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. **Manicure:** She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure as she did on her hair. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. **Pedicure:** She spent 3/4 as much on a pedicure as she did on a manicure.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of all the services:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the cost of buying a new rope with the money she has.
3. Calculate the leftover money after purchasing the new rope.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 per meter.
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine the cost of buying a new rope.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. Sarah can buy a new rope of the same length (20 meters) with the money she has.
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate the leftover money.
Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money Sarah has.
\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sarah will have 10 dollars left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract this from her budget of $65.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.
   - Cost of one pack of chicken = $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Total cost for 6 packs of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

5. **Total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
   - Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

6. **Money left in budget:**
   - Kelly’s budget = $65.
   - Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to account for the adjustments made for her final concert. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus an additional 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the length of her usual concert as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concert plus a 15-minute encore. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Thus, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of a whirligig based on the given relationships and the speed of a whatchamacallit.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a thingamabob can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
3. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second}

"To determine the cost of one carrot, we first need to break down the total cost of Ellen's daily diet. We know the following:

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of her daily diet is $11.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( x \). Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost for the carrots is \( 2x \).

The total cost of her daily diet can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of times she mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Determine the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) represents the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 for all her work, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem does not specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9J \times 6 = 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have 1 adult bowl.
3. Each of the two children will have 1 child bowl.

First, we convert the adult bowls to child bowls to make the calculations easier:
- 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.
- Therefore, 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child bowls.

Now, let's calculate the total number of child bowls used for dinner:
- Calvin and his wife will use 2 adult bowls, which is equivalent to 4 child bowls.
- The two children will use 2 child bowls.

Total child bowls used for dinner:
\[ 4 \text{ (adult bowls)} + 2 \text{ (child bowls)} = 6 \text{ child bowls} \]

The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the number of child bowls left is:
\[ 8 \text{ (total child bowls)} - 6 \text{ (used child bowls)} = 2 \text{ child bowls} \]

Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will be able to have:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 1 \text{ bowl per child} \]

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup 1 time.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

   - Total pieces of bologna for red balloons = \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) pieces.

3. **Determine the remaining pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - Total pieces of bologna thrown = 58 pieces.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 40 pieces.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons = \( 58 - 40 = 18 \) pieces.

4. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Total pieces of bologna for yellow balloons = \( 3y \).
   - We know \( 3y = 18 \).

5. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - \( y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in that month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals fit into 3000 miles, as the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he worked on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
- Tuesday: 5 hours
- Wednesday: 10 hours
- Thursday: 8 hours

Total hours worked = \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons. 
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and John as follows:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( A \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be John's age.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than John:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( A \) and \( P \):
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

- Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60.
- Total cost after discount = $150 - $60 = $90.

Step 3: Calculate the amount he recovers from selling 5 of the CDs.
- He sells each of the 5 CDs for $40.
- Total recovery = 5 CDs * $40/CD = $200.

Step 4: Subtract the amount recovered from the total cost after the discount.
- Net amount out = Total cost after discount - Total recovery = $90 - $200 = -$110.

Since the result is negative, it indicates that James actually made a profit of $110. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this case is $0 because he did not lose any money; he gained money.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we need to multiply the number of each type of crop by its respective price and then sum the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.0

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.0

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.0

Now, we add the earnings from each type of crop:
$9.0 + $20.0 + $5.0 = $34.0

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.0 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time for the initial swim: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swim time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time for the remaining swim:**
   - Time for the remaining swim: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Initial swim time: 6 hours.
   - Rest time: 3 hours.
   - Remaining swim time: 8 hours.
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday, which is 70. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. 

First, we calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from this total to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - Total commission from 6 copies = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - Total commission from 10 copies = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Therefore, Leo’s age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\).

So, Leo is 42 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two more equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the expressions for \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

First, we calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply by the thickness of the book in inches:

\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Pages per inch} \times \text{Thickness in inches} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \times 1.5 \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contains 2 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

1. Calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

2. Determine Vince's stapling rate:
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   - Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   - Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Thus, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on the bed:**

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. If Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, then the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has initially:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons remaining} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds initially = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks**: 
   - Initial occupied beds + beds occupied by new admissions = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks**:
   - Total capacity - total occupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert by adjusting for this overstatement. 

First, we need to find what 100% (the actual number) would be if 48 represents 120% (100% + 20% overstatement).

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. According to the problem, 120% of \( x \) is 48. This can be written as:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:

   - Holes dug: 13

3. **Third Day:**
   - Holes dug: 8
   - Holes filled: 2
   - Net holes added: 8 - 2 = 6

4. **Total holes by the end of the third day:**
   - Total holes = 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29

5. **Fourth Day:**
   - The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.
   - Holes at the end of the first day: 10
   - Holes at the end of the fourth day: 4 * 10 = 40

6. **Holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Holes at the end of the fourth day - Holes at the end of the third day = 40 - 29 = 11

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of Pokémon each person has caught with variables:
- Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation. First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[
A + S + W = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Thus, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is:
\[
\boxed{147}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine his dad's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

3. **Determine his dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

4. **Determine his brother's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Therefore, his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

5. **Determine his brother's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now:**
   - Dad's current age: 43 years
   - Brother's current age: 7 years

"To determine how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we first need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days.

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space each plant, including the space between plants, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the 111-foot flower bed:**
   - The total number of plants that can fit is the length of the flower bed divided by the space each plant and the space between plants occupy.
   - \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \( 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Thus, they can plant 3 roses.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for the adults and the kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is 6, with 2 slices for the adults and 4 slices for the kids. Therefore, the total watermelon can be represented as:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 equal parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Matteo's time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Shandy's time: 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
- Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
- Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank each day and then determine how much more is needed to fill the tank.

1. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount needed for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**

Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the required amount.**

Janet needs to save $2000, and she earns $1000 per week.
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

1. **Cost of peaches**: 3 peaches at $0.50 each
   \[ 3 \times 0.50 = 1.50 \]

2. **Cost of pears**: 4 pears at $0.50 each
   \[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2.00 \]

3. **Cost of kiwis**: 2 kiwis at $1.00 each
   \[ 2 \times 1.00 = 2.00 \]

4. **Cost of apples**: 5 apples at $0.75 each
   \[ 5 \times 0.75 = 3.75 \]

Next, we add up the total cost of these fruits:
\[ 1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25 \]

Jamaar has $10.00, so the remaining amount he has after these purchases is:
\[ 10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75 \]

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75:
\[ 0.75 \div 0.25 = 3 \]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine the rate at which he reads and then apply that rate to the total number of pages he reads.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. This means his reading rate is:
\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. Using the reading rate, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Reading rate}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} \]

Solving for time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18}{0.3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.
   - Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the relationships:**
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \( S = 2L \).
   - The total earnings from the sales are $120.

3. **Write the equation for total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from small stuffed animals: \( 4S \).
   - The total earnings from large stuffed animals: \( 12L \).
   - The total earnings equation: \( 4S + 12L = 120 \).

4. **Substitute \( S = 2L \) into the total earnings equation:**
   - \( 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \).
   - Simplify: \( 8L + 12L = 120 \).
   - Combine like terms: \( 20L = 120 \).

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \).

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the pricing pattern based on the given information. The first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6. 

We can see that the price per sandwich is consistent across the first two packages:
- For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
- For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich should remain the same for the third package. Therefore, the cost for 8 sandwiches would be:
- 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two sub-scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
       - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
       - Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
     - Total probability = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her total earnings from the jury duty.**
Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days.
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate her total expenses.**
Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days.
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine her net pay.**
Subtract her total expenses from her total earnings.
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 5: Calculate her net pay per hour.**
Divide her net pay by the total number of hours she worked.
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Thus, Melissa's net pay per hour after expenses is:

"To determine how much Ted spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, the cost of the books:
- Ted buys 3 books, each costing $16.
- Total cost for books = 3 books * $16/book = $48.

Next, the cost of the pencils:
- Ted buys 3 pencils, each costing $6.
- Total cost for pencils = 3 pencils * $6/pencil = $18.

Now, we add the total costs of the books and pencils to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = $48 (books) + $18 (pencils) = $66.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of $66.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Determine the time to move between bottles:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move between 7 intervals (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

3. **Calculate the total time to move between all bottles:**
   - Time to move between 7 intervals = 7 intervals * 5 seconds per interval = 35 seconds.

4. **Add the time to drop the candy in the first bottle:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to drop the candy in the first bottle before moving to the next.
   - Time to drop the candy in the first bottle = 0 seconds (since he starts there).

5. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to move between bottles + Time to drop candy in the first bottle
   - Total time = 35 seconds + 0 seconds = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To determine how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has.
2. Determine how many packs can be made with the total number of apples.

First, we know that each box contains 40 apples and Uncle Franky ordered 2 boxes. Therefore, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 apples each can be made from 80 apples. This is done by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he lost by not working, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost while in school:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs pieces that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, we calculate the new dimensions:
- Length of each piece: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width of each piece: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
- Area of one piece = Length × Width = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
- Total area needed = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Adding 17 to this: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Adding 5 to this: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, we sum the letters delivered over the three days:
- Monday: 425
- Tuesday: 102
- Wednesday: 209

Total letters delivered: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - He won $1 more than this: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Net change: +$11

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - Loss in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   - Net change: -$16.5

Now, let's calculate the total net change for the day:
- First race: -$5
- Second race: +$11
- Third race: -$16.5

Total net change: \(-5 + 11 - 16.5 = -10.5\)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net change by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average loss: \(\frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5\)

Thus, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.50 per race.

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their summer growth, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for consistency.

1. Convert Xavier's initial height from feet to inches:
   - Xavier was 4 feet tall.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches.
   - Therefore, 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

2. Add the growth to Xavier's initial height:
   - Xavier grew 3 inches.
   - Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

3. Cole's initial height was already given in inches:
   - Cole was 50 inches tall.

4. Add the growth to Cole's initial height:
   - Cole grew 2 inches.
   - Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

5. Calculate the difference between Cole and Xavier’s new heights:
   - Difference = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height
   - Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

"To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter.

First, calculate the total number of days worked:
- 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Next, determine the fraction of a day worked each day:
- Each day, the team worked 3/8 of a day.

Convert the fraction of a day to hours:
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 3/8 of a day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Calculate the total hours worked by the team:
- Total hours = 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours

Finally, divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:
- Each painter worked = 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, which means each year the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ V = P \times (1 - r)^n \]
where:
- \( V \) is the value after \( n \) years,
- \( P \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( n = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ V = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ V \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - There were 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the times spent by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten and the number of pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team.

First, let's calculate for the glee club:
- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them.
- Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.
- Number of pizzas left by the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas.

Next, let's calculate for the football team:
- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.
- They ate 80% of them.
- Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.
- Number of pizzas left by the football team = 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas.

Finally, we add the pizzas left by both groups:
- Total pizzas left = 6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14 pizzas.

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then sum these costs.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost of mailing all the coupons is the sum of the costs for the small and big coupons:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[
245

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser and then calculate the total amount of fertiliser they delivered.

1. **Total number of trucks dispatched**: 20 trucks
2. **Number of trucks with mechanical failures**: A quarter of the trucks dispatched had mechanical failures. 
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
   \]
3. **Number of trucks that successfully delivered**: 
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks that successfully delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
   \]
4. **Amount of fertiliser each truck carried**: 20 tons
5. **Total amount of fertiliser delivered**: 
   \[
   \text{Total amount of fertiliser delivered} = 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the current promotion, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - Therefore, he needs \( 6 \) pounds of butter.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""
   - This means for every 2 pounds of butter, the first pound is full price and the second pound is half price.

3. **Calculate the cost for 2 pounds of butter:**
   - The cost of 1 pound of butter is $4.00.
   - The cost of the second pound of butter is \( \frac{4.00}{2} = 2.00 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of butter is \( 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \).

4. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since 6 pounds is 3 sets of 2 pounds, we multiply the cost of 2 pounds by 3.
   - The total cost for 6 pounds of butter is \( 6.00 \times 3 = 18.00 \).

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is \( 18.00 \).

   - Kayla's 25 classmates
   - 7 girls from her dance class
   - 13 family members
   - Kayla herself (1 person)

   Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 + 1 = 46 people

2. **Determine the number of guests who will actually attend:**
   - 4 people said they could not come

   Total attending = 46 - 4 = 42 people

3. **Calculate the cost:**
   - The base fee for 20 guests is $125.
   - Each additional guest beyond the first 20 costs $6.

   Number of additional guests = 42 - 20 = 22

   Cost for additional guests = 22 * $6 = $132

   Total cost = Base fee + Cost for additional guests
   Total cost = $125 + $132 = $257

The total cost of the party is $257.

"To determine how much money Maggie and Riza have left after their expenditures, we first calculate how much each of them spent and then subtract these amounts from their initial amounts.

Maggie initially had $60. She spent a quarter of her money:
\[ \text{Maggie's expenditure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, Maggie has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also initially had $60. She spent one-third of her money:
\[ \text{Riza's expenditure} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, Riza has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Adding the remaining amounts of both Maggie and Riza:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Thus, the total amount of money they have left is:

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days), the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys each day is:
\[ \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we can find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the roses Jenny bought and then calculate the change she receives in quarters.

1. **Calculate the cost of 15 roses:**
   - The cost of a dozen (12) roses is $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 roses + 3 additional roses.
   - The cost of 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost of 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for 15 roses = $15 + $6 = $21.

2. **Determine the amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five $5 bills, so she has 5 * $5 = $25.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny receives:**
   - Change = Total money - Cost of roses = $25 - $21 = $4.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Number of quarters = $4 / $0.25 = 16.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

2. Calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for $1800. The discount is:

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break down James's journey into segments and calculate the time for each.

1. **First Segment (Home to Halfway to the Store):**
   - Distance: 2 miles (half of 4 miles)
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

2. **Second Segment (Halfway to the Store back to Home):**
   - Distance: 2 miles (same as the first segment)
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

3. **Third Segment (Home to the Store):**
   - Distance: 4 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:

"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets. According to the problem:

1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet:
   \[
   S + H = 100
   \]

2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 40
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
S = 20
\]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate was the remaining half after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex ate was the remaining half. This means that before the T-Rex ate, there were \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms of meat.

Thus, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken can from the remaining sodas.

Initially, Ellen had a case of 12 sodas, of which 3 were shaken. She took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken).

Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

So, there are now 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left, making a total of 8 sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

To express this as a percentage:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add these distances together to find the total distance between them.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \)

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \)

3. To find the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we add the distances each train has traveled:
   \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \)

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of days worked * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. According to the problem, Micah ran 3.5 times the distance that Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances run by Amber and Micah to find the total distance they both ran:

\[ \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance run by all three is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( J \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).
4. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means \( \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \).

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total population of the school. Given that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the following equation to find the total population (P):

40% of P = 240
0.40 * P = 240

To solve for P, divide both sides by 0.40:

P = 240 / 0.40
P = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240
Number of girls = 360

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and the total miles she plans to hike daily.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes 125 miles twice a day, she will hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The additional miles she needs to hike are:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

1. Calculate the total production of the first two workers:
   - Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
   - Over a 10-hour shift, each worker produces \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \) toys.
   - Therefore, the two workers together produce \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) toys.

2. Calculate the total production of the next two workers:
   - Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
   - Over a 10-hour shift, each worker produces \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \) toys.
   - Therefore, the two workers together produce \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) toys.

3. Calculate the total production of the four workers:
   - The total production from the four workers is \( 120 + 80 = 200 \) toys.

4. Determine the total number of toys produced by all five workers:
   - The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys.
   - Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all five workers is \( 400 - 20 = 380 \) toys.

5. Calculate the production of the fifth worker:
   - The fifth worker's production is the total production minus the production of the four workers.
   - The fifth worker produces \( 380 - 200 = 180 \) toys over the 10-hour shift.

6. Determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker:
   - The fifth worker produces 180 toys in 10 hours.
   - Therefore, the fifth worker produces \( \frac{180}{10} = 18 \) toys per hour.

The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means that two years ago, Vince was 7 years old.
6. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9
   \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

6. **Total Eggs Painted by All:**
   - The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.
   - Therefore, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).

7. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - \( 2A = 26 \)
   - \( A = 13 \)

8. **Eggs Painted by Arnold:**
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.

9. **Difference in Eggs Painted by Camden and Arnold:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

So, Grandma's speed on the beach is 1 mile per 20 minutes.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using her speed on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved. Jane has saved $4 every week for the past 8 weeks. 

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane has already saved $32. To find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take for her to save the additional $28, given that she saves $4 each week:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob initially has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob initially has. According to the problem:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of these marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

   - Therefore, Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot = 6 feet.

4. **Length of Carl's Cane:**
   - Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
   - Therefore, the length of Carl's cane = 6 feet / 2 = 3 feet.

Thus, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy needs, 5 bottles are required (since 100% / 20% = 5 bottles).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

2. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Thus, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color:**
   - Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
   - 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
   - 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

2. **Determine the number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - All 2 blue-wearers also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers also wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearers.

3. **Calculate the total number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - Total octuplets wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 octuplets.

4. **Determine the number of octuplets wearing both a bow and purple:**
   - 2 purple-wearers also wear bows.

5. **Calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - Probability = (Number of purple-wearers with bows) / (Total number of bow-wearers)
   - Probability = \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)

6. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - Percentage = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \)

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to break down the sales step by step.

1. **Initial Land Area:**
   Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

2. **First Sale:**
   He sold half of the land for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - After this sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.

3. **Second Sale:**
   He sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30.
   - 1/4 of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - After this sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.

4. **Third Sale:**
   He sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The total amount from this sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

5. **Total Earnings:**
   - From the first sale: $50
   - From the second sale: $30
   - From the third sale: $90

   Adding these amounts together gives:

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes each have 200 apartments. Combined, they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ additional apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**

Adding the apartments from all three complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections per week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ times per week} = 3120 \text{ collections per week} \]

**Step 4: Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate.**

John gets paid $0.40 per collection:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. First, we need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces.
5. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}

"Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as \( R \), \( B \), and \( Y \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, substitute \( B = 5 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts of money:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount given to their little sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money Ronnie has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, we calculate the amount of yellow paint:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is:
  \[

  \]

Next, we determine the amount of paint used for the other three colors (red, white, and purple):
- The remaining half of the mural is 6 pints, which is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
- Therefore, the amount of paint for each of these colors is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

First, calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Total cheese slices consumed = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Next, calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Total pepperoni slices consumed = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Finally, add the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas needed:
- Total pizzas needed = 3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs**: Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour.
2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

Therefore, the net rate of snowball accumulation per hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Now, we need to determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs at this net rate:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \( x - 38 \) bandages left.
   - After ordering one bulk pack, they had \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \( x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 \) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \( x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 \) bandages left.
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - Therefore, \( x + 59 = 78 \).

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - \( x + 59 = 78 \)
   - \( x = 78 - 59 \)
   - \( x = 19 \)

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut based on the length of hair removed and add the cost of the hair color.

1. **Cost of the hair color**: The cost for the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. **Cost of the haircut**: The haircut costs $30 per inch of hair cut. May's hair was reduced from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of hair cut off is:
   \[
   10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]
   The cost for the haircut is:
   \[
   2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost**: Add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
   \[
   40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of May's cut and color is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, calculate her weekly earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, which totals:
  7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
- Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
  45 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $67.5/week

Next, calculate her monthly earnings from her hourly wage:
- There are 4 weeks in April, so her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
  $67.5/week * 4 weeks = $270

Additionally, Jen receives a $10 attendance bonus for each week she has complete attendance. Since she did not incur any absences for the entire month:
- Her total attendance bonus for the month is:
  $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Finally, add her monthly earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus:
- Total earnings for April = $270 + $40 = $310

   - Total diaper changes per day = 5 changes/child/day * 2 children = 10 changes/day.

2. Next, determine how many of these diaper changes Jordan's wife handles:
   - Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - Half of 10 changes/day = 10 changes/day / 2 = 5 changes/day.

3. Finally, calculate how many diaper changes Jordan is responsible for:
   - Total changes per day = 10 changes/day.
   - Changes by Jordan's wife = 5 changes/day.
   - Changes by Jordan = 10 changes/day - 5 changes/day = 5 changes/day.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
- Base area = 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches
- Height = 15 inches

Volume of the jar = Base area * Height = 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
Total number of jelly beans = Effective volume / Volume per jelly bean = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
Difference = |900 - 864| = 36

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Initial Cost and Visits:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The initial cost per visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years initially.

   The total cost for the first 5 years is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 5 years} = 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} \times \$2/\text{visit} = 3 \times 5 \times 2 = \$30
   \]

2. **Cost After Price Increase:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the new cost is 250% of the original cost.
   - The new cost per visit is:
   \[
   \text{New cost per visit} = \$2 \times 2.5 = \$5
   \]
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.

   The total cost for the next 3 years is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 3 years} = 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} \times \$5/\text{visit} = 3 \times 3 \times 5 = \$45
   \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$30 + \$45 = \$75
   \]

Thus, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds required for 80 meatballs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

   - Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
   - There are 3 German Shepherds, so the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
     \[
     3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/day} = 15 \text{ kg/day}
     \]
   - Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
   - There are 2 Bulldogs, so the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
     \[
     2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/day} = 6 \text{ kg/day}
     \]

2. **Total Daily Consumption:**
   - The total daily consumption for all the dogs is:
     \[
     15 \text{ kg/day (German Shepherds)} + 6 \text{ kg/day (Bulldogs)} = 21 \text{ kg/day}
     \]

3. **Weekly Consumption:**
   - To find the total consumption for a week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
     \[

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. John invited 20 people, and each will eat 2 hot dogs:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/person} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so the additional number of hot dogs he needs is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend:

\[ 12 \]

   - Since James is 18 years old, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Thus, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"To determine the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

1. **Cost of the radiator:**
   - Original price: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: 80% of $400 = 0.80 * $400 = $320
   - Price after discount: $400 - $320 = $80

2. **Cost of the mechanic's labor:**
   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: 3 * $50 = $150

3. **Total cost:**
   - Cost of the radiator: $80
   - Cost of the mechanic's labor: $150
   - Total: $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
