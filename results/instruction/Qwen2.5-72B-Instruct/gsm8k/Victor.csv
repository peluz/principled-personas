"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]

2. Calculate the new value of the house:
   \[
   \text{New value} = \text{Original value} + \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including repairs:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Original purchase price} + \text{Cost of repairs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

4. Calculate the profit:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
   \]

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total feed needed per day is:
   \[
   20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
   \[
   15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   The total feed needed for the day is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given. Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
   \[
   60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Journey:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return journey is 4 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered = 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Journey:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost:
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After selling at the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
6. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so the remaining vacuum cleaners can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
7. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and cheerleading coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Now, let's calculate her earnings from cheerleading coaching:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year

Now, we add the two amounts to get her total annual salary.

Total annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching

Let's do the math:

Earnings from teaching = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Earnings from coaching = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Taken} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum these amounts after accounting for the spill.

First, let's determine the amount of water in the orange drink:
- The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
- \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the amounts of water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Total water = 6 liters (from the orange drink) + 9 liters (from the pineapple drink) = 15 liters.

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is 15 liters.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount. If \( P \) is the original price, then the price Kyle paid is 75% of \( P \) (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

The equation is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples:

- Chicken meal: $12
- 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
- 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total cost of these items:

Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:

Amount spent on pizza = Total paid - Total cost of other items = $50 - $33 = $17

Now, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she ordered:

Number of pizza boxes = Amount spent on pizza / Cost per box = $17 / $8.50 = 2

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. Let's denote Darrell's age by \(7x\) and Allen's age by \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solve for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine what each friend guessed and then calculate the average of those guesses.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

\[ G = S + 30 \]

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

Now, we add the points from both periods to find the total:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Total points scored: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. After selling them, he uses the money to buy video games and has $5 left. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine if he sold all of them or not.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games he buys:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he had before buying the games is:
$160 (cost of games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

Since John made $195 from selling his lego sets and he only used $165, we can determine if he sold all his lego sets by comparing these amounts. If he used less than $195, it means he did not sell all his lego sets.

However, since the total amount he made from selling the lego sets ($195) is more than the amount he used ($165), it indicates that he did sell all his lego sets and had some money left over, which he still has as $5.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
0

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time spent running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week. To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on the information given about her skipping speed.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running: \( 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking: \( 1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \).

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance: \( 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone: 400 feet.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone: 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet.
3. The dragon's flame reach is 1000 feet.
4. The distance outside the dragon's flame reach where Polly can still hit the dragon is the difference between the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone and the dragon's flame reach: 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet.

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we first need to calculate the total number of pie pieces Grandma Jones initially had. Since she baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

40 pieces - 14 pieces remaining = 26 pieces taken

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. The nutritional information states that there are 250 calories per serving, and the 300g bag has 5 servings. Therefore, each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since each serving is 250 calories, we can calculate the number of grams per calorie:

60g / 250 calories = 0.24g per calorie

Now, we can determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories:

200 calories * 0.24g per calorie = 48g

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue from selling the candles and subtract his total costs for the beeswax and wicks.

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax.
   - He wants to make 20 candles.
   - Number of pounds of beeswax needed = 20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total cost of beeswax and wicks:**
   - Cost per pound of beeswax and wicks = $10.00.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Selling price per candle = $2.00.
   - Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $20.00.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she originally had from the total to find out how many were in the package.

Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using 220, so the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:

220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243 (total before using)

Candice originally had 80 Post-it notes in her purse, so the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

243 (total before using) - 80 (originally had) = 163 (in the package)

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity is:

5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to find out the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

First, we calculate the fuel efficiency of her car. Since she traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons to refill the tank, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Gallons Used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we use this fuel efficiency to find out how far she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank Capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of money she received over the 8 weeks from her final total.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has $100. This total includes her initial amount plus the $40 she received over the 8 weeks. To find her initial amount, we subtract the $40 from the final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60.

"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students Judy teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money Judy makes by multiplying the total number of students by the charge per student.

First, let's find the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Next, we calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, that's 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money Judy makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, that's 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

Therefore, Judy makes $7,425.00 in one week.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

\[ \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{42 \text{ miles} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ x = \frac{420 \text{ minutes}}{3} \]
\[ x = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Poppy starts with a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.
2. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{4} = 250
   \]
   So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

3. After Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

4. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. A third of 750 is:
   \[
   \frac{750}{3} = 250
   \]
   So, her mom places 250 pieces.

5. After her mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * 3
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and then solve for the unknown.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \(x\) 30-minute episodes, which is \(0.5x\) hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV over the week is 7 hours. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, let's break down the information given:

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5.
2. This means before dropping the cookies, he had \(110 + 5 = 115\) cookies.
3. He baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the number of cookies he intended to bake is \(115 - 15 = 100\).
4. He intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, so the number of cookies he baked last year is \(100 / 2 = 50\).

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Lylah's new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary.

1. Monthly cost = Number of car washes per month * Cost per car wash
   Monthly cost = 4 car washes * $15
   Monthly cost = $60

2. Annual cost = Monthly cost * Number of months in a year
   Annual cost = $60 * 12
   Annual cost = $720

So, Tom pays $720 for car washes in a year.

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in the time he had for each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- The test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35\).

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- The test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70\).

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Total incomplete questions = \(35 + 70 = 105\).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first identify which items are nonfood and then apply the 10% tax to those items. Milk and eggs are food items, so they are not taxed. The nonfood items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The cost of the food items is:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total for food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total for nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

The tax on the nonfood items is 10% of $10, which is:
$10 * 0.10 = $1

The total cost of the nonfood items after tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

The total cost for everything is the sum of the food items and the taxed nonfood items:
$5 + $11 = $16

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares.

First, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Next, calculate the number of pineapples harvested per hectare per year:
100 pineapples/hectare/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 400 pineapples/hectare/year

Now, multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees at each stage:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. This includes the 30 bees that left initially and the 60 bees that left later, minus the 15 bees that had already returned.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \]

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar).

500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to find the original number of fries in the pack.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before the ants**: The ants carried off 1 fry, so before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Before the raccoon**: The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, meaning one-third of the fries were left. If one-third of the fries is 6, then the total number of fries before the raccoon took any is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
4. **Before the pigeons**: The three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. Before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Before the seagull**: The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. Before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. **Initial state**: Dave ate 14 fries, so before he ate any, the pack contained \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

Thus, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total class hours for the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total length of all baked goods:**
   - Add the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes: \( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back-and-forth run is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).

\[ \text{Blake's total distance} = 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each way, or 160 yards for a round trip. She does this 34 times.

\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 200 + (34 \times 160) \]
\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 200 + 5440 = 5640 \text{ yards} \]

**Difference in Distance:**
To find out how much farther Kelly runs than Blake, we subtract Blake's total distance from Kelly's total distance.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

"To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then increase it by 50%.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate the 50% increase on the total minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

3. Calculate the total monthly payment with the 50% increase:
   Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

4. Calculate the total annual payment:
   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total revenue and then their total costs, including the cost of lemons.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let's denote the total revenue as \( R \) and the total cost as \( C \).
   - The profit formula is: \( \text{Profit} = R - C \).
   - Given the profit is $25, we have: \( 25 = R - C \).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, totaling $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total cost \( C \) is then \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - The revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - The total revenue \( R \) is then \( 10G \).

4. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( R \) and \( C \) into the profit equation: \( 25 = 10G - 5G \).
   - Simplify: \( 25 = 5G \).
   - Solve for \( G \): \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is $15.

"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount after the donation.
6. The final amount will be the remaining money after all these expenses and donations.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount after Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount after Donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount after Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Expenses for Daughter and Wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total Given to Family} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final Remaining Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Final Remaining Amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- His earnings for the first week are 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- His earnings for the second week are 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, let's find out how old Jan was two years ago:
- Jan's current age = 30
- Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28

Next, we use the information that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time:
- Half of Jan's age two years ago = 28 / 2 = 14
- Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5 = 19

Now, we need to find Mark's current age:
- Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21

Finally, we use the information that Jean is two years older than Mark:
- Jean's current age = 21 + 2 = 23

So, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     2 \times 100 = 200\%
     \]

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.
2. The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
3. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
4. 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits:

- Hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw.
- Rabbits: 20 pieces of straw.

So, the total straw used for hamsters and rabbits is:
50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70 pieces of straw.

Subtract this from the total straw to find out how much straw is used for the rats:
160 (total) - 70 (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the number of rats can be calculated as:
90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is:
15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, but since the interest is compounded monthly and the period is only 3 months, we can calculate it step by step.

The formula for the amount after one month is:
\[ A = P(1 + r) \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after one month,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate.

For the first month:
\[ A_1 = 100(1 + 0.02) = 100 \times 1.02 = 102 \]

For the second month:
\[ A_2 = 102(1 + 0.02) = 102 \times 1.02 = 104.04 \]

For the third month:
\[ A_3 = 104.04(1 + 0.02) = 104.04 \times 1.02 = 106.12 \]

Therefore, after 3 months, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost per bag to the trader**: The trader buys each bag for $20 and it costs $2 to transport each bag. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
   \[
   20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars per bag}
   \]

2. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.

3. **Profit per bag**: The profit made on each bag is the selling price minus the total cost:
   \[
   30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars per bag}
   \]

4. **Total profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400. To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{400}{8} = 50

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: $20.25 for 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend pays:
$102 / 3 = $34

Each friend paid $34.

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and then calculate the earnings from each publisher.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives us Mark's total weekly earnings:

2. **Omelets for breakfast**: He ate omelets 3 days, using 1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\)

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner**: He used 8 slices of cheese in one big dish.
   - Total cheese for macaroni and cheese: \(8 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
- Total cheese used: \(14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices}\)

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:

"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to add the number of green and yellow pens she originally had to the total number of blue and red pens she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens:
6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens:
2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add all the pens together:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

So, Janet has 98 pens now.

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93:
- The formula for the average is: (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)
- We want the average of the five highest scores to be 93.
- Therefore, the total score needed for the five highest scores is: 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we need to find the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
- Scores (excluding the lowest score of 71): 89, 92, 100, 86
- Sum of these scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. The sum of the five highest scores (including the sixth test score) should be 465:
- 367 + \( x \) = 465
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 465 - 367 = 98
  \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we can break the problem into two parts: the distance he rode in the first four weeks and the distance he rode in the following three weeks.

1. For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides \(125 \times 4 = 500\) kilometers.

2. For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides \(120 \times 3 = 360\) kilometers.

Adding the distances from both periods gives us the total distance:
- Total distance = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40 grams/chocolate bar = 1000 grams

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs:
40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20 grams/candied apple = 1600 grams

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000 grams (chocolate bars) + 1600 grams (candied apples) = 2600 grams

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought after all three days, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we add up the cakes bought on each day to find the total:

- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes bought = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost for 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
   - Cost per cup = $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, the remaining amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs produced by the red and white chickens is 42:
   \[
   3R + 5W = 42
   \]

2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens:
   \[
   W = R + 2
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

\[
3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
\]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8R + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8R = 32
\]
\[
R = 4
\]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter for \( d \) and Gary's walking speed for \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( x \).

The total number of customers over the three days can be expressed as:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

   - Interest: 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200
   - Total amount to be repaid: $2000 + $200 = $2200

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Total payments over 12 months: $165 * 12 = $1980

3. Determine the remaining balance after 12 months:
   - Total amount owed: $2200
   - Total amount paid: $1980
   - Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's current age.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is twice Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

1. The total points scored by the four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, calculate how many points Yuri scored:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, calculate how many points Brianna scored:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points scored by the three: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)
- Points scored by Jojo: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes her 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes her 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = Time spent on crossword puzzles + Time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water to water her garden. The amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}

3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater collected:
   \[
   30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pen pals Mike is currently writing to:
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped writing to 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he is now writing to \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. Determine the number of letters Mike receives each week:
   - Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.

3. Calculate the total number of pages Mike receives each week:
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages a week.

4. Determine the number of pages Mike writes in response:
   - Mike responds in kind, so he writes 30 pages a week.

5. Calculate the time Mike spends writing each week:
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin now has:
   \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is:
   \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   So, Griffin now has:
   \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is:
   \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   So, Griffin now has:
   \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) fries.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \( x \). Therefore:
   \( 7 + x = 27 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 27 - 7 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information and setting up the equations based on the given conditions.

1. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
3. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \( f \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Step 1: Daily cost
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours each day.
Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500

Step 2: Weekly cost
The makeup is needed 4 times a week.
Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days/week = $6000

Step 3: Total cost for 5 weeks
Total cost = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000

Step 4: Apply the 10% discount
Discount = 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000
Total cost after discount = $30000 - $3000 = $27000

Jean paid $27000."

"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys any additional cows. There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows, so the total number of cows initially is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows per stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, each stall will have the original 20 cows plus the 2 new cows:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. 

\[ \text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 \times 400 \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate, which is 30% of the total weight.

\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten} = 0.30 \times 8000 \]
\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight of the tree.

\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 8000 - 2400 \]
\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the amount needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:**
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies:

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house.
2. Add the additional windows in one house.
3. Multiply the total number of windows in one house by the number of houses.

Step 1: Number of windows in the bedrooms of one house:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Step 2: Add the additional windows in one house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in one house is \(6 + 4 = 10\).

Step 3: Multiply the total number of windows in one house by the number of houses:
- John has 2 houses.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in both houses is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

"To find out how much change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. The total cost is the sum of the prices of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

The price of cocoa is $4.20, the price of laundry is $9.45, and the price of pasta is $1.35. Adding these together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with a $20 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body, which is \(900 / 10 = 90\) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[ 630 \text{ stitches} / 2 = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of seed and then add them together.

For the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets.
- Each packet costs $40.
- The total cost for tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.

For the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets.
- Each packet costs $30.
- The total cost for celery seeds is 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400.

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost = Cost of tomato seeds + Cost of celery seeds
- Total cost = $800 + $2400
- Total cost = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, let's break down the information given:

1. **Solo Song**: The song has 54 lines, and all of these lines are his.
2. **First Scene**: The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines.
3. **Second Scene**: The second scene has six more lines than the song, which is \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has before buying the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, and each dime is worth 10 cents.

The total value of the quarters is:
5 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 125 cents

The total value of the dimes is:
2 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 20 cents

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Now, let's subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has.

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, which gives us:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, which gives us:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together, we have:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and the result is a whole number, exactly 3 trucks are needed to transport all 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To determine how much Susan earns, we first need to calculate the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Converting this to minutes, we have:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Since she takes a half-hour pause, the actual working time is:
180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval:
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

   - Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours per week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week
   - Earnings from hourly wage per week = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

2. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Weekly bonus = $300
   - Total weekly earnings = $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week

3. **Calculate the total earnings for April:**
   - April typically has 4 weeks.
   - Total earnings for April = 4 weeks * $800/week = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total loaves produced each day**: 60 loaves.
2. **Loaves sold in the morning**: Two-thirds of the total loaves.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. **Loaves remaining after the morning sales**:
   \[
   \text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. **Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening**: Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. **Loaves sold in the afternoon**:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is 5.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the savings on the ice cream and the milk separately and then add them together.

For the ice cream:
- Original price per tub: $13
- New price per tub: $11
- Savings per tub: $13 - $11 = $2
- Total savings for 2 tubs: 2 * $2 = $4

For the milk:
- Discount per packet: $0.5
- Total savings for 4 packets: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Total savings for both items:
- Total savings: $4 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $6

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over a period of fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **New Arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ new arms}
     \]

2. **New Legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ new legs}
     \]

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ new arms} + 3 \text{ new legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes are required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total amount by which the coffee is weakened.

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - For 5 ice cubes, the total weakening is:

"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial total cost of the shares.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year's increase.
3. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year's decrease.

**Step 1: Initial total cost of the shares**
Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
Initial cost = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

**Step 2: Value after the first year's increase**
The stock price increases by 50%.
Increase = 50% of $8 = 0.50 * $8 = $4
New price per share = $8 + $4 = $12
Value after first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

**Step 3: Value after the second year's decrease**
The stock price decreases by 25%.
Decrease = 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New price per share = $12 - $3 = $9
Value after second year = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, therefore, has \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the equal groups, has:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( H = 2C \) (twice as many chickens as cows)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals based on the information provided:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself, we add the weights together:

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Mary has 30 sheep in total.
2. Half of the sheep (30 / 2 = 15) give 1 kg of milk each day.
3. The other half (also 15 sheep) give 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, calculate the total milk from each group:
- From the first group (15 sheep): 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg
- From the second group (15 sheep): 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Adding the milk from both groups gives the total daily milk collection:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then the total amount to be repaid. After that, we can divide the total repayment amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. Since Karan borrowed the money for five months, we need to calculate the interest for this period.

   \[
   \text{Annual interest rate} = 10\% = 0.10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest for 5 months} = \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \times 0.10 \times 3650
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest for 5 months} = \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \times 365
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest for 5 months} = 152.0833
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total repayment} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total repayment} = 3650 + 152.0833
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total repayment} = 3802.0833
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
3. Calculate the total profit by subtracting the cost of supplies from the total revenue.
4. Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.
5. Calculate the profit per hour.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade.**

Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.**

Each cup is sold for $1:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar/cup} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total profit.**

The cost of supplies is $18:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost of supplies} \]
\[ \text{Total profit} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 18 \text{ dollars} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.**

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total number of cups}}{\text{Cups sold per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit per hour.**

\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Total time}} \]
\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{18 \text{ dollars}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold 3/5 of his land, then he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land equals 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first. Then, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26 girls

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. However, half of these girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls who can make it = 26 / 2 = 13 girls

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 13 + 3 = 16

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts (or 0.9 kilowatts) per hour.
   - Originally, it is used for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 0.9 kW * 8 hours = 7.2 kWh.

2. Calculate the reduced daily energy consumption:
   - If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours.
   - Reduced daily energy consumption = 0.9 kW * 3 hours = 2.7 kWh.

3. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = Original daily consumption - Reduced daily consumption
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

4. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = Daily energy savings * 30 days

Additionally, he took 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend. This brings the total number of steps he has taken so far to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before the jog, he had 2,000 steps left plus the steps he took during the jog. Since he had 4,000 steps left before the jog (10,000 - 6,000), and he only has 2,000 steps left after the jog, he must have taken 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we'll determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs to account for the 10 minutes it takes to get to the airport, so the total time he needs to allocate for reading and traveling is:

30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, we can calculate how many minutes early he will be:

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments for May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month for simplicity)

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees who continued working in June:
\[ 40 \, \text{employees} \times \frac{3}{4} = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 4: Sum the payments for May and June.**

Total payment for May and June:
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - She bought 4 magnets, so the total cost is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of Purchases:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - She spent $7.00.
   - Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

1. Calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
   - The first package costs $400.
   - The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

2. Add the costs of the two packages:
   - Total cost of the two packages = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
   - The discount amount = 20% of $1200 = 0.20 * $1200 = $240.
   - The cost after the discount = $1200 - $240 = $960.

4. Add the cost of the finale firework:
   - The finale firework costs $150.
   - Total cost = $960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. 

First, we know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are expected to explode. 

1. Calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:
\[ \text{Number of exploding candles} = 50000 \times 0.01 = 500 \]

Next, we are told that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. Calculate the number of exploding candles that also smell like wet dog:
\[ \text{Number of exploding and smelling candles} = 500 \times 0.05 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is:

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

1. Calculate the discount per blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is 30% of $20.
   - \( 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price per blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost is the discounted price per blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
   - \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) dollars.

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \)
   - Total for the next 2 days: 240 km

3. **Next 1 day**: He wasn't traveling at all.
   - Total for this day: 0 km

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, we sum all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \)

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can calculate the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find the size of Timothy's locker, we multiply Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

2. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
3. His initial capital was $5000.

Adding these amounts together:

$4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) + $5000 (initial capital) = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue's current capital is $17000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.
3. After the boats have left, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats.
4. Then, \(3/5\) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\) cats.
5. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\) cats.

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   - 8 months * $12/month = $96

3. **Remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   - 2 years = 24 months
   - 24 months - 6 months (first period) - 8 months (second period) = 10 months
   - 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up the costs for all periods:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after a $4 savings, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after a $2 savings, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup:
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 25\% \times \text{Cost of bagel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over after buying the ticket, so he must have made $150 in total from selling his cards.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he made by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.
4. Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards he sold represent the remaining 2/3 of his collection.
5. To find the total number of cards he started with, we can set up the equation: 2/3 * total cards = 100 cards.
6. Solving for the total number of cards, we get: total cards = 100 cards / (2/3) = 100 * (3/2) = 150 cards.

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means:
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - These 18 guests would each get 2 hotdogs, totaling 36 hotdogs (18 guests * 2 hotdogs each).
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, totaling 18 hotdogs (18 guests * 1 hotdog each).

2. **Total Hotdogs Prepared**: Adding these together, the caterer prepared:
   - 36 hotdogs (for the 18 guests who get 2) + 18 hotdogs (for the 18 guests who get 1) = 54 hotdogs.

3. **Actual Attendance**: 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means:
   - Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs, totaling 80 hotdogs (40 guests * 2 hotdogs each).

4. **Shortage Calculation**: The caterer only had 54 hotdogs, but 80 were needed. The shortage is:
   - 80 hotdogs needed - 54 hotdogs available = 26 hotdogs short.

5. **Guests Without Second Hotdog**: Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs and there are 26 hotdogs short, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
   - 26 hotdogs short / 1 hotdog per guest = 26 guests.

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost.

The amount she pays is 80% of $165.00, which is:

   - Antoine doubles the amount of onions, so he uses 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.
   - The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of onions = 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost of beef stock:**
   - He needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - The cost of each box is $2.00.
   - Total cost of beef stock = 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the ingredients:**
   - Total cost = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per serving:**
   - The soup serves 6 people.
   - Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings = $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time. Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is:
   \[
   4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the time difference:**
   Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

4. **Calculate the total time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne:**
   Since Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes, he will arrive at the theater 4 minutes after he leaves his hotel. Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne's 4-minute travel time. This means Bernadette needs to arrive:
   \[
   4 + 5 = 9 \text{ minutes before Wayne leaves his hotel}
   \]

5. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave:**
   Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before her arrival time. To arrive 9 minutes before Wayne leaves his hotel, Bernadette should leave:
   \[
   16 + 9 = 25 \text{ minutes before Wayne leaves his hotel}
   \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 25 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads

Total beads Elizabeth bought:
20 beads (red) + 40 beads (clear) = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads

Total beads Margareth bought:
60 beads (blue) + 80 beads (red) = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to follow the relationships given in the question step by step.

1. First, convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:
   \[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:
   \[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:
   \[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes.

"First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay. Each bail costs $3.

\[ \text{Cost of hay} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the change Michael will have after buying the hay.

\[ \text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Cost of hay} \]
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is $20 for the movie and one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra, making it $21 in total.

If you buy the movie ticket for $12 and the soda for $3, and you save $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda should be $2 less than $21, which is $19.

So, the equation for the total cost without the super ticket is:
\[ 12 + \text{popcorn price} + 3 = 19 \]

Solving for the popcorn price:
\[ 15 + \text{popcorn price} = 19 \]
\[ \text{popcorn price} = 19 - 15 \]
\[ \text{popcorn price} = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

Thus, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

"To determine the cost of the potting soil for Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
For one raised bed:
\[ \text{Volume} = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds.
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Each bag costs $12.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the potting soil is:

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide this total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

Next, we determine how many trips are needed to transport 4500 pounds of feed, given that the truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time:
- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer needs exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of pencils at each stage.

1. **Initial number of pencils:**
   - There are 30 students, and each started with 10 pencils.
   - Total pencils at the start = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils used after two months:**
   - 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.
   - Pencils remaining after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

3. **Pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the combined length of the remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.

First, convert the length of one remora from inches to feet:
1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:
(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
= (1 foot / 10 feet) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, the number of kids not allergic to anything is:

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The total consumption for 5 days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags required is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Simplify the equation:

   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - We need to find the combination of 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces that maximizes the number of sticks while staying within the $24 budget.

4. **Calculate the Number of Each Type of Wood He Can Buy:**
   - With $24, Frederick can buy:
     - 2 x 4 pieces: \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces
     - 2 x 8 pieces: \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Sticks for Each Combination:**
   - If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4:
     - Total sticks: \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \)
   - If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8:
     - Total sticks: \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \)

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum number of sticks Frederick can make is by buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, which gives him 1600 sticks.

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs needed = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day for her bus trips is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of a weekly bus pass is $20.00. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ 2.00 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has \(20 / 2 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Combined, the farm and the zoo have:

40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120 animals

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to determine the quantities based on the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the amount that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

- Let \( O \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
- Let \( P \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

According to the problem:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

Solving for \( O \) and \( P \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal.
2. Calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Divide the total number of calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.**

- December 31st to January 1st: 1 day
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Adding these together: 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs.**

- 1 pound = 3500 calories
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.**

- Total calories to lose / Number of days = 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522.39 calories per day

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 522 calories.

"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of her $500 on clothes:

20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, she has:

$500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, she spends 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

So, after buying CDs, she has:

$400 - $100 = $300 left.

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

"To determine Tara's profit, we need to calculate her total cost and her total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
   - Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for the 8 packs is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   - Therefore, the profit is \(320 - 32 = 288\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially:

- Four $10 bills: \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars
- Six $20 bills: \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars

Total money Ali has: \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of $160: \(160 \div 2 = 80\) dollars

So, after giving his sister $80, Ali has:

- Remaining money: \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars

Then, Ali uses \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner:

- \( \frac{3}{5} \) of $80: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \) dollars

So, after buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:

- Remaining money after dinner: \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars

"To solve this problem, let's break down the picking rates for each person:

1. **Tony's rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby's rate**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29 \text{ quarts per hour}

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. 

The total amount Tom spent is $48. The cost of the CD is $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had an additional $44 to spend. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

The total bill, including the tip, is $60. Since you are splitting the check evenly but paying the entire tip, you pay half of the original bill plus the entire tip:
\[ \frac{50}{2} + 10 = 25 + 10 = 35 \]

Therefore, you end up paying $35.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the savings for each half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - He saves twice as much each day in the second half, so he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

6. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

8. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of April to meet his target.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and then subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:
- The cost of the apples is 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
- The cost of the oranges is 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
- The cost of the peaches is 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total cost = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $20 - $13.00
Change = $7.00

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we first calculate the total earnings for each of them based on the number of tasks they completed and the payment per task.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task. For 20 tasks, his total earnings are:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny earns $0.5 per task. For 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference in their earnings is:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply that by the number of days he works in a week.

Each day, Jeff walks to work and back, which is a total of 3 miles to work and 3 miles back. So, the total distance he walks in one day is:

3 miles (to work) + 3 miles (back home) = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is:

6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

"To solve this, let's break down Elise's writing process:

1. First, she writes the full alphabet twice. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice means she writes:
   \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes:
   \(13\) letters.

3. Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters. Rewriting all of these means she writes:
   \(65\) letters again.

Adding all these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the phone tree. Each person calls 3 new people, and this process repeats for each subsequent round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are called.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are called.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount, then apply the 10% discount to the total.

1. Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
2. Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
3. Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00
4. Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Now, we add up these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Total cost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ray's swimming time for 1 mile in warm water:**
   - When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
   - When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.
   - Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this time gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - In cold water, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - In warm water, Ray swims 1 mile in 34 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

4. **Determine the difference in time between warm and cold water for 3 miles:**
   - The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know there are 7 buttons with two holes each. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is:
7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons

These 14 buttons each have four holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is:
14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}

2. The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is already at 32 degrees from the ground, we add the 50 degrees to this initial angle:

32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

Thus, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be 82 degrees.

2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles required:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles, so we need to determine how many packs are required:
20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"To determine how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

Finally, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

"To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since there are 4 days and he spends an equal amount each day, we can find the daily spending amount by dividing the total amount of money by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures. The cost of one wooden action figure is $5, so the number of wooden action figures he buys each day is:

\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures per day} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]

Since he buys wooden action figures for 4 days, the total number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \text{Total wooden action figures} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, we calculate the amount of money he has left after buying the wooden action figures. He spends $10 each day for 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ \text{Total spent on wooden action figures} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money is:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures. He has 3 days left and still spends $10 each day, so the total amount spent on plastic action figures is:

\[ \text{Total spent on plastic action figures} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one plastic action figure is $2, so the number of plastic action figures he buys each day is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures per day} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Since he buys plastic action figures for 3 days, the total number of plastic action figures he buys is:

\[ \text{Total plastic action figures} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Finally, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:

\[ \text{Total action figures} = 8 + 15 = 23 \]

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide by the number of days.

Total birds seen:
- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:

Average number of birds per day = Total birds / Number of days
Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7
Average number of birds per day = 40

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. 

The percentage error can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. If Maggie's recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the set temperature \( T \) such that the actual temperature is 520 degrees, considering the 4% increase.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 520 = T \times (1 + 0.04) \]
\[ 520 = T \times 1.04 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ T = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes gives us:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount. The original price for 2 boxes is $200.00. With a 10% discount, the total cost is reduced by $20.00 (10% of $200.00), making the total cost $180.00.

Next, we need to determine the total number of contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes. Since each box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes will contain 180 contacts.

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \text{Cost per contact} = \frac{\$180.00}{180 \text{ contacts}} = \$1.00 \text{ per contact} \]

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the cost per pair is:
\[ \text{Cost per pair} = 2 \times \$1.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is $2.00.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue), and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

   - Therefore, the number of rotations per month is \( 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \) rotations.

3. Calculate the number of rotations per year:
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is \( 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \) rotations.

4. Determine how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum rotation capacity:
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - Therefore, the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is \( \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \) years.

The tires will need to be replaced after 6 years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, we can double the number of washes by using 1 pump per wash:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per wash. The bottle costs $24.00, and it will now last for 240 washes. The cost per wash is:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since each wash now uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is:

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42 on the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants:
   - 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter.
   - Therefore, 4 dozen croissants require \(4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1\) pound of butter.

2. Calculate the total amount of butter needed for a week (7 days):
   - If 4 dozen croissants require 1 pound of butter per day, then for 7 days, the total amount of butter needed is \(1 \times 7 = 7\) pounds.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the amounts of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the required height from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet, which is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches, we can set up the following equation:

Current height + (Growth per year * Number of years) = Required height
40 inches + (2 inches/year * Number of years) = 48 inches

We can solve for the number of years:
2 inches/year * Number of years = 48 inches - 40 inches
2 inches/year * Number of years = 8 inches
Number of years = 8 inches / 2 inches/year
Number of years = 4

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.**
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to acquire the cars.**
The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost to Acquire Each Car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost to Acquire 10 Cars} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Sales} - \text{Total Cost to Acquire} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission.**
James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{James's Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance of the gap by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per attended class over $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. The cost per class if he attends all is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per attended class will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per attended class does not exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per attended class is then:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10.

"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He buys 10 suits, so he buys 10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The total cost of everything is $10800.

"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine how much flour was in one bag. Since one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag as follows:

1 portion = 2 kilograms
8 portions = 8 * 2 kilograms = 16 kilograms

So, one bag contains 16 kilograms of flour. Now, to find out how much flour was in three bags, we multiply the amount in one bag by 3:

3 bags * 16 kilograms/bag = 48 kilograms

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
Stanley's speed = 10 miles per hour
Stanley's time = 2.5 hours
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to get the total distance:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through both the soil and the clay.

First, we calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig at half the speed through clay, which is 4 feet per hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Finally, we add the time to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time:
- Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( S = 15 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one for each dog, so he now has 12 (current) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys, which is exactly the number of dogs he has.

Therefore, James needs a total of 21 toys.

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how much Karen earns in one day. If she works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

"To determine by how much the group exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we first calculate the total weight of the group and then compare it to the maximum load.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults (including Jack):
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

2. Compare the total weight to the maximum load of the elevator:
   - Maximum load = 700 kg.
   - Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The group exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has, which we'll call \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
3. We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( C + 7 = 68 \). Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 68 - 7 = 61 \).
4. Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Max has: \( C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \) cookies.
5. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \( 73 + 23 = 96 \) cookies.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies they all have together:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Adding these together: \( 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \).

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the candies. We know that:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

The total cost of the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

This $1.20 is the total cost of the four candies. To find the cost of one candy, we divide by 4:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{4} = \$0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.

The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong. Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which means:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

Calculating the additional amount Neil saves:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together gives the combined savings:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

"To calculate the total price of the crate, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits to get the total price of the crate:

"To find the total number of square feet of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:
   \[

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs required for the function and then compare it to the number of chairs the restaurant currently has.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 \text{ (adults)} + 15 \text{ (babies)} = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs and high chairs the restaurant has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The total number of chairs is the sum of the regular chairs and the high chairs:
     \[
     40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs}
     \]

4. **Determine how many more chairs are needed:**
   - The number of additional chairs needed is the difference between the total number of chairs required and the total number of chairs the restaurant has:
     \[

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, let's break down the information given:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which means Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds.

Let's denote the amount of gravel Gary's truck can carry as \( G \).

The total capacity of the three trucks is the sum of the capacities of each truck:
\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600 \]

Now, solve for \( G \):
\[ 8,800 + G = 11,600 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second. 

To find the turtle's speed, we divide the cat's speed by 5:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money per hour. We know that they raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. 

The rate of money raised per hour is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money they need to reach their goal of $6300:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining $4200 at the rate of $700 per hour:
\[ \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Hours already fundraised} + \text{Additional hours needed} = 3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

4. Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, we add up the costs to get the total before the discount:
Total before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final total:
Total after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal:
- Erin has $6.00.
- Each scoop costs $1.50.
- Number of scoops she can buy = $6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops.

Now, let's apply the deal:
- For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free.
- With 4 scoops, she can get 2 sets of 2 scoops, which means she gets 2 free scoops.

So, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
- 4 scoops (bought) + 2 scoops (free) = 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to get a total of 6 scoops.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much candy each person has left after two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's determine how many days are in two weeks:
2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

So, Ginger has:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Now, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

So, Amy has:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left

Finally, we find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

1. **Cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Pounds bought
   Total cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost of buying = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

She dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (since she dances for a total of 5 minutes and her arms are raised for 2 of those minutes).

For the right foot:
\[ 300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps} \]

For the left foot:
\[ 250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised:
- Both feet: 200 taps per minute

She dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

For both feet:
\[ 200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps for each foot:
- Total taps for the right foot: \( 900 \text{ taps} + 400 \text{ taps} = 1300 \text{ taps} \)
- Total taps for the left foot: \( 750 \text{ taps} + 400 \text{ taps} = 1150 \text{ taps} \)

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 9x = 100 - 10 \]

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 windows = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 windows (students) + 48 windows (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To determine Mark's profit, we need to calculate his total expenses and his total revenue from selling the cards.

1. **Total Expenses:**
   - Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards.
   - Each pack costs $1800.
   - Total expenses = 3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400.

2. **Total Revenue:**
   - He gets 1 card worth $4000.
   - He gets another card worth $1000.
   - He gets 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50.
   - Revenue from the 30 cards = 30 cards * $50/card = $1500.
   - Total revenue = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total expenses

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:
- Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
- In 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.
- In two 4-week months, there are \(2 \times 20 = 40\) weekdays and \(2 \times 8 = 16\) weekend days.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- On weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. Therefore, in 40 weekdays, the total number of chairs rented is \(60 \times 40 = 2400\).
- On weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. Therefore, in 16 weekend days, the total number of chairs rented is \(100 \times 16 = 1600\).

Finally, we sum the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented = \(2400 + 1600 = 4000\).

"To find out how much each roommate, including Jenna, will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the monthly cost per person.
2. Multiply the monthly cost per person by the number of months in a year.

First, the total monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Since there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates) sharing the cost, the monthly cost per person is:

\[ \text{Monthly cost per person} = \frac{\$100}{5} = \$20 \]

Next, to find the annual cost per person, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual cost per person} = \$20 \times 12 = \$240 \]

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Inventory:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 3 small stickers
   - From trading large stickers: 60 small buttons
   - Total small buttons = 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons

8. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 9 large buttons
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons
   - Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons

9. **Total Buttons:**
   - Total small buttons: 63
   - Total large buttons: 29
   - Total buttons = 63 + 29 = 92

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is equal to the total number of people on the council:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS)**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S)**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is:
   \[
   2 \times 11 = 22
   \]
3. **Medium (M)**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is:
   \[
   22 - 4 = 18
   \]
4. **Large (L)**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
5. **Extra-large (XL)**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is:
   \[
   9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of shirts needed for each size:
\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can start by determining the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as P. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * P = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

P = 18 * (3/2)
P = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. The third house needs double the first house, which is:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:

25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour, so the distance hiked is:

1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles

Now, we need to find out how long they drove. The total travel time was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:

6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours

The distance they drove is the product of the driving time and the driving speed:

4.5 hours * 50 miles per hour = 225 miles

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

- Enemies: \( (E + 8) \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( (B + 3) \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( (T - 4) \times 30 \)

Emma's points:
- Enemies: \( E \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( B \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( T \times 30 \)

Now, let's calculate the total points for each:

Ava's total score:
\[ 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

Emma's total score:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

The difference between their scores:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ = -25 \]

The difference between their two scores is:

"To find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost, we can start by subtracting the total cost of the two pizzas that we know the price of from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. So, the cost of the remaining two pizzas is:

64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the remaining pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each:

34 dollars / 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To solve this, let's break it down:

- For 5 days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day.
- For 2 days, they ride their bikes twice as much as on the usual days, which means 3 times 2, so 6 times a day.

Now, calculate the total number of rides for the week:

- For the 5 days: \(5 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 15 \text{ rides}\)
- For the 2 days: \(2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ rides/day} = 12 \text{ rides}\)

Add the rides together to get the total for the week:

\(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to and from work each day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of workdays in a week to get the total weekly distance.
3. Determine the total amount of fuel used per week by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency.
4. Calculate the total cost of the fuel used per week by multiplying the total amount of fuel used by the price per gallon.

Let's go through these steps:

1. One-way distance to work is 5 miles, so the round trip (to and from work) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
2. Andy works 5 days a week, so the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.
3. Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon, so the total fuel used per week is 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons/week.
4. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of fuel per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week for his commute to work.

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from both the tomato plants and the eggplant plants.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Finally, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants
- Total fruits = 110 + 32 = 142

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total number of TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) smart TVs.

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \) analog TVs.

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:
   - The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. The total number of TVs sold is 40, so the number of OLED TVs is \( 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \).

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total amount of money required for the trip after the school's contribution. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate the school's contribution as follows:

School's contribution = 1/2 * Total cost of the trip
School's contribution = 1/2 * $300
School's contribution = $150

Now, we need to find out how much John needs to contribute. This is the remaining half of the trip cost:

John's required contribution = Total cost of the trip - School's contribution
John's required contribution = $300 - $150
John's required contribution = $150

John currently has $50, so the amount of money he is missing is:

Money missing = John's required contribution - Money John has
Money missing = $150 - $50
Money missing = $100

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the temperature at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33 degrees
Night temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees
Night temperature = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Temperature increase needed = Desired temperature - Night temperature
Temperature increase needed = 32 degrees - 12 degrees
Temperature increase needed = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:

Number of logs = Temperature increase needed / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log
Number of logs = 4

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people are split into groups of 9, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10:

\[ \text{Number of groups with seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by these groups is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]

"To calculate Jamie's pay for the day she worked 11 hours, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay**: Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.
   - Regular pay = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

2. **Overtime Pay**: For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at 150% of her regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime hourly rate = 150% of $20 = 1.5 * $20 = $30/hour
   - Overtime pay = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. **Total Pay for the Day**: Sum of regular pay and overtime pay.
   - Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

"To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class.
- Therefore, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate is 40%. Therefore, the fifth-graders' pass rate is 80%. This means 80% of 400 fifth-graders passed, which is \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \) fifth-graders.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)
- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.70 \times 100 = 70\% \]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area that can be covered.

First, calculate the total number of glass chips:
Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.
Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Next, determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Now, since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:
Length = Total square inches / Height
Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals on the flowers Rose picked and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. First, she picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

Since she drops 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals from one of each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtracting the petals from the dropped flowers from the total gives:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total marshmallows in the bag**: 35
2. **Marshmallows used by John**: 9
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean**: 9
4. **Marshmallows dropped on the ground**: 3

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:
\[ 9 \text{ (John)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \]

Next, subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 marshmallows left in the bag. Since John and DeSean are sharing these marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:
\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

Each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \)

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \)

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the other amounts:
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]
\[ o = 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Calculate the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - Total cars no longer with Joe: \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Determine the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he has \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars left.

The final number of cars Joe has left is:

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Since there are 20 students, and they each raised the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

Each student raised $6,250.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days to get the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the school parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ cars}
   \]
3. When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he noticed that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ cars}
   \]
4. The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35 \text{ cars}
   \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the number of cycles, tasks per cycle, and the pay per task.

1. First, calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day:
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\) tasks.

2. Next, calculate the daily earnings:
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the daily earnings are \(150 \times 1.20 = 180\) dollars.

3. Finally, calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are \(180 \times 7 = 1260\) dollars.

John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we first need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food.

For cat food:
8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins

For dog food:
6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food to find the difference:
88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given as 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance \(D\) is the same for all animals. The speed of one kangaroo \(S_k\) can be calculated as:
   \[
   S_k = \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}}
   \]

2. Since the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle \(S_t\) is:
   \[
   S_t = \frac{S_k}{2} = \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). The combined speed of 4 turtles is:
   \[
   4 \times S_t = 4 \times \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{4D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}
   \]

4. The time \(T\) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \(D\) is:
   \[
   T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ P + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ P + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ P + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 350 - 230 \]
\[ P = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he gets from slicing 3 large and 5 small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples will yield:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will yield:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together gives us the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices left

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current cows. 

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. The farmer has 3 cows, so the total milk production is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional amount of milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 of its length left. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 of its length left. The remaining length is:
   \[

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 of its length left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}

Now, we add the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Total socks: 30 (Jack) + 60 (Peter) = 90 socks
- Total dishes: 60 (Jack) + 30 (Peter) = 90 dishes

Adding these together gives the total number of items:

90 (socks) + 90 (dishes) = 180

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total, and 5 + 8 = 13 students are good at only one of the subjects, the number of students good at both is:

20 - 13 = 7 students

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

The intermission takes 10 minutes, so the time available for performances and transitions is:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to 10 minutes per group.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. To convert this to a decimal rate, we divide by the principal: \( r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
975"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - White shirts with collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - White shirts with no collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Floral Shirts:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Floral shirts with no buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Difference:**
   - Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts with no collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to calculate the number of trays he can fill with 900 eggs and then multiply that by the price per tray.

1. Calculate the number of trays:
   Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
   Number of trays = 900 / 30
   Number of trays = 30

2. Calculate the total earnings:
   Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
   Total earnings = 30 * $2.5
   Total earnings = $75

The farmer will earn $75.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of goats:**
   - Farm X: 55 goats
   - Farm Y: 45 goats

2. **Goats sold:**
   - From Farm X: 10 goats
   - From Farm Y: Twice as many as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats

3. **Goats remaining after the sale:**
   - Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats
   - Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats

4. **Total goats remaining in both farms:**
   - Total goats = Goats in Farm X + Goats in Farm Y
   - Total goats = 45 + 25 = 70

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs bought:
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
$110"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Baskets**: Each basket of green food costs $25. If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost for the green baskets is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75
   \]

2. **Cost of Red Baskets**: Each basket of red food costs $18. If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost for the red baskets before the discount is:
   \[
   3 \times 18 = 54
   \]

3. **Discount on Red Baskets**: You get $2 off for each basket of red food. Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Total Cost for Red Baskets After Discount**: Subtract the total discount from the total cost of the red baskets:
   \[
   54 - 6 = 48
   \]

5. **Total Cost for All Baskets**: Add the total cost of the green baskets and the total cost of the red baskets after the discount:
   \[
   75 + 48 = 123

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many rooms constitute one-half of the total rooms at the KozyInn Motel. 

Given that there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms would be:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it would take to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes to clean 45 rooms is:
\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes, and then double this amount, which is \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up the total number of homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built over the three years: \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\)

"Let's denote your age as \( x \). According to the problem:

- You are three years younger than your brother, so your brother's age is \( x + 3 \).
- You are two years older than your sister, so your sister's age is \( x - 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old.

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs. This will ensure that he has enough glue sticks for all the students and some extra.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Volume of Water**: The initial volume of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Volume After Heavy Rain**: After a day of heavy rain, the volume of water doubles. Therefore, the volume of water becomes:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Volume on the Third Day**: On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the volume of water on the third day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial ten people infected.

- **Day 0**: 10 people are initially infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Each of the 70 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Each of the 490 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, after three days, the total number of people infected is 3430.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate Rafaela's total tips:**
   - Each of the 40 customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip.
   - Total tips for Rafaela = 40 customers * $20/customer = $800.

2. **Calculate Julieta's total tips:**
   - Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela.
   - 10% of Rafaela's total tips = 10% of $800 = 0.10 * $800 = $80.
   - Julieta's total tips = Rafaela's total tips - 10% of Rafaela's total tips = $800 - $80 = $720.

3. **Calculate the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:**
   - Total tips = Rafaela's total tips + Julieta's total tips = $800 + $720 = $1520.

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of books each person has with variables:
- Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]

"To determine how much money Isaias spent on the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.**

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.**

Each chicken is sold for $50:

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

1. **Hair:** Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. **Manicure:** She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure as she did on her hair. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. **Pedicure:** She spent 3/4 as much on a pedicure as she did on a manicure.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of all the services:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
575"
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling her 20-meter rope at $2 per meter:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this money she will spend on buying a new rope at $1.5 per meter. Assuming she buys a new rope of the same length (20 meters):

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she made from selling the old rope to find out how much money she will have left over:

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation to find her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - The cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.
   - The total cost for 6 packs of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - The total cost for 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - The cost of one pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2.
   - The total cost for 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we sum up the total costs of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly’s budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first account for the 15-minute encore in the final concert. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so the main part of the final concert, excluding the encore, is:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert's main part is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the main part of the final concert by 2:

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the original number of toys he had. Argo originally had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

The total number of toys given away is:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Now, subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys:
200 (original toys) - 150 (toys given away) = 50 toys

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the numbers together:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones are left without a space to fit in after the arrangement. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones are left without a space, so the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) petals.

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) petals.

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:
- \(40 - 25 = 15\)

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
- A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.

First, we find the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we calculate the speed of a whirligig:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

"To calculate Mark's weekly earnings after the pay raise, we first need to determine his new hourly wage and then calculate his total earnings based on his work schedule.

1. Mark's original hourly wage was $10.
2. His pay was raised by $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.
3. Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week.
4. To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works each week: $12 * 40 = $480.

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
3. The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's.

First, we need to determine how many times Tasha mowed each lawn based on the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

- For Kamala's lawn, she mowed it \( 3J \) times.
- For Alba's lawn, she mowed it \( 5J \) times.

Since Joe paid $6 for his lawn, we can assume that the payment for each lawn mowed is the same. Therefore, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:

\[ \text{Total from lawns} = 6J + 6 \times 3J + 6 \times 5J \]
\[ \text{Total from lawns} = 6J + 18J + 30J \]
\[ \text{Total from lawns} = 54J \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 last month, and this total includes both her lemonade sales and her lawn mowing earnings. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Therefore:

\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

We also know that Joe paid $6, so \( J = 1 \) (since Joe's lawn was mowed once).

Substituting \( J = 1 \) into the equation:

\[ L + 54 \times 1 = 80 \]
\[ L + 54 = 80 \]
\[ L = 80 - 54 \]
\[ L = 26 \]

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

3. Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight:
   \[
   \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight:
   \[
   \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total capacity of the pot in terms of bowls:**
   - The pot can hold enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Convert the pot's capacity to a common unit:**
   - Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (because 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls), we can say that the pot holds 8 child bowls.

3. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for dinner:**
   - Calvin (1 adult bowl) + his wife (1 adult bowl) + 2 children (2 child bowls) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 bowls.
   - Converting the adult bowls to child bowls: 2 adult bowls = 4 child bowls.
   - Total bowls needed for dinner = 4 child bowls (from adults) + 2 child bowls (from children) = 6 child bowls.

4. **Determine the leftover soup:**
   - The pot holds 8 child bowls.
   - 6 child bowls are used for dinner.
   - Leftover soup = 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

5. **Calculate how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:**
   - There are 2 child bowls of leftover soup.
   - There are 2 children.
   - Each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals fit into 3000 miles, as the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both contributed equally.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, at $7 each, is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Adding these costs together gives the total amount spent:
- $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since this total amount was contributed equally by Julia and Nadine, the amount given to each by their mother is:
- $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the total profit raised by the class from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

The profit is:

The class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find out how many pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so:
   \[ \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:
   \[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7 \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so:
   \[ \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish he has, so:
   \[ \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]

Now, let's add up all the pets:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of rabbits} + \text{Number of fish} + \text{Number of gerbils} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours and then calculate the minimum number of berries he must pick up per trip to reach a total of 24 berries.

First, let's find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, the number of trips he can make in 8 hours is:

\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many berries he must pick up per trip to collect a total of 24 berries in 2 trips. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is:

"First, let's determine the amount of water that Anthony and his father fill into the tank. They fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, which has 10,000 gallons. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

2. At the start, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. Since there are 4 friends, the total number of balloons given to friends is:
   \[
   4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons}
   \]
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. So, the total number of balloons at the start is:
   \[
   8 \text{ balloons (friends)} + 1 \text{ balloon (Maria)} = 9 \text{ balloons}
   \]
5. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons given is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons}
   \]
6. Adding the additional balloons to the initial total:

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two more equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equations for \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

16 - 6 = 10

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

24 (measuring cups) + 10 (remaining measuring spoons) = 34

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks (14 days).
   - Total patients admitted in 14 days = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

4. **Total Occupied Beds After 14 Days**: 
   - Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 14 days = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

5. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 14 Days**:
   - Total capacity - Total occupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So, we have:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
   - Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the island had:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 40.
   - The total number of holes by the end of the third day is 29.
   - Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of Pokémon each person has caught with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation. First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[
A + S + W = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Thus, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is:
\[
147

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.
2. She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies for the surprise party.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

First, let's convert all quantities to the same unit (individual brownies), knowing that 1 dozen = 12 brownies.

- 1 dozen brownies = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen brownies = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen brownies = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies = 18 brownies

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies Greta had:

- Brownies made by Greta: 12
- Brownies from the office: 6
- Brownies from the surprise party: 48

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:

- Brownies eaten: 18

Remaining brownies = 66 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, Emil's dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old when Emil turns 24.

3. **Determine the current age of Emil's dad:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Therefore, Emil's brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old when Emil turns 24.

5. **Determine the current age of Emil's brother:**
   - Since Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.
   - Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.
   - The sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50.

"To determine how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we first need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days.

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 + 12 + 6 = 21\] pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving to find the number of servings:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7\] servings.

"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players are accounted for:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Now, we calculate 25% of the remaining 24 students to find out how many are cheerleaders or part of the band:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Finally, we add the number of football players to the number of cheerleaders and band members to find out the total number of students leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

Charlie's boot size = 5 * Sophie's boot size
Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5
Charlie's boot size = 25

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add the sizes of their boots and divide by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's boot size + Charlie's boot size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower:**
   - Each flower requires 1 foot of space.
   - Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant.
   - Therefore, the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower is \(1 + 1.5 = 2.5\) feet.

3. **Determine the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of flowers that can fit is \( \frac{111}{2.5} \).

4. **Perform the division:**
   - \( \frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 flowers.

5. **Calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional flowers needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

6. **Calculate the total cost of the additional flowers:**
   - Each flowering plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \times 6 = 162\).

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels he eats in a day. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzel consumption} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels the brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by the number of days in a week:

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, the time required is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time for peeling and the time for sauteing.
   - Total time = 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet returns every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's trips:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining one-quarter of its flights are split equally between France and Germany.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - Three-quarters of 88 trips: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips to Greece.

4. **Calculate the number of remaining trips:**
   - The remaining trips are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.

5. **Determine the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany.

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we add up the durations of all three howls:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is given by:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for the adults and the kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is 6, with 2 slices for the adults and 4 slices for the kids. The total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all slices:

\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 equal parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:

\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the number of sessions per month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented 3 days a week, which means it is rented 12 times a month (3 days/week * 4 weeks/month).

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the cost per session for the students is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The total cost per session is the sum of the rental cost and the student cost:
$25 (rental) + $15 (students) = $40 per session.

Since the studio is rented 12 times a month, the total monthly cost is:
$40 * 12 = $480.

However, the question asks for the expected earnings, which typically refers to revenue, not costs. If the question is asking for the total amount of money the studio collects (revenue), we need to know the price charged per student per session. Since this information is not provided, we can only calculate the total cost. If the question is indeed asking for the cost, then the answer is:

$480

If you meant to ask about the revenue, please provide the price charged per student per session."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. The number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   - Number of female porcupines = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \).

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Total number of babies born each month = 30 (female porcupines) × 4 (babies per female) = 120 babies.

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total number of babies born in a year = 120 (babies per month) × 12 (months) = 1440 babies.

4. **Calculate the total population after a year:**
   - Initial population = 50 porcupines.
   - Total population after a year = Initial population + Total number of babies born in a year.
   - Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The conversion factor is 5.9 gallons per cubic foot.
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \, \text{gallons/cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost is $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]

"To determine the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the number of female students in each age group.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the total students are over 16 years old.
   - Number of students over 16: \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)

3. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.
   - Number of male students over 16: \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \)

4. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students over 16 are female.
   - Number of female students over 16: \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \)

5. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The other half of the total students are under 16 years old.
   - Number of students under 16: \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)

6. **Male students under 16 years old**:
   - One-half of the students under 16 are male.
   - Number of male students under 16: \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \)

7. **Female students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students under 16 are female.
   - Number of female students under 16: \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \)

8. **Total number of female students**:
   - Sum of female students over 16 and under 16.
   - Total number of female students: \( 1125 + 750 = 1875 \)

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank before these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 3 \times 0.07x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank before these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 5 \times 0.09y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

Next, we calculate Janet's total earnings per hour, which include both her wages and tips.

\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

Now, we calculate her total earnings per week, given that she works 40 hours a week.

\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up these amounts to find the total spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining money = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"First, let's determine the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. She had 15 packs and kept 2, so she gave away:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces of sweets. Therefore, the total number of pieces she gave away is:

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

She distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends, so each friend received:

780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces/friend

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \( 24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in 30 days:**
   - One dwarf can mine \( 36 \) pounds per day.
   - In 30 days, one dwarf can mine \( 36 \times 30 = 1080 \) pounds of ore.

3. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:**
   - If one dwarf can mine \( 1080 \) pounds in 30 days, then 40 dwarves can mine \( 1080 \times 40 = 43200 \) pounds of ore in 30 days.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the pricing pattern based on the given information. The first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6. This indicates that the price per sandwich is consistent across the packages.

Let's calculate the price per sandwich:
- For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
- For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the price per sandwich is $1.50, we can use this to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost of 8 sandwiches = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"Tom initially pays $1000 towards the new bedroom set, reducing the total cost from $3000 to $2000. The remaining $2000 is what he needs to pay off with a 10% monthly interest rate.

To calculate the monthly payment, we need to understand that the 10% interest is applied to the remaining balance each month. However, the question does not specify the term of the loan or the method of repayment (e.g., fixed monthly payments, interest-only payments, etc.). Assuming the simplest case where Tom pays only the interest each month, the monthly payment would be 10% of the remaining balance of $2000.

Monthly interest payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly interest payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly interest payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month in interest. If the question implies that Tom is paying off the principal as well, more information would be needed to calculate the exact monthly payment. However, based on the information provided, the monthly interest payment is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a substitute is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is there, there are two sub-scenarios:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If an extension is given, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving a class extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If no class extension is given, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment:
         - Probability of getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
         - So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of all probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
   - Total probability of not turning in homework = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Turning in Homework:**
   - Probability of turning in homework = 1 - Probability of not turning in homework
   - Probability of turning in homework = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

"To determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
2. Seats for graduates: 950
3. Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats for friends and family = Total seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - 1250
Total seats for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the total seats for friends and family by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Total seats for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Determine Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's deliveries: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's deliveries: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209
   - Total: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

Next, we calculate the average loss per race:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = \(21.5 / 3 = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss is $7.17.

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the heights are given in both feet and inches, we will convert everything to inches for simplicity.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
1 inch"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times (x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, let's combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3.

\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.78.

"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

The normal cost of insurance is $120 a month. After the accident, the cost is 60% more than the normal cost.

First, calculate the 60% increase:
60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72

So, the new monthly cost is:
$120 + $72 = $192

Now, to find the annual cost, multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
$192 * 12 = $2,304

Therefore, James pays $2,304 a year for insurance.

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads he does each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Calculate the number of loads per week:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
   - He can wash 2 twin sets of sheets per load and 1 king set of sheets per load.
   - For the twin beds: \( \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads} \)
   - For the king size bed: \( 1 \text{ king set} = 1 \text{ load} \)
   - Total loads per week: \( 2 \text{ loads (twin)} + 1 \text{ load (king)} = 3 \text{ loads} \)

2. **Calculate the number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Therefore, the total amount of food consumed per feeding is \( 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams} \).

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, the total amount of food consumed per day is:
   - \( 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \).

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - There were 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices.

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we first need to understand the promotion and how it applies to his purchase.

1. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
2. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""

This means for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay full price for one pound and half price for the second pound.

- Cost for 1 pound of butter: $4.00
- Cost for 1 pound of butter at half price: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00

For every 2 pounds of butter, the total cost is:
- $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (half price) = $6.00

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
- 6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets of 2 pounds
- Cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds: 3 * $6.00 = $18.00

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Maggie and Riza each have left after spending a portion of their initial amounts.

Maggie initially had $60. She spent a quarter of her money:
\[ \text{Amount spent by Maggie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also initially had $60. She spent one-third of her money:
\[ \text{Amount spent by Riza} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

To find the total amount of money they have left together:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a week and then break it down by each monkey's daily consumption.

1. **Total bananas for the week:**
   - Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.

2. **Daily consumption of the first monkey:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - Over a week (7 days), the first monkey eats: \( 10 \times 7 = 70 \) bananas.

3. **Daily consumption of the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - Therefore, the second monkey eats \( 10 + 4 = 14 \) bananas each day.
   - Over a week, the second monkey eats: \( 14 \times 7 = 98 \) bananas.

4. **Total consumption of the first and second monkeys for the week:**
   - Combined, the first and second monkeys eat: \( 70 + 98 = 168 \) bananas in a week.

5. **Daily consumption of the third monkey:**
   - The total number of bananas for the week is 315.
   - The third monkey eats the remaining bananas after the first and second monkeys have eaten.
   - The remaining bananas for the third monkey for the week are: \( 315 - 168 = 147 \) bananas.
   - Therefore, the third monkey eats: \( \frac{147}{7} = 21 \) bananas each day.

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 15 roses:**
   - The cost of a dozen (12) roses is $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 + 3 roses.
   - The cost of 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost of 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for 15 roses = $15 + $6 = $21.

2. **Determine the total amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five $5 bills.
   - Total amount of money = 5 * $5 = $25.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny should receive:**
   - Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses
   - Change = $25 - $21 = $4.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Number of quarters = $4 / $0.25 = 16.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

The total number of toothpicks required for the sculpture is 200. So, the number of toothpicks Melanie still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save 80 more toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold to his friend} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend paid $1800.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

**Step 4: Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.**

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during the month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.
3. **BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.
4. **MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars.
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars (since BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, \( 500 / 2 = 250 \) dollars).
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
\[ 67,500 + 11,250 + 52,500 = 131,250 \]

Marcel earned a total of 131,250 dollars from selling bicycles during that month.

"To determine how high the ball bounces on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Determine the height of the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height of the second bounce.

First, the initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third-floor balcony. Since each story is 24 feet high, the height of the third floor is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, the height of the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height of the first bounce:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left after the velociraptors had their share.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means that the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. This means that the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, the cost of the paint is calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps based on his working days and the rate at which he helps people.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance that Amber ran, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement period, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and how much she can save each year.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement income needed:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Current annual salary: $100,000
   - Annual retirement income needed: \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \)

2. **Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement savings needed: \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \)

3. **Calculate the annual savings:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Annual savings: \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \)

4. **Determine the number of years needed to save the total amount:**
   - Total savings needed: $800,000
   - Annual savings: $20,000
   - Number of years needed: \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \)

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her 20-year retirement.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts Marty cuts from the 100 centimeters of ribbon. We do this by dividing the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts:

\[ \text{Length of each of the 4 parts} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, each of these 25 cm parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. We find the length of each of these smaller parts by dividing the length of the 25 cm part by 5:

\[ \text{Length of each of the 5 smaller parts} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To solve for \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, you need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

There are three women wearing 4-inch heels and three women wearing 2-inch heels. 

First, calculate the total height of the heels:
- Total height of 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
- Total height of 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches

Now, add these totals together to get the overall total height:
- Total height of all heels: \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches

Next, divide the total height by the number of women to find the average height:
- Number of women: \(3 + 3 = 6\)
- Average height of heels: \(18 \div 6 = 3\) inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and then figure out how many miles she plans to hike each day.

1. **Total days in June**: June has 30 days.
2. **Miles Soledad plans to hike each day**: She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, she plans to hike \(125 \times 2 = 250\) miles per day.
3. **Total miles Soledad plans to hike in June**: \(250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles}\).

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles in June. She plans to hike 7,500 miles, so the additional miles she needs to hike are:
\[9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[1800 \text{ miles} \div 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ miles/day}\]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"First, let's clarify the names in the problem. The names mentioned are Pierre, Paul, and Jacques. However, the question asks about Peter and James, who were not initially part of the group buying apples. I will assume that ""Peter"" is a typo and should be ""Pierre,"" and ""James"" is a typo and should be ""Jacques.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. The total weight of apples is 12 kg.
2. Pierre (Peter) wants a quarter of the apples:
   \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \, \text{kg} = 3 \, \text{kg} \)
3. Paul wants a third of the apples:
   \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \, \text{kg} = 4 \, \text{kg} \)

Now, we subtract the amounts Pierre and Paul want from the total to find out how much Jacques (James) will have left:

12 kg - 3 kg - 4 kg = 5 kg

Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse blinks. The lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can find the rate of blinking per minute by dividing the total number of blinks by the total time in minutes:

\[ \text{Rate of blinking} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks we want (459) by the rate of blinking (51 blinks per minute):

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent on their respective tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = Amalia's time + 4 hours = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, we sum the times for all three:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents. 

First, let's determine the one-way distance John drives to visit his parents. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

This is the one-way distance. Since John makes a round trip, the total distance for one visit is:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles/visit} \times 2 \, \text{visits/month} = 560 \, \text{miles/month} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's break down the information and calculate step by step.

1. **Total toys needed**: 400 toys.
2. **Toys still needed after the shift**: 20 toys.
3. **Toys produced during the shift**: 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total production by the first four workers:

- **Two workers producing 6 toys per hour**: 
  - Each worker produces 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 60 toys.
  - Two workers produce 60 toys * 2 = 120 toys.

- **Two workers producing 4 toys per hour**: 
  - Each worker produces 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 40 toys.
  - Two workers produce 40 toys * 2 = 80 toys.

Total production by the first four workers:
- 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

Now, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced:
- Total toys produced during the shift: 380 toys.
- Toys produced by the first four workers: 200 toys.
- Toys produced by the fifth worker: 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys.

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
- 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

2. **Total number of M&M's:**
   - Each ounce contains 30 M&M's.
   - Total number of M&M's = 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

3. **Number of small bags:**
   - Each small bag contains 10 M&M's.
   - Number of small bags = Total number of M&M's / Number of M&M's per small bag = 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags.

So, John can make 90 small bags.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Now, solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: They painted the same number of eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs each of them painted as \( A \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: They painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Camden painted as \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( C + S = 30 \)
- \( C = S + 12 \)

We can substitute \( C \) in the first equation with \( S + 12 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. Since the total number of eggs is 56 and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs:
\[ A + A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. Since each group goes into one box, there will be 25 boxes.

3. Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:
   \[
   200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. Then, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:
   \[
   25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:
   \[
   200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, knowing that there are 16 ounces in a pound:

"To determine how much John makes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the usable length of the tree.
2. Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
3. Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.

**Step 1: Calculate the usable length of the tree.**

The tree is 80 feet tall, and John can use 80% of it for logs:
\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.**

Each log is 4 feet long, so the number of logs is:

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.**

Each log yields 5 planks, so the total number of planks is:
\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.**

Each plank sells for $1.2, so the total revenue is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

For the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find out how many marbles he will have:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of cows added is \( 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \).

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of chickens added is \( 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \).

Now, let's add these increases to the initial numbers:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

Total number of cows after three weeks:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

Total number of chickens after three weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount applied, and then divide that total cost by the total number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   - Each pack costs $10.00.
   - Russell orders 4 packs.
   - Total cost without discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

3. Calculate the total cost with the discount:
   - Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

4. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   - Each pack has 9 bagels.
   - Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

5. Calculate the cost per bagel:
   - Cost per bagel = Total cost with discount / Total number of bagels = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.

The cost per bagel after the discount is $1.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem:
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.
1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Solving for x:
x = (3 potatoes * 18 scoops) / 2 scoops
x = 54 / 2
x = 27 potatoes

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

"To find out how many blue jellybeans there are, we can start by calculating the number of red jellybeans, which is twice the number of green jellybeans. There are 17 green jellybeans, so:

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. This means that the total parts of the ratio (5 parts men + 9 parts women) is 14 parts.

To find the number of men and women, we can set up the following equations based on the ratio and the total number of passengers:

- Number of men = 5/14 * 84
- Number of women = 9/14 * 84

Calculating the number of men:
\[ \text{Number of men} = \frac{5}{14} \times 84 = 30 \]

Calculating the number of women:
\[ \text{Number of women} = \frac{9}{14} \times 84 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to consider both the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers that are part of the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets per day is:
- \( 7 \text{ bouquets/day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers/bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day} \).

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = individual sunflowers + sunflowers in bouquets
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84 = 97.

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
- Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day \(\times\) 3 days = 291.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.
5. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the fruits produced each year from year 5 to year 10:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **After Giving Money to Their Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     15 - x = 12 \implies x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

3. **Amount Left with Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave \(x = 3\) dollars to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

So, the amount left in Ronnie's money is \(2\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into two main parts: half is yellow, and the other half is a combination of red, white, and purple.
2. Since half the mural is yellow, the remaining half must be divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, calculate the amount of yellow paint:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

Next, calculate the amount of paint used for the other colors:
- The remaining half of the mural is 6 pints, which is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
- Therefore, each of these colors (red, white, and purple) uses \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) pints.

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then sum these areas.

1. **Bedrooms**: Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
   \[
   20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
   \[
   4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Living Room**: The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. Therefore, the area of the living room is:
   \[
   5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Rest of the House**: The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

4. **Total Area**: To find the total area of the house, we sum the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
   \[
   960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod for the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with 10 pods:**
   - Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run with 10 pods is 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   - Number of $20 bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

2. **Losing Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills.
   - Remaining bills = 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. **Paying a Bill**: Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Bills used to pay the bill = 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
   - Remaining bills = 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. **Tripling the Money**: Thomas triples the remaining money.
   - Value of remaining bills = 20 bills * $20 = $400.
   - Tripled value = $400 * 3 = $1200.

5. **Converting to $5 Bills**: Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills.
   - Number of $5 bills = $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.

Therefore, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. Total goals scored by each team:
   - Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.

4. Total number of goals scored in the match:
   - Total goals = \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the length of the chalk after each day and determine how many days it will take for the chalk to become smaller than 2 inches.

1. **Initial Length of Chalk on Monday**: 5 inches
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches
3. **Remaining Chalk on Monday**: 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Starting from Tuesday, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

4. **Chalk Used on Tuesday**: 20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches
5. **Remaining Chalk on Tuesday**: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches

6. **Chalk Used on Wednesday**: 20% of 2.20 inches = 0.20 * 2.20 = 0.44 inches
7. **Remaining Chalk on Wednesday**: 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches

By the end of Wednesday, the remaining length of the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk at the end of Wednesday.

The number of days before the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk is 2 days (Tuesday and Wednesday).

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity and then subtract these numbers from the total number of boys and girls.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
1/3 * 12 girls = 4 girls on varsity

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
1/4 * 12 boys = 3 boys on varsity

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity

The total number of students in the class is:
12 girls + 12 boys = 24 students

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. This means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

James has 30 teeth in total. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:
   - Cost per 100 books = $500
   - Total money available = $27,000
   - Number of 100-book sets he can buy = $27,000 / $500 = 54 sets
   - Total number of books = 54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books

2. Since the books are to be distributed equally among 3 schools:
   - Number of books per school = Total number of books / 3 = 5400 books / 3 = 1800 books

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means he makes:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ snowball}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. This means the net increase in snowballs every 15 minutes is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times \frac{15 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} - 2 \text{ snowballs} = 5 \text{ snowballs} - 2 \text{ snowballs} = 3 \text{ snowballs} \]

So, every 15 minutes, the net increase in snowballs is 3. To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 3 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times t = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]
\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{3 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes}} \]
\[ t = 20 \times 15 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ t = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

4. **End of the Third Day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Now, let's determine the initial number of bandages they started with. We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + \text{Total ordered} - \text{Total used} = \text{Bandages left} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 150 - 91 = 78 \]

Solving for the initial bandages:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 59 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 59 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 19 \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

Next, we need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much root beer was available for each person at the party.

1. **Initial Amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
2. **Children's Consumption**: The children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. **Wife's Spill**: Barbie spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. **Friend's Consumption**: Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]
5. **Party Distribution**: On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among the 3 people. Therefore, each person gets:
   \[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors. So, the total number of colors from the palettes is:
   \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) colors.

2. She also had three makeup sets, each with 6 colors. So, the total number of colors from the makeup sets is:
   \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) colors.

3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors. The remaining colors from the palettes are:
   \( 8 - 4 = 4 \) colors.

4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so half of these colors is:
   \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \) colors used.

5. The remaining colors from that makeup set are:
   \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) colors.

6. The other two makeup sets are untouched, so they still have:
   \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) colors.

7. Adding up all the remaining colors, we get:
   \( 4 \) (from the remaining palette) + \( 3 \) (from the partially used makeup set) + \( 12 \) (from the other two makeup sets) = \( 4 + 3 + 12 = 19 \) colors.

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance the dogs need to walk per day. The average is calculated by dividing the total distance walked by the number of dogs.

Given that the average distance is 3 miles per day for 4 dogs, the total distance walked by all dogs is:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Average distance} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

We know the distances the first three dogs need to walk:

- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

The total distance walked by the first three dogs is:

\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance for the last dog} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance walked by first three dogs} = 12 - 8 = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. The selling price is 11/8 of the buying price.

The buying price of the magazines is $72. 

The selling price can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Now, let's calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans based on the effective volume and the volume of a single jelly bean.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on the percentage of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans.**

The volume of one jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - The new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation to represent the total length:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds required for 80 meatballs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes:**
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - This can be written as: \( b = 3c - 2 \).

3. **Determine the total number of treats:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.
   - This can be written as: \( c + b = 10 \).

5. **Substitute the expression for \( b \) into the total treats equation:**
   - Substitute \( b = 3c - 2 \) into \( c + b = 10 \):
   - \( c + (3c - 2) = 10 \).

6. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - Combine like terms: \( 4c - 2 = 10 \).
   - Add 2 to both sides: \( 4c = 12 \).
   - Divide by 4: \( c = 3 \).

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. The total cost for both without the discount is $35 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) = $75. 

The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails. The cost for nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure gives us $60 + $30 = $90.

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is $90.

"To determine the final price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November:** The toy was priced at $40.
2. **Price Increase in December:** The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72
3. **Price Decrease in January:** The price then decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the different rates for his lessons. 

1. For the standard rate lessons, he charges $80 per hour. Since he has 4 of these lessons, the total from these is:
   \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars.

2. For the veteran lessons, he reduces his rate by 25%. The reduced rate is:
   \( 80 - (80 \times 0.25) = 80 - 20 = 60 \) dollars per hour.
   Since he has 2 of these lessons, the total from these is:
   \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars.

Adding the totals from both types of lessons gives us:
\( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of the 60 apples:

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after he ate some is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

The number of apples left after giving some to his sister is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples after giving to sister} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given. If 9 novels represent 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can denote the total number of novels she has written this year as \( x \).

The equation would be:
\[ \frac{3}{4}x = 9 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ x = 3 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to find out how many hours he has traveled in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, we have the distance Michael has traveled (3600 km) and the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km). To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to determine the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide that cost by the number of sticks in the bag.

The original cost of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the cost of the bag after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per stick. There are 30 sticks in the bag, so we divide the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

This is the cost per stick in dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we need to determine how many questions she got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to pass = 77

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To solve this, let's break down the information:

- There are 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights (1 for each person).
- There are 8 rooms, so there are 2 flashlights per room, which totals 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms.
- For the candles, half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's add up all the flashlights and candles:

- Total flashlights: 4 (personal) + 16 (rooms) = 20 flashlights
- Total candles: 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles

"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the third 30 seconds, the popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. This is \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:

\[
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210
\]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the requirements:

1. **For the pool party:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, 4 gallons will require 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, 4 cups will require \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) lemons.

2. **For Allen:**
   - Allen wants 1 gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, 2 cups will require \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) lemons.

3. **Total lemons needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen: 12 lemons
   - Total: \( 24 + 12 = 36 \) lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so she meditates for \(15 \times 2 = 30\) minutes per day.
- Over 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days.
- Therefore, the total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks is \(30 \times 28 = 840\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- Over 4 weeks, the total number of yoga practice days is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) days.
- Therefore, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) minutes.

Now, we sum the time spent on both activities:
- Total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is \(840 + 1200 = 2040\) minutes.

To convert this into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

"To calculate how much money Matthew would earn, we need to determine the total amount he would receive for each half of his collection and then sum these amounts.

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers, so half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half, he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:
6 * $5 = $30

For the second half, he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:
6 * $7 = $42

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings:
$30 + $42 = $72

Therefore, Matthew would earn $72.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days it takes to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes to be filled = 84 holes.
   - Net holes filled per day = 3 holes/day.
   - Number of days to fill all holes = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - 1 week = 7 days.
   - Number of weeks = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this as follows:

1. Determine the average enrollment at Butler High School:
   \[
   \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Calculate the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \text{ students}
   \]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of items Igor actually placed on the lab bench.

1. **Test Tubes**: Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. Therefore, Igor gathered:
   \[
   \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ test tubes}
   \]

2. **Petri Dishes**: Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested. Therefore, Igor gathered:
   \[
   14 + 2 = 16 \text{ Petri dishes}
   \]

3. **Beakers**: Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor gathered the correct number initially but lost some. Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is:
   \[
   7 - x
   \]

4. **Total Items on the Lab Bench**: The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is given as 29. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} = 29
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29
   \]
   \[
   31 - x = 29
   \]
   \[
   x = 31 - 29
   \]
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract this from the number of screws he has.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg needs 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table requires \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).
5. James has 40 screws in total.

Now, subtract the number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James will have 8 screws left over.

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we first need to determine how much each individual raised.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron. Therefore, Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did.
   - Aaron's distance = 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron's speed = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Vanessa's speed = 1/8 miles per minute / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time for Vanessa = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost price of the watermelons:
   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price (CP) is $80.

2. Calculate the total selling price (SP) with a 25% profit:
   - Profit percentage = 25%
   - Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
   - Total selling price = Cost price + Total profit = $80 + $20 = $100

3. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   - Total selling price for 50 watermelons = $100
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19 years old. Since James is 18 years old, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in one hour.

- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange. Therefore, in one hour (60 minutes), she can peel:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange. Therefore, in one hour (60 minutes), she can peel:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

1. **Cost of the radiator after discount:**
   - Original price of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of the mechanic's labor:**
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of the labor

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
