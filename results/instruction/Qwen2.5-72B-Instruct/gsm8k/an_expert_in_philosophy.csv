"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total feed needed per day is:
   \[
   3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
   \[
   15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   The total feed needed for the day is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given. Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
   \[
   60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for Kylar's purchase of 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

We can break down the purchase into pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass. Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, he will be buying 8 pairs.

The cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Since he is buying 8 pairs, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the different stages of the download process and the interruption caused by the Windows update.

1. **Initial Download Phase:**
   - Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of the way through the download is \( 0.40 \times 200 \) GB = 80 GB.
   - The time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Update Interruption:**
   - The Windows update takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restart and Complete Download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.
   - The total time to download the entire 200 GB file again is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the initial download time, the update time, and the time to download the file again.
   - Total time = 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (update) + 100 minutes (restart and complete download) = 160 minutes.

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the distances John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining time (4 hours total - 2.5 hours already spent = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - On the return trip, he covered 135 miles.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Cost**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit per year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]
5. **Break-even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net annual profit:
   \[
   \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, let's break down the information step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After selling at the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
6. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

We can set up the equation based on the remaining vacuum cleaners:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \left( \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} \right) - 2 + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the cost of the boots be \( B \) dollars.
2. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 5 \) dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, the total cost of the high heels is \( B - 5 \) dollars.
3. One pair of high heels costs \( 33 \) dollars.
4. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
5. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

We know that the total cost of the high heels is \( B - 5 \) dollars. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age by \( D \) and Allen's age by \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We are also given that their total age is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the total age equation:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, solve for \( A \):
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   Therefore, Aaron has 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts consumed in 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine the cost per yogurt.
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts.
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles/hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles/hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the remaining calories.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.**

The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.**

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the remaining calories.**

Each serving is 250 calories, and the bag is 300g with 5 servings, so each serving is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ g}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ g/serving} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories. Since 250 calories are in 60 grams:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} \times 60 \text{ g/serving} = 48 \text{ g} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   - Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on all ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   - Total spent on all ties = $200 + $600 = $800

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is $800.

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to find the total distance she can travel on a full tank.

1. **Calculate the car's fuel efficiency:**
   - Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
   - Fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) = Distance traveled / Gallons used
   - Fuel efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

2. **Determine the total distance on a full tank:**
   - The car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
   - Total distance on a full tank = Fuel efficiency * Tank capacity
   - Total distance = 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 10 \text{ lbs/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ lbs} \).

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \text{ lbs/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ lbs} \).

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate the number of hours James slept. James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the hours Harry slept. Since Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we find the difference in the hours they slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda’s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the initial volume of tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Initial volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of cans used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - Number of cans used = Initial volume of tomatoes / Volume per can = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Total number of tomatoes used = Number of cans * Tomatoes per can = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left in the line is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To determine how many potted plants Mary will have remaining, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.
2. Subtract the number of plants she will give away.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

Next, add the 18 new potted plants she received:
- The total number of potted plants she now has is \( 80 + 18 = 98 \).

Now, let's determine how many plants she will give away:
- She will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the number of plants she will give away is \( 40 \).

Finally, subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:
- The number of potted plants she will remain with is \( 98 - 40 = 58 \).

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time based on the rate at which the fog bank moves and the distance it needs to cover.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the fog bank's movement is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

The city is 42 miles across. To find the total time required to cover 42 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times 3.3333 \]
\[ \text{Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. Finally, we multiply that volume by 3 to get the total volume for all boxes.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Volume = length × width × height
   - Volume of one box = \( 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and then solve for the unknown.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Each day, he watched a 1-hour episode.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours

2. **Wednesday**: He watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched.
   - Total for Wednesday: \(0.5x\) hours

3. **Thursday**: He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours

4. **Friday**: He watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours

Now, we sum up the total hours watched over the week:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Combine the known hours:
\[2 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7\]

Simplify the equation:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = 30,769.23
     \]

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - Therefore, Adrien's salary four years later is:
     \[
     40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000
     \]

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase.
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Lylah's salary four years later is:

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments based on her speed changes.

1. For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: \( 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \).

2. After the first 3 hours, she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (since 7 hours total - 3 hours already run = 4 hours).
   - Distance covered in the next 4 hours: \( 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

3. Total distance covered in 7 hours:
   - Total distance = Distance in the first 3 hours + Distance in the next 4 hours
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of each item:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for each type of item:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Dillon buys 20 peppers:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Dillon buys 10 oranges:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q \]
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the events and calculate the number of bees at each stage:

1. **First 6 hours**: 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Next 6 hours**: 1/2 of the 30 bees return. This means \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.
3. **Following 6 hours**: Two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive. This means \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. **Last 6 hours**: Every bee that left before and hadn't already returned returns to the hive. 

To find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours, we need to determine how many bees left and did not return before this period:
- Initially, 30 bees left.
- 15 of these 30 bees returned.
- Therefore, \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees did not return.
- Additionally, 60 more bees left the hive.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all the days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total class hours for the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[

- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Adding these together gives the total monthly requirement:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first need to calculate the total distance each person runs.

**Blake's Distance:**
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).
- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth run is 200 yards.
- Total distance for this part: \( 1 \times 200 = 200 \) yards.
- Kelly then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).
- Total distance for this part: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
- Kelly's total distance: 2920 yards.
- Difference: \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

The winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase interval:**
   - Initial price: $20
   - Increase interval: every 2 months
   - Increase rate: 20% of the original price

2. **Calculate the number of increases over 36 months:**
   - 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

3. **Determine the price after each increase:**

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be expressed as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \):

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to break down the costs and revenues step by step.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( R \) be the total revenue.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost.
   - Profit is calculated as \( R - C = 25 \).

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, totaling $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - The revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total revenue \( R \) is \( 10G \).

4. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - From the profit equation \( R - C = 25 \), substitute \( R \) and \( C \):
     \[
     10G - 5G = 25

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount after the donation.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[

   \]

3. **Remaining Amount after Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount after Donation:**
   \[

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
     \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
   - To express this as a percentage, we convert the ratio to a percentage:
     \[
     2 \times 100\% = 200\%
     \]

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

3. **Straw for Hamsters**: Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 cages of hamsters.
4. **Straw for Rabbits**: 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

First, calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw distributed to find the straw used for the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, so the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to account for the costs and the profit. Let's denote the number of bags by \( n \).

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: The trader buys each bag for $20. Therefore, the total cost for buying \( n \) bags is \( 20n \).

2. **Transportation cost**: The cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is \( 2n \).

3. **Total cost**: The total cost for the trader is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost, which is \( 20n + 2n = 22n \).

4. **Selling price**: The trader sells each bag for $30. Therefore, the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \).

5. **Profit**: The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the profit is $400. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   30n - 22n = 400
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   8n = 400
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual Change in Trees**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. Therefore, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of Trees After 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Number of flamingos taken back and painted white on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out on the front yard.

3. **Number of pink and white flamingos on Saturday morning:**
   - After taking back 6 pink flamingos, 12 pink flamingos remain.
   - 6 white flamingos are added back to the front yard.
   - So, on Saturday morning, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

4. **Number of flamingos added on Sunday morning:**
   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

5. **Difference between the number of pink and white flamingos on Sunday noon:**
   - The number of pink flamingos is 30.
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white chickens than red chickens. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( x \).

The total number of customers over the three days can be expressed as:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of payments, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes and then subtract the total amount she will have paid.

1. **Calculate the total amount owed:**
   - Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%.
   - The additional 10% of $2000 is \( 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \).
   - Therefore, the total amount owed is \( 2000 + 200 = 2200 \).

2. **Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months:**
   - Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months.
   - The total amount paid is \( 165 \times 12 = 1980 \).

3. **Calculate the remaining balance:**
   - The remaining balance is the total amount owed minus the total amount paid.
   - The remaining balance is \( 2200 - 1980 = 220 \).

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months is $220.

"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of flower in the vase. We know there are 4 roses. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias can be calculated as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Next, we find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( f \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we solve for \( f \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

Thus, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate on both days, then convert these numbers into calories, and finally find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister.

1. **Calculate the number of cookies each ate:**
   - On Monday:
     - Sister ate 5 cookies.
     - Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
   - On Tuesday:
     - Sister ate 13 cookies.
     - Sue ate twice as many as her sister: \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \) cookies.

2. **Total cookies eaten by each:**
   - Sister: \( 5 + 13 = 18 \) cookies.
   - Sue: \( 20 + 26 = 46 \) cookies.

3. **Convert cookies to calories:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Sister's total calories: \( 18 \times 200 = 3600 \) calories.
   - Sue's total calories: \( 46 \times 200 = 9200 \) calories.

4. **Calculate the difference in calories:**
   - Difference: \( 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \) calories.

Thus, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - Total students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students.

2. **Total number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Total boys = 50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys.
   - Total girls = 50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

3. **Number of girls in each class:**
   - First class: 15 girls.
   - Second class: 12 girls.
   - Total girls in the first two classes = 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Total girls in the school = 30 girls.
   - Girls in the third class = 30 girls - 27 girls = 3 girls.

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**

"To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the slide.
2. Use Anne's number of slides to find out how many times Robert went down the slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of 30, we calculate:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \] times.

Next, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we multiply Anne's number of slides by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Thus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
- The total weight of the tree is \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate:
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- The weight of the wood eaten by the termites is \( 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \).

Finally, subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

From point 3, if Jamal has 44 apples, then he has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

From point 2, if Jamal has 48 bananas, then Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea's fruits: \(52\) apples + \(24\) bananas = \(76\) fruits.
- Jamal's fruits: \(44\) apples + \(48\) bananas = \(92\) fruits.

Total fruits = \(76 + 92 = 168\).

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the flour needed for today:**
   - Carla is making 36 cookies today.
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the number of cups needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for tomorrow:**
   - Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow.
   - Using the same proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total flour needed:**
   - Add the flour needed for today and tomorrow:
     \[
     6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Selling Price of the House**: $350,000
2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]
3. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the House**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the various expenses and the remaining loan amount he paid off. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fee} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 = \$32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid for the remaining loan:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining loan amount} = \$250,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total deductions from the selling price:**

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given and calculate the lines for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines in the lyrics.
   - All 54 lines are his to memorize.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first calculate the daily egg consumption and then extend that to a week.

1. Identify the number of people eating different amounts of eggs:
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - Two people eat 2 eggs each day.

2. Calculate the daily egg consumption for each group:
   - For the three people eating 3 eggs each: \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\)
   - For the two people eating 2 eggs each: \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\)

3. Add the daily consumption of both groups to get the total daily consumption:
   - Total daily consumption: \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\)

4. Calculate the total weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
   - Total weekly consumption: \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}\)

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The population of Chile now is:

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.
2. Calculate the total weight of these marbles.

First, let's find out how many marbles Solomon has in total:
- Solomon initially had 50 marbles.
- He bought 20 more marbles from Johanna, so he now has \(50 + 20 = 70\) marbles.
- His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

Adding the marbles from his father to the total:
- Total marbles Solomon has = \(70 + 8 = 78\).

Next, we calculate the total weight of the marbles:
- Each marble weighs 2 kg.
- Therefore, the total weight of 78 marbles is \(78 \times 2 = 156\) kg.

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \).

The equation for the total number of pencils Jam has is:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, and then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.
   - Salary of each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers \(\times\) Salary of each junior programmer.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers \(\times\) Salary of each senior programmer.
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = 60 \(\times\) $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers:**
   - Total payroll for all programmers = Total payroll for junior programmers + Total payroll for senior programmers.

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression for the number of people after the second stop:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To determine which job offers Nick a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for the respective taxes.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow the changes in the stock price over the two years.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   - Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   - Initial total cost = 8 shares * $8/share = $64.

2. **First Year:**
   - The stock price increases by 50%.
   - New price per share = $8 + (50% of $8) = $8 + $4 = $12.
   - Value of shares after the first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96.

3. **Second Year:**
   - The stock price decreases by 25%.
   - New price per share = $12 - (25% of $12) = $12 - $3 = $9.

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

We are also told that there are twice as many chickens as cows, which gives us the second equation:
\[ H = 2C \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting \( C \) back into the second equation:
\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds

"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we start by understanding that he sold 3/5 of his land, which means he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, 2/5 of \( x \) is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

First, we calculate \( 12.8 \times 5 \):

\[
12.8 \times 5 = 64
\]

Next, we divide 64 by 2:

\[
64 \div 2 = 32
\]

Thus, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

   - The choir has 52 members.
   - 50% of the members are boys, and 50% are girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
   - Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

2. **Determine the number of girls performing:**
   - The performance is with just the female members.
   - Number of girls performing = 26

3. **Determine the number of girls who can make it to the performance:**
   - Half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down.
   - Number of girls who can make it = 26 / 2 = 13

4. **Determine the total number of people who sang in the performance:**
   - The 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls.

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

2. Convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
   - 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatts = 7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day.

3. Calculate the reduced daily energy consumption:
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day.
   - New usage time = 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours/day.
   - Reduced daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - Reduced daily energy consumption in kilowatts = 2700 watts/day / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = Original daily consumption - Reduced daily consumption.
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = Daily energy savings * 30 days.
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

Therefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, he walked \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) steps to and from school.
3. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

Let's calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog:
- Steps to and from school: 5,000
- Steps with his friend: 1,000
- Total steps before the jog: \( 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \)

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total steps he had taken by the end of his jog is:
- Total steps before the jog: 6,000
- Steps left to reach 10,000: 2,000
- Total steps taken by the end of the jog: \( 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \)

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
- Steps taken by the end of the jog: 8,000
- Steps taken before the jog: 6,000
- Steps taken during the jog: \( 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \)

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and then account for the travel time to the airport.

1. **Calculate the total number of words in the book:**
   - The book is 45 pages long.
   - Each page averages 200 words.
   - Total words = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words.

2. **Calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book:**
   - Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.
   - Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time Toby needs to be ready to leave:**
   - Time to read the book = 30 minutes.
   - Time to get to the airport = 10 minutes.
   - Total time needed = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes.

4. **Determine how many minutes early Toby will be:**
   - Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.
   - Total time needed = 40 minutes.
   - Time early = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to break down the payments for each month and then sum them up.

1. **May:**
   - Number of employees: 40
   - Pay rate: $15 per hour
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

   Total payment for May:
   \[
   40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 40 \times 40 \times 4 \times 15
   \]
   \[
   40 \times 40 = 1600
   \]
   \[
   1600 \times 4 = 6400
   \]
   \[
   6400 \times 15 = 96000
   \]

2. **June:**
   - Number of employees: 40 - (1/4 of 40) = 40 - 10 = 30
   - Pay rate: $15 per hour
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

   Total payment for June:
   \[
   30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 30 \times 40 \times 4 \times 15
   \]
   \[
   30 \times 40 = 1200
   \]
   \[
   1200 \times 4 = 4800

"To determine how much money Sally has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Cost of taffy:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Cost of the mixed bag of seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of the magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

5. **Money left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - She spent $7.00.
   - Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

1. Calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
   - The first package costs $400.
   - The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. Add the costs of the two packages:
   - Total cost of the two packages is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
   - The discount amount is \(0.20 \times 1200 = 240\) dollars.
   - The cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.

4. Add the cost of the finale firework:
   - The finale firework costs $150.
   - Total cost is \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 by 30:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cookies into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. 

First, we know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles will explode. 

1. Calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. Calculate the number of exploding candles that also smell like wet dog:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \text{ candles} \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ 25 \]

"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

1. Calculate the discount amount per blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is \( 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price per blouse is \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost for 4 blouses is \( 4 \times 14 = 56 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and set up equations based on the given data.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
   - From the average trees: Let this be \( x \) apples

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 \)
   - Combined total: \( (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500 \)

Now, let's set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
45 + x + 105 = 500
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
150 + x = 500
\]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[
x = 350
\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

\[

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels.
2. Let \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
- The total number of humps is 304.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   \[
   200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   \[
   30\% \times 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Next 1 day**: He wasn't traveling at all.
   \[
   0 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   \[
   300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
   \]

Now, summing all the distances:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of Timothy's locker based on the given relationships between the sizes of the lockers.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker:

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we calculate the difference between the comb's elevation and Oliver's current elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods mentioned:

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   - Cost = 6 months * $8/month = $48

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   - Cost = 8 months * $12/month = $96

3. **Remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   - Since 2 years is 24 months, and the first 14 months are already accounted for (6 + 8), the remaining period is 24 - 14 = 10 months.
   - Cost = 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we sum up the costs for all periods:
- Total cost = $48 + $96 + $140 = $284

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to go to the amusement park:**
   - The ticket costs $100.
   - He also wants $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he needs is \(100 + 50 = 150\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny needs to sell to get $150:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards he needs to sell is \( \frac{150}{1.5} \).

3. **Perform the division:**
   - \( \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \) cards.

4. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - If he sells 100 cards, these 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection (since he keeps 1/3 and sells 2/3).
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \).
   - \( x = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would only have one hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26 / 2 = 13 guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 13.

"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount. 

1. The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
2. The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
3. The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had 1% of his money left after spending, which means he spent 99% of his money.
   - If 1% of his money is the remaining amount, then 1% of $5 is $0.05.
   - Therefore, 99% of $5 is $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents.
   - The total cost for the chips is 3 * 40 cents = 120 cents = $1.20.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents.
   - The number of candy bars George bought is $3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater and then calculate how much earlier she should leave compared to Wayne.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Determine the time difference:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Bernadette should leave:**
   - If Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) minutes (since it takes him 4 minutes to reach the theater), Bernadette needs to leave early enough to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, so she needs to leave \( 16 \) minutes before \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, Bernadette should leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

5. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave compared to Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes.
   - Bernadette leaves at \( T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is:
6 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.5 feet

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
2 remoras * 0.5 feet per remora = 1 foot

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

(Combined length of remoras / Shark's body length) * 100%

Substituting the values we have:
(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of insects each person found with variables:
- Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
2. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)
3. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (Together they found 43 insects)

First, substitute \( D \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7 \]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the third equation:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ B = 18 \]

Now, find \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \]

Finally, find \( L \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J \]
\[ \text{Total sofas} = 20 + 64 \]
\[ \text{Total sofas} = 84 \]

\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = 22 + 66 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = 88 \]

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Total sofas} + \text{Total chairs} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 84 + 88 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 172 \]

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out the cost of the headphone set. 

1. Tom paid a total of $48 for both the CD and the headphone set.
2. The cost of the CD is $4.
3. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is \( 48 - 4 = 44 \) dollars.

Next, we need to calculate how many additional CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set.

4. Each CD costs $4.
5. The number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is \( \frac{44}{4} = 11 \).

Thus, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we first consider the standard routine and then add the extra hours from the weeks that deviated from this routine.

1. Josh's standard routine is 4 hours per week. Over 8 weeks, this would be:
   \( 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \)

2. However, there are deviations:
   - For two consecutive weeks, he spent 5 hours each week, which is 1 hour extra per week for two weeks:
     \( 1 \text{ extra hour/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 2 \text{ extra hours} \)
   - For one week, he spent 6 hours, which is 2 hours extra for that week:
     \( 2 \text{ extra hours} \)

3. Adding the extra hours to the standard total:
   \( 32 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ extra hours} + 2 \text{ extra hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \)

Thus, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is 36 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. So, one-third of 21 is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:
\[
66

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and use it to find the cost of one monitor.

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of 2 monitors} + \text{Cost of printer} = 2400 \]
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine the known costs:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with \( M \):
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \)."

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 \]

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To determine how many vlogs Emma needs to complete to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

1. Vlogs made in the first week: 18
2. Vlogs made in the second week: 21
3. Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Adding these together gives us the total number of vlogs made so far:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs in a month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the savings for each half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves per day in the first half.
   - He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, so he will save \( 2x \) per day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   - Total savings for the month: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \)
   - Elvis's target is $1125, so we set up the equation: \( 45x = 1125 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45}
   \]
   \[
   x = 25

   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the average weight of the three friends is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the sun from the ground and the rate at which the sun moves upward.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) degrees upward.

To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle to the angle the sun has moved upward:

\[ 32 + 50 = 82 \]

Thus, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs. 

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles required:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

"To determine how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- Total pages in two weeks = \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( n \) represent the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

Shiloh's current age is 44 years. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, in 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( n + 7 \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(n + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( n \):
\[ 51 = 3(n + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3n + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3n \]
\[ 30 = 3n \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy, we can break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For each of the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, for three teeth, she received:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For each of the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, she received:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
   \]
   Therefore, for two teeth, she received:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
9.00

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Determine the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second shop orders 15 roses, and the third shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Now, for a month (4 weeks):
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 3B
\]

So,

\[
3B = 4500
\]

Solving for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
\]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]

Thus, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow from 4 feet to a height greater than 20 feet, given that it doubles in height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( H(n) \). The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, so \( H(0) = 4 \) feet.

Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, the height on day \( n \) can be expressed as:
\[ H(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( H(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height for each day until it exceeds 20 feet:
- Day 0: \( H(0) = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \) feet
- Day 1: \( H(1) = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \) feet
- Day 2: \( H(2) = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \) feet
- Day 3: \( H(3) = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \) feet

On day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - A cup of mushrooms (100 grams) contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, 1 gram of mushrooms contains \( \frac{3}{100} = 0.03 \) grams of protein.

2. **Calculate the protein content for 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms contain \( 200 \times 0.03 = 6 \) grams of protein.

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.
   - Over a week (7 days), he gets \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams of protein.

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to earn after his deposit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the base cost is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

2. **Subtract the deposit from the total cost:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

3. **Determine how many hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: \(3900 \div 15 = 260\) hours.

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed of the plane is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. 

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which Ruiz and Marissa make chocolates.

1. **Ruiz's Rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's rate is \( \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

2. **Marissa's Rate:**
   - Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

3. **Total Production in 12 Hours:**
   - Ruiz's production in 12 hours: \( 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Marissa's production in 12 hours: \( 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Total Production Together:**
   - Total pounds of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa together: \( 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \).

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate his earnings for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the first four hours were \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, his total earnings were \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the next two hours were \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, his total earnings were \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, Patrick earned a total of 42 dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations in one year (12 months):
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. 

The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. Therefore, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per wash. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents).

The cost per wash is:
\[ \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{240 \text{ washes}} = 10 \text{ cents per wash} \]

Since each wash uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is:
\[ 10 \text{ cents} \]

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. Therefore, to find the speed in kb per hour, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600:

\[ 20 \, \text{kb/second} \times 3600 \, \text{seconds/hour} = 72000 \, \text{kb/hour} \]

Next, we convert kb per hour to Mb per hour. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:

\[ 72000 \, \text{kb/hour} \div 1000 = 72 \, \text{Mb/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cars towed over the week, considering the different rates for the first three days and the remaining four days.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. Thus, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. Adding the totals from the first three days and the remaining four days gives us the total number of cars towed for the week:
   \[
   30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height requirement of 4 feet is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches. We can set up the equation:

40 inches + (2 inches/year * number of years) = 48 inches

Solving for the number of years:

2 inches/year * number of years = 48 inches - 40 inches
2 inches/year * number of years = 8 inches
number of years = 8 inches / 2 inches/year
number of years = 4

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the price of the gold jewel:**
   - The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   - Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, the price of the gold jewel is:
     \[
     \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
     \]

2. **Determine the price of the silver jewel:**
   - The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.
   - Given that the price of the gold jewel is $1600, the price of the silver jewel is:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, the relative speed is:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed. The distance Tom needs to cover to catch up is 75 miles, and he is closing this gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Therefore, the time \( t \) it takes for Tom to catch up is:
\[ t = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per class over $10.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: $60
2. **Total Number of Classes**: 10

If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

This is within the acceptable limit of $10 per class. Now, let's determine how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate the number of customers each processes daily and then extend that to a weekly total.

1. **Daily Production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so Julie processes \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) customers per day.

2. **Weekly Production:**
   - Both work 7 days a week.
   - Jewel's weekly production: \( 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \).
   - Julie's weekly production: \( 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \).

3. **Total Weekly Production:**
   - Total weekly production for both: \( 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \).

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

2. **Free Hour**: He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
3. **Cost Structure**:
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each paid hour:
- **First paid hour**: $15
- **Second paid hour**: $15 * 2 = $30
- **Third paid hour**: $30 * 2 = $60

Now, sum up the costs for the 3 paid hours:
- Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

Therefore, James paid:

"To determine how much of Sally's wage was withheld, we need to calculate the total amount of money that should have been in her bank account if she had received her full wage and then compare it to the actual amount in her account.

1. Sally's bank account started with $200.
2. Her weekly wage should be $300.
3. If she had received her full wage, her bank account would have $200 (initial amount) + $300 (wage) = $500.
4. However, her bank account now holds $420.
5. The difference between what her account should hold and what it actually holds is $500 - $420 = $80.

Therefore, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves}
   \]

2. Determine the number of whole eggs required:
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:
\[ \text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. **Initial cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly fuel expenses**: Twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Hanger rental + Fuel expenses
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost = Initial cost + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the cooking times for each item.

1. **Cooking time for rice**: It is given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Cooking time for beans**: The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all the food:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total cooking time for all the food is:
\[
120 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- 1/2 pound of almonds at $10 per pound: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds at $10 per pound: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( S = 15 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 more toys to have one toy for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, he finds that there are twice as many dogs as when he left. Initially, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one toy for each of the 24 dogs. Now he has 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so there are now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys, which is exactly the number of dogs.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies, which we'll call \( C \).

1. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**
   - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
   - Therefore, Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies Katarina has:**
   - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
   - Therefore, Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
   - We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies.
   - So, \( C + 7 = 68 \).
   - Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 68 - 7 = 61 \).

3. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**
   - Max has \( C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \) cookies.

4. **Determine the number of cookies Summer has:**
   - Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
   - Therefore, Summer has \( 73 + 23 = 96 \) cookies.

5. **Determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:**
   - The Cookie Monster has \( C = 61 \) cookies.

6. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   - Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Summer's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies
   - Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 96 + 61

Now, let's add these numbers together:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

First, we express the extension of the dress in terms of \( L \):
- The extension is 50% of \( L \), which is \( 0.5L \).

So, the length of the dress after the extension but before adding the lace trim is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Next, we add the 20 cm of lace trim to this extended length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

1. They have 30 minutes in total to walk to school.
2. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
3. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

First, we add the time spent to reach the library and the fire station:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time already spent from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined ages equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework. John has:

- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting the total homework time from the time before dinner gives:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 80 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]

First, calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \):

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each of them saves over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add Rong's and Neil's total savings to find the combined total:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Thus, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

5760"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.40:
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
     \]

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

"To determine the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0 \) dollar.
   - The crate contains 5 bananas.
   - Total cost of bananas: \( 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The crate contains 12 apples.
   - Total cost of apples: \( 12 \times 0.5 = 6.0 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \( 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0 \) dollars.
   - The crate contains 7 oranges.
   - Total cost of oranges: \( 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges: \( 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0 \) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is \( 32.0 \) dollars.

1. **Red Squares**: The problem states there are 14 red squares.
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares**: The problem states there are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares**: The problem states there are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares**: The problem states there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   \[
   \text{White squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \text{ square feet}

"To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we first need to establish the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let \( G \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{Speed of the cat} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the turtle} \]

We know the speed of the cat is 15 feet/second. Therefore, we can solve for the speed of the turtle:

\[ 15 \text{ feet/second} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the turtle} \]

\[ \text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the values we have:

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:

- Total cost for the first park: $52 + $24 = $76

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10/child = $20
- Total cost for the second park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two parks:
- Savings: $76 - $48 = $28

Therefore, Jake's family will save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week after switching vendors, we need to calculate the daily savings and then extend that to a weekly total.

1. **Calculate the daily cost before the switch:**
   - The vendor used to buy tomatoes at $0.5 each.
   - He sells 500 tomatoes a day.
   - Daily cost before the switch = 500 tomatoes * $0.5/tomato = $250.

2. **Calculate the daily cost after the switch:**
   - The new vendor sells tomatoes at $0.4 each.
   - Daily cost after the switch = 500 tomatoes * $0.4/tomato = $200.

3. **Calculate the daily savings:**
   - Daily savings = Daily cost before the switch - Daily cost after the switch
   - Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50.

4. **Calculate the weekly savings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7 days
   - Weekly savings = $50 * 7 = $350.

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 a week.

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:
- Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
- In one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.
- In two 4-week months, there are \(2 \times 20 = 40\) weekdays and \(2 \times 8 = 16\) weekend days.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- On weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. Therefore, in 40 weekdays, the total number of chairs rented is \(60 \times 40 = 2400\).
- On weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. Therefore, in 16 weekend days, the total number of chairs rented is \(100 \times 16 = 1600\).

Finally, we sum the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
\[2400 + 1600 = 4000\]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading 90% of Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27).

3. **Trading 50% of Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).

4. **Trading the Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 60 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - From the first trade, Lorraine has 9 large buttons.
   - From the second trade, Lorraine has 20 large buttons.
   - From the third trade, Lorraine has 60 small buttons.
   - She also has 3 small stickers left, which are worth 3 small buttons.

   Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is:
   - Large buttons: 9 + 20 = 29
   - Small buttons: 60 + 3 = 63

   Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 92 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS):** 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is:
   \[
   2 \times 11 = 22
   \]
3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is:
   \[
   22 - 4 = 18
   \]
4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is:
   \[
   9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of shirts needed for each size:
\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. The third house needs double the first house, which is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Subtracting 5 miles per hour from this gives:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to determine the distance they drove. The total time for the trip was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance they drove is:

\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance to their vacation spot is:

255 miles"
"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to break down the scoring system and the given information.

1. **Points for enemies jumped on:**
   - Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
   - Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points for enemies: Emma gets \( 10E \) points, and Ava gets \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \) points.

2. **Points for berries collected:**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points for berries: Emma gets \( 5B \) points, and Ava gets \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \) points.

3. **Points for time left:**
   - Let \( T \) be the number of seconds Emma has left on the timer.
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points for time: Emma gets \( 30T \) points, and Ava gets \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \) points.

Now, we calculate the total scores for both Ava and Emma:

- **Emma's total score:**
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T
  \]

- **Ava's total score:**
  \[
  10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
  \]

The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
(10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:
\[
\boxed{-25}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are not specified. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. 

First, subtract the cost of the two specified pizzas from the total cost:
64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

This 34 dollars is the total cost of the remaining two pizzas. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide this total by 2 to find the cost of each:
34 dollars ÷ 2 = 17 dollars

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bike rides Chase and Rider take in a week, considering the different riding patterns on different days.

1. **Rides on usual days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Rides on special days:**
   - On 2 other days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 rides/day) is 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = Rides on usual days + Rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2(4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used per week.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, which is a round trip of:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (one way)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles per day} \]

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total distance per week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used per week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the amount of fuel used per week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons per week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.**

The price of gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of the fuel used per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons per week} \times 3 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Thus, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, which includes the quarters and a portion of the twenties.

First, let's determine the total value of the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- The total value of the quarters is \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

Next, let's determine the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has 10 twenties.
- The total value of the twenties is \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties:
- The amount spent from the twenties is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = value of quarters + value of spent twenties
- Total amount spent = 35 + 120 = 155 dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic these chips can cover.
3. Given the height of the mosaic, calculate the length.

First, calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag holds 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Next, determine how many square inches of mosaic these chips can cover:
- It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
- Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Now, given that the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length:
- Area of the mosaic = height * length.
- 12 square inches = 3 inches * length.
- Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of tea consumed and then add the remaining tea to find the initial amount. 

First, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, add the tea consumed by both groups:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Add the remaining tea to the total consumed to find the initial amount of tea:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's 20 minutes).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's 20 minutes).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \).

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces. Let:
- \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest,
- \( f \) be the amount of fragrance,
- \( s \) be the amount of salt,
- \( g \) be the amount of sugar,
- \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( z = f \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance),
2. \( s = g \) (the same amount of salt as sugar),
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt),
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest).

We also know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

Finally, find \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

Thus, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To determine how much money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the total cost of the goats:
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

2. Calculate the total cost of the cows:
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

3. Sum the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
   - Total amount spent = Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows = $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is $4500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he remains with \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the total hours into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards each person has in terms of a variable. Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has. According to the problem:

- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}

   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance covered by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \) together, we can say:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo \( S \) is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of four turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of four turtles}} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of dishes Kora made:**
   Kora made 20 dishes.

2. **Determine the number of dishes Rory made:**
   Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
   \[
   \text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the number of dishes Jada made:**
   Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.
   \[
   \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of dishes made by all three:**
   \[
   \text{Total dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Jada's dishes} = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140
   \]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the reduced price of the laptop:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many apple slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he has from slicing the apples.

1. Calculate the number of slices from the large apples:
   - Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
   - Adam slices 3 large apples.
   - Total slices from large apples = 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices.

2. Calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
   - Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
   - Adam slices 5 small apples.
   - Total slices from small apples = 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices.

3. Calculate the total number of slices from all the apples:
   - Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples = 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices.

4. Determine how many slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices:
   - Slices left = total slices - slices eaten = 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

Thus, the number of apple slices left is 15.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

1. The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. Therefore, the total milk produced by the 3 cows is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters per day.
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
4. The additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters per day.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to determine the length of the remaining parts of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. Since the original length of a glue stick is 12 millimeters, the remaining length is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Next, we sum the lengths of the remaining parts of the glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}

"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone. The car costs $10,000 and the phone costs $800, so the total cost is:

\[ 10000 + 800 = 10800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is:

\[ 5000 + 200 = 5200 \]

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 10800 - 5200 = 5600 \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

The intermission takes 10 minutes, so the time available for performances and transitions is:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes.

Each group requires:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for (3 years).

First, calculate the annual interest:
\[ \text{Annual Interest} = 225 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts without collars: 20

"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms after Mr. Smith's sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Add the remaining goats from both farms to get the total.

First, we know that Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

Next, he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Thus, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Baskets:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green baskets = 3 * $25 = $75.

2. **Cost of Red Baskets:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total cost for red baskets before discount = 3 * $18 = $54.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Total discount for red baskets = 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for red baskets after discount = $54 - $6 = $48.

3. **Total Cost:**

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many rooms constitute one-half of the total rooms at the KozyInn Motel. Given that there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms would be:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes to clean 45 rooms is:

\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year. This means they will build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Doubling this amount gives \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we add up the homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built over the three years: \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

According to the problem, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many glasses of lemonade the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold in total. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade together and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many glasses the boys sold by subtracting the number of glasses Julie sold from the total number of glasses sold:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie) = 18 glasses (boys)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2:

18 glasses (boys) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy)

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

14 glasses (Julie) - 9 glasses (Micah) = 5 glasses

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the cost of buying a new rope with the money she has.
3. Calculate the leftover money after purchasing the new rope.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 per meter.
\[ \text{Total money from selling} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine the cost of buying a new rope.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah can buy as much as she can with the $40.
\[ \text{Length of new rope} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters} \]

Since Sarah can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope.
\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 26 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 39 \, \text{dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate the leftover money.
\[ \text{Leftover money} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 39 \, \text{dollars} = 1 \, \text{dollar} \]

"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert includes a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

First, let's denote the length of her usual concert as \( x \) minutes.

The final concert, without the encore, is twice as long as her usual concert, so it is \( 2x \) minutes.

Including the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, the length of her usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Total Earnings**: Tasha made $80 in total.
2. **Earnings from Joe**: Joe paid Tasha $6.
3. **Earnings from Mowing Lawns**:
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
4. **Assumption**: Assume the payment for mowing each lawn is the same as Joe's, which is $6 per lawn.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
- Earnings from Joe: \( 6J \)
- Earnings from Kamala: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \)
- Earnings from Alba: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \)

Total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that the total earnings from all activities is $80:
\[ 54J + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 \]

Given that Joe paid Tasha $6, we can find \( J \):
\[ 6J = 6 \]
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( J = 1 \) back into the equation for total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 54 \times 1 = 54 \]

So, the earnings from mowing lawns is $54. Therefore, the earnings from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Thus, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many miles Anis rowed. According to the problem, Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Therefore, the additional distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 \times \frac{1}{5} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Pages read yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel read 0 pages today.

3. **Total pages read:**
   - Denise's total pages read: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
   - Daniel's total pages read: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

4. **Difference in pages read:**
   - The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin, his wife, and their two children each have one bowl for dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the pot contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls, which is the same as 8 child bowls.
3. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have 1 adult bowl, which is equivalent to 2 child bowls each.
4. The two children will each have 1 child bowl.

Let's calculate the total number of child bowls used for dinner:
- Calvin: 2 child bowls
- His wife: 2 child bowls
- Child 1: 1 child bowl
- Child 2: 1 child bowl

Total child bowls used for dinner:
2 (Calvin) + 2 (wife) + 1 (child 1) + 1 (child 2) = 6 child bowls

The pot originally contains 8 child bowls, so the number of child bowls left after dinner is:
8 - 6 = 2 child bowls

Each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will get 1 bowl.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.
2. Duncan's current age is 60.

First, express Duncan's age eight years ago:
\[ D - 8 \]

Next, express Adam's age four years ago:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

We also know that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60:
\[ D = 60 \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

   - Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total.
   - He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - He threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - There are 20 red balloons.

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.
   - Total pieces of bologna for red balloons = \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \).

3. **Determine the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - Total pieces of bologna thrown = 58.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 40.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons = \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

4. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Total pieces of bologna for yellow balloons = \( 3y \).

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons. 
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

2. Paul is 10 years older than John:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( A \) and \( P \):
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how many new tables are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff the charity group has. 

1. Calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people:
   \( 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \)

2. Add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have:
   \( 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \)

3. Determine how many tables are needed to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes:
   \( \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \)

4. Subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables needed:
   \( 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \)

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - Total commission from 6 copies = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we first need to understand the relationship between the thickness of the book and the number of pages. Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages per inch, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of pages per inch:
   - 100 pages per inch

2. Multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches:
   - 100 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 150 pages

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the total. However, the calculation of 150 pages already accounts for this, as it is the total number of printed pages, not the number of sheets.

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 150.

"To determine the cost of the travel tickets, we start by noting that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

First, we calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, we add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 600 \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of Pokémon each person has caught with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon: \( A + S + W = 339 \).
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( A = S + 5 \).
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught: \( S = 4W - 13 \).

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( W \).

First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4W - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Nani's Age**: Nani is 8 years old.
2. **Brother's Age**: Nani's brother is twice his age. Therefore, his brother is \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) years old.
3. **Sister's Age**: Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \( 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \) years. Therefore, Nani's sister is \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members:
- Nani: 8 years
- Brother: 16 years
- Sister: 6 years

Total age = \( 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \)

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_S = 10 \) (Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than gingerbread)
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 \) (Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday)
- \( A_U = 15 \) (Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday)

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold each day:
- \( A_S = 10 - 4 = 6 \) (boxes of apple pie on Saturday)
- \( G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \) (boxes of gingerbread on Sunday)

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 60 + 90 = 150 \) dollars

- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \) dollars

Finally, we add the total earnings from both days:
- Total earnings for two days: \( 150 + 315 = 465 \) dollars

Thus, Sunny earned a total of 465 dollars over the two days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Therefore, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month × 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

2. **Gas bill checks**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month × 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

3. **Church checks**: 2 checks per month
   - 2 checks/month × 12 months/year = 24 checks/year

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: 1 check per quarter
   - 1 check/quarter × 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12 checks/year
- Gas bill checks: 12 checks/year
- Church checks: 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4 checks/year

Total checks per year:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) flights.

3. **Determine the number of remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) flights.

4. **Distribute the remaining flights equally between France and Germany:**
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) flights.

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls last, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - The combined duration of Tobias' and Chikote's howls is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous' howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - The total combined duration of the three wolves' howls is \( 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \) seconds.

5. **Convert the total duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, \( 120 \) seconds is \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and using the information given:

- Let \( A \) be the age of Akbar.
- Let \( L \) be the age of Alessandro.
- Let \( H \) be the age of Helene.
- Let \( W \) be the age of Wilfred.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A = 3 \)
- \( L = 4 \)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + L + H + W = 20 \).

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( L \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for the adults and the kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is 6 (2 adults and 4 kids), and the total watermelon is 100% of the watermelon. Therefore, the equation representing the total watermelon is:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 100\% \]
\[ 4x + 4x = 100\% \]
\[ 8x = 100\% \]
\[ x = \frac{100\%}{8} \]
\[ x = 12.5\% \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 12.5\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge of the power bank to determine its initial charge when Maria went to the park.

1. **Final Charge After 8 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for the last 3 hours.
   - Let \( C \) be the total capacity of the power bank.
   - After 3 hours, the remaining charge is 28% of \( C \).

   The charge after the last 3 hours can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Charge after 3 hours} = 28\% \times C
   \]

2. **Charge Before the Last 3 Hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - The charge after 3 hours is:

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

1. **Cost of peaches**: 3 peaches at $0.50 each
   \[
   3 \times 0.50 = 1.50
   \]

2. **Cost of pears**: 4 pears at $0.50 each
   \[
   4 \times 0.50 = 2.00
   \]

3. **Cost of kiwis**: 2 kiwis at $1.00 each
   \[
   2 \times 1.00 = 2.00
   \]

4. **Cost of apples**: 5 apples at $0.75 each
   \[
   5 \times 0.75 = 3.75
   \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits already purchased:
\[
1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25
\]

Jamaar has $10.00, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
\[
10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75
\]

Each plum costs $0.25, so the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[
0.75 \div 0.25 = 3
\]

Thus, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Given that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We multiply the time per page by the number of pages he reads:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the changes in the number of guests step by step.

1. Initially, the hotel was fully booked with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains:
   \[
   76
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 new guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   76 + 30 = 106
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, increasing the number of guests to:
   \[
   106 + 7 = 113
   \]

Thus, the hotel now has 113 guests.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he mines twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he mines 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days:**
   - In 30 days, 40 dwarves mine \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds of ore.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost. 

First, let's look at the given packages:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.

We can see that the cost per sandwich is consistent across these two packages:
- For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.
- For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.50. Therefore, for 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two further scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
       - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
       - Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
     - Total probability of not turning in homework: 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he lost by not working, and then determine how long it will take him to earn this amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the income lost by not working:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year.

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time required = Total cost / Net additional income = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of each piece of fabric is:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

The width of each piece of fabric is:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) × 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
80 square feet (area of one piece) × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their summer growth, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for consistency.

1. Convert Xavier's initial height from feet to inches:
   - Xavier was 4 feet tall.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches.
   - Therefore, 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

2. Add the growth to Xavier's initial height:
   - Xavier grew 3 inches.
   - Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

3. Cole's initial height was already given in inches:
   - Cole was 50 inches tall.

4. Add the growth to Cole's initial height:
   - Cole grew 2 inches.
   - Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

5. Calculate the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \). According to the problem, the second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars, and the third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day they worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by all painters.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

First, calculate the total number of days:
- 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Next, determine the fraction of a day they worked each day:
- They worked 3/8 of a day each day.

Convert the fraction of a day to hours:
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 3/8 of a day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Calculate the total hours worked by all painters:
- Total hours per day for all painters = 9 hours
- Total hours for 21 days = 9 * 21 = 189 hours

Finally, divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked:
- Number of painters = 4
- Hours per painter = 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, which means each year the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ V = P \times (1 - r)^n \]
where:
- \( V \) is the value after \( n \) years,
- \( P \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( n = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ V = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ V \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we first need to calculate the number of books in each language.

1. **Total number of books**: 50
2. **Number of English books**: Half of the total books are in English.
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
3. **Number of German books**: 10% of the total books are in German.
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]
4. **Number of Spanish books**: The remaining books are in Spanish. We can find this by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books.
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of Spanish books is 20.

"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year after his accident, we first need to calculate the new monthly cost of the insurance. The normal cost is $120 a month, and since he had an accident, the cost is 60% more than normal.

First, calculate the increase in cost due to the accident:
\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Next, add this increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
\[ \text{New Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Thus, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza had 8 slices.
   - There were 4 pizzas.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

"To solve this problem, let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the times spent by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

   - Therefore, the total cost for 15 roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

2. **Determine the amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five 5 dollar bills, which totals 5 * $5 = $25.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny receives:**
   - The change is the total amount of money Jenny has minus the cost of the roses.
   - Change = $25 - $21 = $4.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - The number of quarters in $4 is $4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the total time from when he arrives at the station until the fourth train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves 30 minutes after Paul arrives.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves 30 minutes after Paul arrives, so the second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul arrives.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves 65 minutes after Paul arrives, so the third train arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves 125 minutes after Paul arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves 125 minutes after Paul arrives, so the fourth train arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul arrives.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs.

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Total toothpicks saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

2. Determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach 200:
   - Total toothpicks needed = 200.
   - Toothpicks already saved = 120.
   - Toothpicks still needed = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - Weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

Thus, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To determine Sheila's new credit card balance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the discounted price of the frying pan and the set of towels.
4. Add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance.

Let's break it down:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, calculate the discounted prices:
- Frying pan: 20% off $20.00
  - Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
  - Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

- Set of towels: 10% off $30.00
  - Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
  - Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, add the discounted prices to the remaining balance:
- Remaining balance after return: $70.00
- Total of new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
- New balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

Therefore, Sheila's new credit card balance is $113.00.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement period, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and how much she can save each year.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement income needed:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Current annual salary: $100,000
   - Annual retirement income needed: \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \)

2. **Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement savings needed: \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \)

3. **Calculate the annual savings:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Annual savings: \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \)

4. **Determine the number of years needed to save the total amount:**
   - Total savings needed: $800,000
   - Annual savings: $20,000
   - Number of years needed: \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \)

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her 20-year retirement.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. 

\[ \text{Length of each of the 4 parts} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, each of these 25 cm parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. 

\[ \text{Length of each of the 5 parts} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To solve for \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, we know the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 240 of these students are boys, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

There are three women wearing 4-inch heels and three women wearing 2-inch heels. 

First, calculate the total height of the 4-inch heels:
3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches

Next, calculate the total height of the 2-inch heels:
3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches

Now, add the total heights together:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by the number of women:
18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and the total miles she plans to hike each day.

June has 30 days. Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles she plans to hike each day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June with her current plan:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The additional miles she needs to hike are:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to reach his parents' house.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - One-way distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Since John makes a round trip, the total distance for one visit is twice the one-way distance.
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for the month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total monthly distance = 2 visits × 280 miles per visit = 560 miles

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

First, let's calculate the production of the two workers who produce 6 toys per hour:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys} \]

Next, let's calculate the production of the two workers who produce 4 toys per hour:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Now, let's add the production of these four workers:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all five workers during the 10-hour shift is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find the production rate of the fifth worker per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is 105 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes, we can write:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} = v \times 40 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we know that her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the speed on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can determine the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob initially has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of marbles Bob has:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs.
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Step 2: Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
A 10% discount on $40.00 is:
\[ 10\% \times \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]
Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Step 3: Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.
Each pack contains 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs.
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]
The cost per bagel is:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \]

Thus, the cost per bagel after the discount is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed to make a certain number of scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
   - \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

   So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}
     \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women initially on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 parts (5 parts men + 9 parts women), there are 84 passengers in total. 

First, we calculate the value of one part:
\[ \text{Total parts} = 5 + 9 = 14 \]
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Next, we find the number of men and women:
\[ \text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold individually per day:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers each day.
   - Each individual sunflower costs $2.
   - Number of individual sunflowers sold per day = \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets each day.
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of individual sunflowers sold per day + Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day.
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold over 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day \(\times\) 3.

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]
   Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces:
   \[
   1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year from year 5 to year 10:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[

"Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as \( R \), \( B \), and \( Y \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   R = 4B
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   B = Y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   R + B + Y = 37
   \]

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[
4B + B + Y = 37
\]
\[
5B + Y = 37
\]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
\]
\[
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
\]
\[
6Y - 35 = 37
\]
\[
6Y = 72
\]
\[
Y = 12
\]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[
B = Y - 7
\]
\[
B = 12 - 7
\]
\[
B = 5
\]

Finally, substitute \( B = 5 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[
R = 4B
\]
\[
R = 4 \times 5
\]
\[
R = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Amount Left in Ronnie's Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The amount left in Ronnie's money is \(2\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, let's determine how much of the mural is yellow:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is:
  \[
  \frac{12 \text{ pints}}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how much paint is used for the remaining colors (red, white, and purple):
- The remaining half of the mural is:
  \[
  12 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
  \]

Since the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple:
- The amount of paint used for each of these colors is:
  \[
  \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
  \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of each part and then sum them up.

1. **Bedrooms**: Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
   \[
   20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
   \[
   4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Living Room**: The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. Therefore, the area of the living room is:
   \[
   5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Rest of the House**: The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

4. **Total Area**: To find the total area of the house, we sum the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She counts double the number from Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She counts double the number from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She counts double the number from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She counts double the number from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of puffs counted each day:

\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pods are in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods. 

20% of 100 pods is:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12, and it contains 120 pods. To find out how many pods you get per dollar, we divide the number of pods by the cost:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ pods per dollar} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: 5 inches
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Chalk Remaining After Monday**:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher uses each day after Monday, and how many days it will take for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches.

4. **Chalk Used Each Day After Monday**: 20% of the remaining chalk
   \[
   \text{Chalk Used Each Day} = 0.20 \times \text{Remaining Chalk}
   \]

5. **Chalk Remaining Each Day**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Chalk} = \text{Previous Day's Remaining Chalk} - \text{Chalk Used Each Day}
   \]

We will calculate the remaining chalk day by day until it is less than 2 inches.

**Day 1 (Tuesday)**:
\[
\text{Chalk Used} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining Chalk} = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches}

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 (capped)

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 (total fixed)

Next, we calculate the percentage of James' total teeth that the dentist fixes. James has 30 teeth, so the percentage is:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

Thus, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is 50%.

"To determine the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.
The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$14,000 \]

Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that was returned.
2/5 of the milk purchased had passed the expiry date.
\[ \text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.
The refund is calculated by multiplying the amount of returned milk by the cost per gallon.
\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5,600 \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of \$5,600.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her friends and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs**: Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour.
2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

Therefore, the net rate of snowball accumulation per hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

We need to find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Using the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour, we can set up the equation:
\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

4. **End of the Third Day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Now, let's determine the initial number of bandages they started with. We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + \text{Total ordered} - \text{Total used} = 78 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 150 - 91 = 78 \]

Solving for the initial bandages:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 59 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 59 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 19 \]

Thus, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut based on the length of hair removed and add the cost of the hair color.

1. **Cost of the hair color**: The cost for the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. **Cost of the haircut**: The haircut costs $30 per inch of hair cut. May's hair was reduced from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is:
   \[
   10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]
   The cost for the haircut is:
   \[
   2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost**: The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
   \[
   40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, calculate her weekly earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, which totals:
  \[
  7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week}
  \]
- Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
  \[
  45 \text{ hours/week} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 67.5 \text{ dollars/week}
  \]

Next, calculate her monthly earnings from her hourly wage:
- There are 4 weeks in April, so her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
  \[
  67.5 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 270 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week, and since there are 4 weeks in April, her total attendance bonus is:
  \[
  10 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 40 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, add her monthly earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
\[
270 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 310 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jen will receive:
\[
310

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he completed the task and then sum these amounts.

1. Laundry: $3.00 for 1 time = $3.00
2. Cleaning his room: $1.50 for 1 time = $1.50
3. Taking the trash out: $0.75 for 2 times = $1.50
4. Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 for 6 times = $3.00

Now, we add these amounts together:
$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) = $9.00

Therefore, Jason earned $9.00 in the two-week period.

"To solve this problem, we start by determining the amount of blood in one shark. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We do this by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant at different times of the day and then sum these numbers.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. This means \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (in the morning) entered the restaurant. This means \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered.

Now, we sum all these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is:

320"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
2. Each pack contains 5 pens, so the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

3. She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
   \]

4. Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

5. To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens:
   \[
   25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Number of Bottles of Cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - Therefore, the number of bottles of cognac is:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Cost per Bottle of Cognac:**
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
     \[
     60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost of Cognac:**
   - The total cost for 20 bottles of cognac is:
     \[
     20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost of Everything:**
   - The total cost of everything John buys is the sum of the cost of scotch and the cost of cognac:
     \[
     600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Mattison's height**: 60 inches.
2. **Height of the house**: 7 times Mattison's height.
   \[
   \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Height of the first floor ceiling**: 3 times Mattison's height.
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor ceiling} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

The height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors. We already know the height of the first floor ceiling, which is the height from the ground to the ceiling of the first floor. To find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we subtract the height of the first floor ceiling from the total height of the house.

4. **Height from the second floor's floor to the roof**:
   \[
   \text{Height from the second floor's floor to the roof} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor ceiling}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Height from the second floor's floor to the roof} = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches}

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance is the total distance walked by all dogs divided by the number of dogs. 

Given:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.
- The average distance walked by the dogs is 3 miles per day.
- There are 4 dogs in total.

Let \( x \) be the distance the fourth dog needs to walk. The total distance walked by all dogs is the sum of the distances each dog walks:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

The average distance is given by:
\[ \frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( x \):

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a few steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the loan John gets, which is 40% of the value of his house.
2. Determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.
3. Subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover.

Let's start with step 1:
- The value of John's house is $250,000.
- The loan amount is 40% of $250,000.
- \( 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \).

So, John gets a loan of $100,000.

Next, step 2:
- John uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts.
- \( 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \).

So, John uses $60,000 to pay off his debts.

Finally, step 3:
- The amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is the total loan amount minus the amount used to pay off debts.
- \( 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \).

Therefore, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000.

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at \(\frac{11}{8}\) of the price she bought them for. 

The price she bought the magazines for is $72. Therefore, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
\]

To simplify this, we can multiply 72 by 11 and then divide by 8:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} = 99
\]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Thus, Trinity's profit is:
\[

   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed from all settings:
\[ 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of jelly beans:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Initial Cost and Visits:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years initially.

   The total cost for the first 5 years is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 5 years} = 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} \times \$2/\text{visit} = 3 \times 5 \times 2 = \$30
   \]

2. **Cost After Price Increase:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the new cost is 250% of the original cost.
   - The new cost of one visit is:
   \[
   \text{New cost} = \$2 \times 2.5 = \$5
   \]
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.

   The total cost for the next 3 years is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 3 years} = 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} \times \$5/\text{visit} = 3 \times 3 \times 5 = \$45

"To determine how long it will take for all the students to try the escape room, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th).
2. Each grade has 10 students who qualify to try the escape room.
3. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.
4. Each group of 8 students takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room.

First, calculate the total number of students who will try the escape room:
\[ 4 \text{ grades} \times 10 \text{ students/grade} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, determine how many groups of 8 students are needed:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room, the total time required for all groups is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to calculate how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds required for 80 meatballs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

     \]

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]

5. **Substitute the expression for \( b \) from step 2 into the equation from step 4:**
   \[
   c + (3c - 2) = 10
   \]

6. **Simplify and solve for \( c \):**
   \[
   c + 3c - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4c - 2 = 10

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Thus, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"To determine the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

1. **Cost of the radiator:**
   - Original price: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Price after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of the mechanic's labor:**
   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of the mechanic's labor
   - Total cost = \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

230"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To determine how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices.
