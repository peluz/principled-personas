"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]

2. Calculate the new value of the house:
   \[
   \text{New value} = \text{Original value} + \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including repairs:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Original purchase price} + \text{Cost of repairs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

4. Calculate the profit:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
   \]

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total feed needed per day is:
   \[
   20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   The total feed given by the afternoon is:
   \[
   15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   The total feed needed for the day is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given. Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
   \[
   60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining time (4 hours total - 2.5 hours already spent = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Journey:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay**: Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Pay**: Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12/hour
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings**: Sum of regular pay and overtime pay.
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Cost**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit per year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]
5. **Break-even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net annual profit:
   \[
   \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before selling at the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

2. Before selling at the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners, which is after selling 2 more to the red house. Therefore, before selling to the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

3. The 12 vacuum cleaners represent the amount left after selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If 12 is two-thirds of the original amount (since she sold a third at the green house), then the original amount is 12 * (3/2) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Taken} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount. If \( P \) is the original price, then the price Kyle paid is 75% of \( P \) (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

The equation is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Calculating the right side:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples:

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- The 5 packs of milk cost 5 * $3 = $15.
- The 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total cost of these items:

$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:

$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of other items) = $17.

Now, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she bought:

$17 / $8.50 (cost per box of pizza) = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. Let's denote Darrell's age by \(7x\) and Allen's age by \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solve for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to determine what each friend guessed.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S = 40 \)), we can find the number of gold coins (\( G \)):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 1 point more than the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both periods to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Total points scored: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. After selling them, he uses the money to buy video games and has $5 left over. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine if he sold all of them or not.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games he buys:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is:
$160 (cost of video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

Since the total amount of money John had after selling his lego sets is $195 and he spent $165, this means he did indeed sell all his lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
0

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week. According to the problem, John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. 

- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Third day: 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours

Now, let's add up the total time:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week. To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed \(\times\) time spent running
   - Distance running = \( 6 \) miles per hour \(\times\) 2 hours = 12 miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed \(\times\) time spent walking
   - Distance walking = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour \(\times\) 4 hours = 6 miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking
   - Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the increased throwing distance and then subtract the dragon's flame reach.

1. Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet.
2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal distance.
3. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is \( 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \).
4. The dragon's flame reach is 1000 feet.

To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We know that one serving of chips is 250 calories and the 300g bag has 5 servings. Therefore, each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since 250 calories are in 60g of chips, we can calculate how many grams of chips 200 calories would be:

(200 calories / 250 calories) * 60g = 48g

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies and the total revenue from selling the candles, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she originally had from the total to find out how many were in the package.

Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using 220, so the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:

220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243 (total before using)

Candice originally had 80 Post-it notes in her purse, so the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

243 (total before using) - 80 (originally had) = 163 (in the package)

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to get the total amount spent on ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he covers is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes him to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 pounds * (2 toys/pound) = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of money she received over the 8 weeks from her final total.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has $100. This total includes her initial amount plus the $40 she received over the 8 weeks. To find her initial amount, we subtract the $40 from the final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money Judy makes by multiplying the total number of students by the charge per student.

First, let's find the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Next, let's calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, that's 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Judy makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, that's 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

Therefore, Judy makes $7,425.00 in one week.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level, starting from the top and working our way down.

Given that the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, to find the average square footage, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{\text{Level 1} + \text{Level 2} + \text{Level 3} + \text{Level 4}}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{240}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average square footage} = 60 \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we know that each adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad. There are 20 adult dinosaurs, so the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, each child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, which is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]
There are 5 child dinosaurs, so the total amount of potato salad for the children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the amounts for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left in the line is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but has a soda with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day on Saturday and Sunday. So for the weekend, he drinks:

3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses

Adding the weekday and weekend totals together:

20 glasses (weekdays) + 6 glasses (weekends) = 26 glasses

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given rate of the fog's movement and the total distance it needs to cover.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes to cover 42 miles, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{42 \text{ miles} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]

\[ x = \frac{420 \text{ minutes}}{3} \]

\[ x = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Poppy starts with a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.
2. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is:
   \[ \frac{1000}{4} = 250 \]
   So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

3. After Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

4. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. A third of 750 is:
   \[ \frac{750}{3} = 250 \]
   So, her mom places 250 pieces.

5. After her mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total time he spent watching TV each night and then solve for the unknown.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) (30-minute episodes)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \).
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 40,000 + 16,000 \).
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \).
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \).
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary.

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in the time he had for each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \( 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \).

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

For the second test:
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \( 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \).

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote:
- The number of queens as \( Q \).
- The number of baby bees as \( B \).
- The number of worker bees as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first identify which items are nonfood and then apply the 10% tax to those items. The food items are milk and eggs, and the nonfood items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the nonfood items:
10% of $10 = $1

The total cost including tax is the sum of the cost of food items, the cost of nonfood items, and the tax on nonfood items:
Total cost = $5 (food) + $10 (nonfood) + $1 (tax) = $16

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests occur in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples per harvest
John has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare yields 100 pineapples.
Total pineapples per harvest = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year.
Number of harvests in a year = 12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return to the hive. This means \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive. This means \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. The bees that left and hadn't returned are the 60 bees that left in the third 6-hour period, minus the 15 bees that had already returned. So, \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance to home in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance to home in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time to get home:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time to get home:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time, which is how long the winner will be waiting, is:

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar).

500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to the original number. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Final fries left:** 5 fries.
2. **Ants carried off 1 fry:** Before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:** If the raccoon stole two-thirds, then one-third was left. So, the 6 fries represent one-third of the fries before the raccoon took them. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(6 \times 3 = 18\) fries.
4. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:** The pigeons ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. So, before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:** Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. Therefore, before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. **Dave ate 14 fries:** Before Dave, there were \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total class hours for the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

\[ \text{Blake's total distance} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).

\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 1 \times 200 \text{ yards} + 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} \]
\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 200 \text{ yards} + 2720 \text{ yards} = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

**Difference in Distance:**
To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we subtract the total distance run by Kelly from the total distance run by Blake.

3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of the uniform:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

"To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then increase it by 50%.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate the 50% increase on the total minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

3. Calculate the total monthly payment with the 50% increase:
   Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

4. Calculate the total annual payment:
   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

"To determine the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Billy will take to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and then their total costs, including the cost of lemons.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let's denote the total revenue as \( R \) and the total cost as \( C \).
   - The profit formula is: \( \text{Profit} = R - C \).
   - Given that the profit is $25, we have: \( 25 = R - C \).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, totaling $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total cost \( C \) is then \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - The revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - The total revenue \( R \) from \( G \) gallons is \( 10G \).

4. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( R \) and \( C \) into the profit equation: \( 25 = 10G - 5G \).
   - Simplify the equation: \( 25 = 5G \).
   - Solve for \( G \): \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down Zaid's expenses and calculate the remaining amount step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to family} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours at the same rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( C \).

Given:
\[ 200 = 5C \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses as follows:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

4. **Solve for \( M \):**
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   \[
   M = 19 + 2
   \]
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

5. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).
   \[
   \text{Jean's age} = 21 + 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first event is 2 times more likely than the second event.
   - To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
     \[
     (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

Thus, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. **Rats**: There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. **Hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
3. **Rabbits**: 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
4. **Total straw distributed**: 160 pieces.

First, calculate the total straw used for the hamsters and rabbits:

- **Hamsters**: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw.
- **Rabbits**: 20 pieces of straw.

So, the total straw used for hamsters and rabbits is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Next, subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total straw to find out how much straw is used for the rats:
\[ 160 - 70 = 90 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total straw used for rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:
\[ \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost per bag to the trader**: The trader buys each bag for $20 and it costs $2 to transport each bag, so the total cost per bag is:
   \[
   20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars per bag}
   \]

2. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.

3. **Profit per bag**: The profit made on each bag is the selling price minus the total cost per bag:
   \[
   30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars per bag}
   \]

4. **Total profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400.

5. **Number of bags sold**: To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: $20.25 for 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees Tom plants each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees.

Step 1: Net number of trees planted each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees he adds each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, and adding 8 trees each year for 10 years, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Final number of trees
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and then calculate the earnings from each publisher.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, we get:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch**: He ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \(7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices}\)

2. **Omelets for breakfast**: He ate omelets 3 days, using 1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\)

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner**: He used 8 slices of cheese in one big dish.
   - Total cheese for macaroni and cheese: \(8 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
- Total cheese used: \(14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices}\)

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores.
3. Determine the required score on the sixth test.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores:
- The formula for the average is: \(\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{\text{Number of Tests}}\)
- We want the average to be 93 over 5 tests, so:
  \[
  93 = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{5}
  \]
- Solving for Total Points:
  \[
  \text{Total Points} = 93 \times 5 = 465
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many points Brinley has from the four highest scores of the first five tests:
- The four highest scores are: 89, 92, 100, 86
- Sum of these scores:
  \[
  89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367
  \]

To find the required score on the sixth test, we need the total points from the five highest scores to be 465:
- Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
- The total points from the five highest scores will be:
  \[
  367 + x
  \]
- We need this to equal 465:
  \[
  367 + x = 465
  \]
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 465 - 367 = 98
  \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance he rode in the first four weeks and the distance he rode in the following three weeks.

1. For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total distance per week = 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride = 125 kilometers/week.
- Total distance for four weeks = 125 kilometers/week * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers.

2. For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total distance per week = 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride = 120 kilometers/week.
- Total distance for three weeks = 120 kilometers/week * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers.

Adding the distances from both periods gives us the total distance:
- Total distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40 grams/chocolate bar = 1000 grams

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20 grams/candied apple = 1600 grams

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000 grams (chocolate bars) + 1600 grams (candied apples) = 2600 grams

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought after all three days, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we add up the cakes bought on each day to find the total:

- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes bought = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost for 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
   - Cost per cup = $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
2 pairs * $20/pair = $40

Adding the cost of the jacket:
$30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs is:
$70 - $10 = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
4 times * $5/time = $20

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30

The remaining amount she needs after babysitting is:
$70 (total cost) - $30 (savings + babysitting) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$40 / $4/lawn = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The daily egg production can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length (L) = 6 miles
- Width (W) = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance Gary walks is 15 miles. To find out how long it takes him to walk this distance, we use the formula for time (T), which is:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour, we can calculate the time:

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( x \).

The total number of customers over the three days can be expressed as:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of payments, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, including the 10% interest.

1. Calculate the total amount to be repaid:
   - Principal amount: $2000
   - Interest: 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200
   - Total amount to be repaid: $2000 + $200 = $2200

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Total payments over 12 months: $165 * 12 = $1980

3. Determine the remaining balance after 12 months:
   - Total amount owed: $2200
   - Total amount paid: $1980
   - Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's current age.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is twice Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by the four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, calculate how many points Yuri scored:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, calculate how many points Brianna scored:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points scored by the three: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)
- Points scored by Jojo: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:

"First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen he made.

25 + 5 + 1 = 31

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pen pals Mike is currently writing to:
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped writing to 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he is now writing to \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. Determine the number of letters Mike receives each week:
   - Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.

3. Calculate the total number of pages Mike receives each week:
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages a week.

4. Determine the number of pages Mike writes in response:
   - Mike responds to each letter with a letter of the same length.
   - Therefore, he writes \(30\) pages a week in response.

5. Calculate the total time Mike spends writing each week:
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent writing is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

6. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. So, after Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \((9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\).

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[7 + x = 27\]
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information and setting up the equations based on the given conditions.

1. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
3. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \( f \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Step 1: Daily cost
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours each day.
Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500

Step 2: Weekly cost
The makeup is required 4 times a week.
Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000

Step 3: Total cost for 5 weeks
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
Total cost = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000

Step 4: Apply the 10% discount
The makeup artist gives a 10% discount.
Discount = 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000

Final cost after discount
Final cost = Total cost - Discount = $30000 - $3000 = $27000

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of Mitchel's 30 slides, we calculate:

30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

30 - 9 = 21

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows. This means there are a total of:
   \[
   10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
   \]

2. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. Since there are 20 stalls, each stall will receive:
   \[
   \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall}

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. 

\[ \text{Number of 10-foot sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

\[ \text{Total weight before termites} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate, which is 30% of the total weight:

\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten by termites} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree:

     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:**
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies:

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body, so it takes \(900 / 10 = 90\) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the entire sweater is 1800.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[ 630 \text{ stitches} / 2 = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, let's break down the information given:

1. **Solo Song**: The song has 54 lines, and all of these lines are his to memorize.
2. **First Scene**: The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines from the first scene.
3. **Second Scene**: The second scene has six more lines than the song, which is \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines to memorize: \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, we add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows to find the total number of stars accounted for:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars per row:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them:

"To determine how much Susan earns, we first need to calculate the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

She takes a half-hour pause, so the actual working time is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 per interval, her total earnings are:

Next, we need to find out how many books were sold in total over the three years. We know there are 50 unsold books out of the original 250, so the total number of books sold is:

\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books} \]

We already know the number of books sold in the first and third years, so we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold:

\[ 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \text{ books} \]

Now, to find out how much money she earned in the second year, we multiply the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book:

\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:

"To calculate Watson's earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus, given that the company performed well for the entire month.

1. **Calculate the weekly earnings from hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours per week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week
   - Earnings from hourly wage per week = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

2. **Calculate the total weekly earnings including the bonus:**
   - Since the company performed well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
   - Total weekly earnings = $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week

3. **Determine the number of weeks in April:**
   - April typically has 4 weeks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings for April = 4 weeks * $800/week = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total loaves produced each day**: 60 loaves.
2. **Loaves sold in the morning**: Two-thirds of the total loaves.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. **Loaves remaining after the morning sales**:
   \[
   \text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. **Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening**: Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. **Loaves sold in the afternoon**:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses in one week, we divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks:
   \[
   \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

2. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss:**
   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy loses:
   \[
   \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we divide the total weight loss by Sandy's weekly weight loss:
   \[
   \text{Time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over a period of fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **New Arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ new arms}
     \]

2. **New Legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ new legs}
     \]

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ new arms} + 3 \text{ new legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.
2. Multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight.

First, let's determine the total number of marbles:

- Solomon initially had 50 marbles.
- He bought 20 more marbles from Johanna, so he now has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.
- His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.
- Adding the marbles from his father, Solomon now has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the marbles:

- Each marble weighs 2 kg.
- Therefore, the total weight of 78 marbles is \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) kg.

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
Initial cost = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

**Step 2: Value after the first year's increase**
The stock price increases by 50%.
Increase = 50% of $8 = 0.50 * $8 = $4
New price per share after the first year = $8 + $4 = $12
Total value after the first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

**Step 3: Value after the second year's decrease**
The stock price decreases by 25%.
Decrease = 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New price per share after the second year = $12 - $3 = $9
Total value after the second year = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72.

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, which is 10 less than each of the other groups, will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( H = 2C \) (twice as many chickens as cows)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( C \):

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals based on the information provided:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself, we add the weights together:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

- **Sunday:** The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, let's add up the net sales for all three days:

- Total pairs sold = \(14\) (Friday) + \(28\) (Saturday) + \(8\) (Sunday) = \(50\) pairs.

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of the functioning pieces of equipment after the faulty ones have been returned.

1. First, calculate the value of the faulty equipment:
   - 40% of the total equipment is faulty.
   - 40% of $400,000 = 0.40 * $400,000 = $160,000.

2. Next, calculate the value of the functioning equipment:
   - The total value of the equipment is $400,000.
   - Subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value to get the value of the functioning equipment.
   - $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the amount of milk from the first half of the sheep.
2. Calculate the amount of milk from the second half of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep in total. Half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk per sheep. So, the total milk from the first half is:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

From the second half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk per sheep. So, the total milk from the second half is:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Now, we add the milk from both halves to get the total amount of milk collected every day:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add this to the principal to find the total amount to be repaid. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. Since Karan is borrowing for five months, we need to find the interest for this period.

   \[
   \text{Annual interest rate} = 10\% = 0.10
   \]

   \[
   \text{Monthly interest rate} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.008333

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
3. Calculate the total profit by subtracting the cost of supplies from the total revenue.
4. Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.
5. Calculate the profit per hour.

**Step 1: Total number of cups of lemonade**
Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups.
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Total revenue from selling all the lemonade**
Each cup is sold for $1.
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

**Step 3: Total profit**
The cost of supplies is $18.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold 3/5 of his land, then he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first. Then we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26 girls

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing, and half of them can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls performing = 26 / 2 = 13 girls

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Number of people who sang = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Number of people who sang = 13 + 3 = 16

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix**: $10 per month.
2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**:
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - With a 20% discount for bundling, the cost of each service is reduced by 20%.
   - The discount amount for each service is $10 * 20% = $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of each service after the discount is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.
   - Since Tim is getting both Hulu and Disney Plus, the total cost for both services is $8 + $8 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services**:
   - Netflix: $10 per month
   - Hulu and Disney Plus: $16 per month
   - Total: $10 + $16 = $26 per month

4. **Savings**:
   - Cost of cable package: $60 per month
   - Cost of streaming services: $26 per month
   - Savings: $60 - $26 = $34 per month

Therefore, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing her song, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Next, we add up all the time spent on these activities to get the total work time:
Total work time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day.

2. Convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatt-hours (kWh):
   - 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours.
   - Daily energy consumption in kWh = 7200 watt-hours/day / 1000 = 7.2 kWh/day.

3. Calculate the energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day:
   - New usage time = 8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption in kWh = 2700 watt-hours/day / 1000 = 2.7 kWh/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = Original daily consumption - New daily consumption.
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kWh/day - 2.7 kWh/day = 4.5 kWh/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = Daily energy savings * 30 days.
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

Therefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

- Cost of meat: \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \)
- Cost of cheese: \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \)

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total amount spent:

- Total cost: \( \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \)

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **After Buying More Cannolis:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **New Quantity of Corns:**
   - Allan now has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis, the number of corns is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total of corns and cannolis is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 5,000 steps. Additionally, he did another 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend. This brings the total number of steps he has taken so far to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before the jog, he had 2,000 more steps to go to reach 10,000. Therefore, the number of steps he had taken before the jog was 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the number of steps he had taken before the jog from the number of steps he had taken after the jog (which is 8,000 steps). So, the number of steps taken during the jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we'll determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs to account for the 10 minutes it takes to get to the airport, so the total time he needs to allocate for reading and traveling is:

30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, we can calculate how many minutes early he will be:

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments for both months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month for simplicity)

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees who continued working in June:
\[ 40 \, \text{employees} \times \frac{3}{4} = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 4: Sum the payments for both months.**

Total payment for May and June:
\[ 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of Purchases:**
   - Total cost for taffy: $4.50
   - Total cost for seashells: $1.50
   - Total cost for magnets: $1.00
   - Total cost of all purchases: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - She spent $7.00.
   - Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- 80% of $1200 is $1200 * 0.80 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.

"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon will eat in 30 days.
   - Shannon eats 2 cookies a night.
   - Over 30 days, she will eat \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cookies.

2. Determine how many dozens of cookies are needed.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12.
   - \(60 \div 12 = 5\) dozens.

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of madeleine cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. We know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them will explode. Out of the candles that are more dangerous (the 1% that will explode), 5% also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find out how many candles will explode:

1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 exploding candles also smell like wet dog:

5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

1. Calculate the discount per blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is 30% of $20.
   - \( 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price per blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost is the discounted price per blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
   - \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) dollars.

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Joanne's apples} + \text{Sister's apples} = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- Each camel has 1 head and 2 humps.
- Each dromedary has 1 head and 1 hump.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ D = 360 - 304 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \)
   - Total for the next 2 days: 240 km

3. **Next 1 day**: He wasn't traveling at all.
   - Total for this day: 0 km

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \)

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker.

We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, to find the size of Zack's locker, we can multiply the size of Peter's locker by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \text{Peter's locker size} \times 4 = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = \text{Zack's locker size} \times 2 = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after a $4 savings, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after a $2 savings, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs of each item she ordered:

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup:
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 25\% \times \text{Cost of bagel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5

   So, the soup costs $5.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find the cost of the cake:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
   \]
   So, the cake costs $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of cake} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount he made by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.
4. Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards he sold represent the remaining 2/3 of his collection.
5. To find the total number of cards he started with, we can set up the equation: 2/3 * total cards = 100.
6. Solving for the total number of cards: total cards = 100 / (2/3) = 100 * (3/2) = 150.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means:
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - These 18 guests would each get 2 hotdogs, totaling 36 hotdogs (18 guests * 2 hotdogs each).
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, totaling 18 hotdogs (18 guests * 1 hotdog each).

2. **Total Hotdogs Prepared**: Adding these together, the caterer prepared:
   - 36 hotdogs (for the 18 guests who get 2) + 18 hotdogs (for the 18 guests who get 1) = 54 hotdogs.

3. **Actual Scenario**: 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means:
   - Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 80 hotdogs.

4. **Shortfall Calculation**: The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, but 80 were needed. The shortfall is:
   - 80 hotdogs needed - 54 hotdogs prepared = 26 hotdogs.

5. **Guests Without Second Hotdog**: Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs and the shortfall is 26 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
   - 26 hotdogs / 1 hotdog per guest = 26 guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"Rory's cake originally weighs 20 ounces. When she cuts it into 8 pieces, each piece weighs:

20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so together they have:

2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

The remaining cake will weigh the original weight minus the weight of the pieces that were eaten:

20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Determine the time difference needed for Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - Wayne needs to arrive at the theater at a specific time, say \( T \).
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Calculate the total time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his travel time is 4 minutes).
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom. We are given the area of the room and the length in yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet, as the area is given in square feet and we need the perimeter in feet.

1 yard = 3 feet

Given:
- Length (L) = 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet
- Area (A) = 360 square feet

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = L \times W \]

Where \( W \) is the width of the room. We can solve for \( W \) using the given area and length:
\[ 360 = 9 \times W \]
\[ W = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ W = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter (P) of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2L + 2W \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times 9 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ P = 18 + 80 \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads

Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 beads (red) + 40 beads (clear) = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads

Total beads Margareth bought = 60 beads (blue) + 80 beads (red) = 140 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the total number of beads Elizabeth bought from the total number of beads Margareth bought:

140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket**: $20
2. **Cost of the Movie Ticket**: $12
3. **Cost of the Soda**: $3
4. **Savings**: $2

If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda was $2 less than the cost of the super ticket.

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The total cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

According to the problem, this total cost is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 20 - 2 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 18 \]

Solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 18 - 15 \]
\[ P = 3 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{3} \)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

Thus, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ \text{Volume} = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds.
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Each bag costs $12.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the potting soil is:

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide this total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

Next, we determine how many trips are needed to transport 4500 pounds of feed with a truck that can carry 2250 pounds at a time:
- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer needs exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings from the aluminum cans:
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- So, the weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

Next, let's calculate the weekly earnings from the plastic bottles:
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, the weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Now, let's add the weekly earnings from both cans and bottles to get the total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

Finally, to find the earnings for a four-week month, we multiply the total weekly earnings by 4:

First, calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 45 \) cents.
- Convert 45 cents to dollars: \( 45 \) cents = \( 0.45 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 50 \) cents.
- Convert 50 cents to dollars: \( 50 \) cents = \( 0.50 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is \( 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \) dollar.
- The final cost for Kelly is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, calculate how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Kelly paid \( 9 \) dollars.
- Becky paid \( 8 \) dollars.

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms, let's break down the items per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. **Towels**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total items per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 items

For 80 rooms, the total number of items is:
15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes. So, he now has:
   200 + 10 = 210 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 shoes. So, he now has:
   210 + 30 = 240 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 60 shoes. So, he now has:
   240 + 60 = 300 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, he now has:
   300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Therefore, on Sunday, Frank will have 120 shoes.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the shark's length and the remoras' lengths to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet and the remoras' lengths in inches, we will convert the shark's length to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.
2. Calculate the total length of the remoras.
3. Divide the total length of the remoras by the shark's length in inches to find the fraction of the shark's length that the remoras represent.
4. Convert this fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Shark's length in inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches
2. Total length of the remoras: 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches
3. Fraction of the shark's length that the remoras represent: 12 inches / 120 inches = 0.1
4. Convert the fraction to a percentage: 0.1 * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, the number of kids not allergic to anything is:

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the order they are stacked.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on the next level
- 2 cheerleaders on the next level
- 1 cheerleader at the top (the shortest one, 60"" tall)

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, the 10th cheerleader, who is 60"" tall, will be at the top.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the cheerleaders:
- 4 cheerleaders at 64"" each: \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches
- 3 cheerleaders at 64"" each: \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches
- 2 cheerleaders at 64"" each: \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches
- 1 cheerleader at 60"" tall: \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches

Total height in inches:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we know David found 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we need to calculate the number of gifts for each group of friends and then add the extra gifts she decided to buy.

First, for the 2 friends who each want 5 gifts:
2 friends * 5 gifts per friend = 10 gifts

Next, for the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
3 friends * 2 gifts per friend = 6 gifts

Now, we add the 10 extra random gifts:
10 extra gifts

Adding all the gifts together:
10 gifts (for the first 2 friends) + 6 gifts (for the other 3 friends) + 10 extra gifts = 26 gifts

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the width of the rug:**
   - The chair is 3 feet wide.
   - The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
   - Therefore, the width of the rug is \(3 + 5 = 8\) feet.

2. **Determine the length of the couch:**
   - The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
   - Twice the width of the rug is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) feet.
   - Therefore, the length of the couch is \(16 + 2 = 18\) feet.

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs were strawberry.
3. One pack was grape, which cost $2.
4. One pack was green apple, which cost half as much as the grape pack, so it cost $1.
5. The total cost for all the gum was $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
\[ 2S = 4 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then determine the best combination within his budget.

1. **Cost and Yield of Each Type of Wood:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To maximize the number of sticks, Frederick should buy the type of wood that gives the most sticks per dollar.
   - Cost per stick for 2 x 4: \( \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{200 \text{ sticks}} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick} \)
   - Cost per stick for 2 x 8: \( \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{400 \text{ sticks}} = 0.015 \text{ dollars per stick} \)

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides more sticks per dollar, it is the cheaper option in terms of cost per stick.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Sticks:**
   - With $24, Frederick can buy \( \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{6 \text{ dollars per 2 x 8}} = 4 \) pieces of 2 x 8 wood.
   - Each 2 x 8 piece yields 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will yield \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day for her bus trips is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of a weekly bus pass is $20.00. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ 2.00 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cows on the farm**: The farm has 30 cows.
2. **Cows on the zoo**: The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Therefore, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
3. **Sheep on the zoo**: The zoo has 20 sheep.
4. **Sheep on the farm**: The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Therefore, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo:

- **Total animals on the farm**: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- **Total animals on the zoo**: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

Finally, the combined total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo is:

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal.
2. Calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Divide the total number of calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.**

- December 31st to January 1st: 1 day
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Adding these together: 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs.**

- 1 pound = 3500 calories
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.**

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Next, solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know the total amount Tom spent and the cost of one CD.

The total amount spent by Tom is $48, and the cost of one CD is $4. The cost of the headphone set can be calculated by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount spent:

Cost of headphone set = Total amount spent - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the amount he spent on the headphone set, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:

Number of additional CDs = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of additional CDs = $44 / $4
Number of additional CDs = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we can start by calculating the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week, and then add the extra hours from the weeks he worked out more.

1. If Josh worked out 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, the total would be:
   \( 4 \, \text{hours/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{hours} \)

2. However, there are two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each, which is 1 hour extra per week for two weeks:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. Since 21 people got off, one-third of 21 is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7

"To find out how much one monitor cost, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer cost $1,100.
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors:

Total cost of all items = Cost of computer + Cost of 2 monitors + Cost of printer
$2,400 = $1,100 + Cost of 2 monitors + $700

Now, we can solve for the cost of 2 monitors:

Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor would be:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, one monitor cost $300.

   - There are 20 kids in total, and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This can be expressed as: \( \text{Number of seashells brought by each girl} = 60 + 4 \times 60 \).

4. **Perform the calculation:**
   - \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \)
   - \( 60 + 240 = 300 \)

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To find out how old Anne is, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 years + 2 years
Anne's age = 8 years

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together. Let's break it down:

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, which is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses together:

31 mm (first book) + 50 mm (second book) + 45 mm (third book) + 62 mm (fourth book) = 188 mm

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month, we need to add up the vlogs she has already made and subtract that total from her goal.

Vlogs made in the first week: 18
Vlogs made in the second week: 21
Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Vlogs needed to reach the goal of 72: 72 - 54 = 18

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"To calculate how much you end up paying, you first need to determine the total amount including the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 is calculated as:
0.20 * $50 = $10

So, the total amount including the tip is:
$50 + $10 = $60

Since you are splitting the check evenly with your wife, you each pay half of the original bill, which is:
$50 / 2 = $25

However, you are paying the entire tip, which is $10. Therefore, the total amount you pay is:
$25 (half of the bill) + $10 (tip) = $35

$35"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Share**: The total amount of $18 is shared equally among 3 boys. Each boy gets:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Additions to the Eldest's Share**:
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Spending**:
   - The eldest boy spends $8 from his total:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Tripling the Amount**:
   - After spending, he triples the remaining amount:
     \[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   The first half of April has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.

3. **Set up the savings equation:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly target:**
   The total savings for the month should be $1125.
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   Since \( x = 25 \), the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and then subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:
- The cost of the apples: 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
- The cost of the oranges: 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
- The cost of the peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the change Verna received is $7.00.

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we first calculate the total earnings for each of them based on the number of tasks they completed and the amount they get per task.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task. Since he completed 20 tasks, his total earnings are:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny earns $0.5 per task. Since she also completed 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day: Since Jeff's work is 3 miles away, and he walks there and back, he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home. So, in one day, he walks a total of 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

2. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in a week: Since Jeff works 5 times a week, we multiply the distance he walks in one day by the number of days he works in a week. So, 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the phone tree. Each person calls 3 new people, and this process repeats for each subsequent round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are called.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are called.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount, then apply the 10% discount to the total.

1. Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
2. Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
3. Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00
4. Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Now, we add up these costs to get the total before the discount:
Total before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total:
Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Total after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The final amount Daniel has to spend is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ray's swimming time for 1 mile in warm water:**
   - When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
   - When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.
   - Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this time gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - If Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes, then for 3 miles, the time is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - If Ray swims 1 mile in 34 minutes, then for 3 miles, the time is \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

4. **Determine how much longer it takes to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water:**
   - The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know there are 7 buttons with two holes each. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is:
7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons

These 14 buttons each have four holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is:
14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun moves relative to the ground, taking into account the initial angle of the pyramid.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is already at 32 degrees from the ground, we add the 50 degrees to this initial angle to find the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours.

32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs.

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles needed:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles, so we need to determine how many packs are required:
20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"To determine how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

Finally, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
- Total pages in two weeks = \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals each of them scored and then sum these numbers.

Given:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.

First, let's find out how many goals Mark scored. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark:
\[ \text{Mark's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, let's find out how many goals Anna scored. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna:

"To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days in this period, and he spends an equal amount each day. The total amount of money he has is $70, and he will spend this equally over 7 days, so each day he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys each day is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ wooden action figures per day} \]

Over 4 days, the total number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of money he has left after buying the wooden action figures. He spends $10 per day for 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from his initial amount of $70, the remaining amount of money is:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. The amount he spends each day is still $10, so the number of plastic action figures he buys each day is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ plastic action figures per day} \]

Over 3 days, the total number of plastic action figures he buys is:

\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Finally, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, so the oven is overheating by 18 degrees.

The percentage increase can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is overheating by 4%. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to when her recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the set temperature that, when increased by 4%, results in 520 degrees.

Let \( x \) be the set temperature. The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ x \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost Pete if he buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

First, let's calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount:

- The original price for 1 box is $100.00.
- The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00.
- The discounted price per box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.
- For 2 boxes, the total cost is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Next, let's determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes:

- Each box contains 90 contacts.
- For 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact:

- The cost per contact is $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the cost per pair is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as follows:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R \): \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G \): \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R \): \( R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G \): \( G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed of the plane can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ruiz's production rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's production rate is \( \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

2. **Determine Marissa's production rate:**
   - Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

3. **Calculate the total production for 12 hours:**
   - Ruiz's production in 12 hours: \( 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Marissa's production in 12 hours: \( 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of chocolate made by both:**
   - Total production = Ruiz's production + Marissa's production
   - Total production = 720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1800.

"To solve this problem, let's break down Howard's spending over the three days and then calculate how much money he has left.

1. **Monday**: Howard spends $8.
2. **Tuesday**: He spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. **Wednesday**: He spends four times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up his total spending over the three days:
- Total spent = $8 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) + $64 (Wednesday) = $88.

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
- $100 - $88 = $12.

"To calculate Patrick's total earnings, we need to break down the sales into two parts and then sum the earnings from each part.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. The earnings for this period are calculated as follows:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours = $30.00

For the next two hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. The earnings for this period are:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12.00

Adding the earnings from both periods gives us the total earnings:
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo based on Jeremy's monthly driving distance and then determine how long it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity.

1. First, calculate the number of rotations per mile:
   - 725 rotations every 2 miles means 725 / 2 = 362.5 rotations per mile.

2. Next, calculate the total number of rotations per month:
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the number of rotations per month is 400 * 362.5 = 145,000 rotations.

3. Determine the total number of months the tire will last:
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, so the number of months the tire will last is 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months.

4. Convert the number of months into years:
   - 72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years.

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washes from the bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash.
   - If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes will be \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \) washes.

2. **Calculate the cost per wash:**
   - The total cost of the bottle is $24.00.
   - The cost per wash is \( \frac{24.00}{240} \).

3. **Convert the cost per wash to cents:**
   - \( \frac{24.00}{240} = 0.10 \) dollars per wash.
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, 0.10 dollars = 10 cents.

Therefore, the cost per pump of shampoo, when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, is 10 cents.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is:

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42 on the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the amounts of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the height requirement is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches. We can set up the equation:

40 inches (current height) + 2 inches/year * x years = 48 inches (required height)

Solving for x:

2 inches/year * x years = 48 inches - 40 inches
2 inches/year * x years = 8 inches
x years = 8 inches / 2 inches/year
x years = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.**
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to acquire the cars.**
The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per attended class over $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. The cost per class if he attends all is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per attended class will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per attended class does not exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per attended class is then:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. So, Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. If we let \(L\) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie's distance can be expressed as \(L + 3\).

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Solving for \(L\):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of one apple is:
$5.20 / 4 apples = $1.30 per apple

The cost of one orange is:
$3.30 / 3 oranges = $1.10 per orange

Now, we can calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
Cost of 5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he plans to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular hole can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

The volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = V \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through both the soil and the clay.

First, we calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig at half the speed through clay, which is 4 feet per hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Finally, we add the time to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2S + 3 \]

We are also told that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To solve for \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we'll convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is:
600 inches (final height) - 240 inches (initial height) = 360 inches

Now, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find the number of days:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one for each dog, so he now has 12 (current) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys, which is exactly the number of dogs he has.

Therefore, James needs a total of 21 toys.

"To determine how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps of the investments made by Dylan and Frances, and then calculate the remaining amount for Skyler.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   - Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount.
   - Total amount = $1200
   - Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \)

2. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
   - Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   - Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.
   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \)

4. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Remaining amount after Dylan's investment - Frances's investment
   - Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240

5. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after Dylan's and Frances's investments.
   - Skyler's investment = 240

Thus, Skyler's investment is $240.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has, which we'll call \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
3. We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( C + 7 = 68 \). Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 68 - 7 = 61 \).
4. Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Max has: \( C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \) cookies.
5. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \( 73 + 23 = 96 \) cookies.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies they all have together:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Adding these together: \( 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \).

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing each half of his lawn in the different modes and then sum these times.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

Adding the time spent in each mode:
- Time in turtle mode: 30 minutes
- Time in rabbit mode: 20 minutes

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R \), we can find \( T \):

\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the cost of the candies. We know that:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

The total cost of the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

This $1.20 is the total cost of the four candies. To find the cost of one candy, we divide by 4:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{4} = \$0.30 \]

Now we know:
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.
- Each candy costs $0.30.

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
- The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

- The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong. Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which means:

Neil's monthly savings = Rong's monthly savings + (2/5 * Rong's monthly savings)
Neil's monthly savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's monthly savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's monthly savings = 20 + 8
Neil's monthly savings = 28 coins

Now, we calculate the total savings for both Rong and Neil over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are 120 months.

Rong's total savings = 20 coins/month * 120 months
Rong's total savings = 2400 coins

Neil's total savings = 28 coins/month * 120 months
Neil's total savings = 3360 coins

The combined total savings of Rong and Neil after ten years is:

Total savings = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.

"To calculate the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits to get the total price of the crate:

   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money. We know that after 3 hours, they have raised $2100. 

The rate of fundraising per hour is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours in total they need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300. We can use the formula:
\[ \text{Total hours needed} = \frac{\text{Total goal}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{6300}{700} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, the additional hours needed are:
\[ \text{Additional hours needed} = 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

However, the question asks for the total hours they have to fundraise to reach their goal, which is 9 hours.

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for all purposes, which is 40%.
2. Calculate the percentage of the city's water use that is for industrial purposes, which is 80% of the 40%.
3. Subtract the industrial water use from the total city water use to find the non-industrial water use.

Let's do the calculations:

- Industrial water use: 80% of 40% = 0.80 * 40% = 32%
- Non-industrial water use: 40% (total city use) - 32% (industrial use) = 8%

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then determine how much of each can be produced in 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- The production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- The production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production for each type of ice cream over 48 hours:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
- Total quarts = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we first need to calculate the total cost of each type of item before the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

1. Cost of croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
2. Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
3. Cost of mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
4. Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add these amounts to get the total before the discount:

Total before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final total:

Total after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is:

$45.00"
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal:
- Erin has $6.00.
- Each scoop costs $1.50.
- Number of scoops she can buy = $6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops.

Now, let's apply the deal:
- For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free.
- With 4 scoops, she can get 2 sets of 2 scoops, which means she gets 2 free scoops.

So, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
- 4 scoops (bought) + 2 scoops (free) = 6 scoops.

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

She dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (since she dances a total of 5 minutes and her arms are raised for 2 of those minutes).

For the right foot:
\[ 300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps} \]

For the left foot:
\[ 250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised:

1. Clara has 20 books.
2. Clara has two times as many books as Steven. Therefore, if we let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has, then:
   \[
   2S = 20
   \]
   Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   So, Steven has 10 books.

3. Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, if Alice has \( A \) books, then:
   \[
   A = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
   \]
   So, Alice has 16 books.

4. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
   \[
   20 - 16 = 4
   \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

"To find out how many wheels will be left after Henry assembles all the toys, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Henry has 57 cars to assemble.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Henry has 73 motorcycles to assemble.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels needed = \( 228 + 146 = 374 \) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = \( 650 - 374 = 276 \).

"To calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we need to break down the costs based on the different categories of movies he has.

1. **Movies in Series:**
   - A third of the 600 movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - Cost of these movies: Since he can get these for $6 each, the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Remaining Movies:**
   - Total movies: 600
   - Movies in series: 200
   - Remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)

3. **Older Movies:**
   - 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \)
   - Cost of older movies: Since older movies cost $5 each, the total cost for older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

4. **Normal Movies:**
   - Remaining movies after accounting for series and older movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)
   - Cost of normal movies: Since normal movies cost $10 each, the total cost for normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for series movies: $1200
   - Total cost for older movies: $800
   - Total cost for normal movies: $2400
   - Total cost to replace the entire collection: \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars.

The total cost to replace the movies is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours in total, but since they hiked for 1.5 hours, they drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
- They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- The distance they drove is \(4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles/hour} = 225 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked:
- They hiked at an average speed of \(50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}\).
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- The distance they hiked is \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles/hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:
- Total distance = \(225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}\).

"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earns and then find the difference.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Ava's points:
- Enemies: \( (E + 8) \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( (B + 3) \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( (T - 4) \times 30 \)

Emma's points:
- Enemies: \( E \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( B \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( T \times 30 \)

Now, let's calculate the total points for each:

Ava's total score:
\[ 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

Emma's total score:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ = -25 \]

The difference between their two scores is:

"To find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost, we can start by subtracting the total cost of the two pizzas that we know the price of from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. So, the cost of the remaining two pizzas is:

64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each:

34 dollars / 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to and from work each day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of workdays in a week to get the total weekly distance.
3. Determine the total amount of gas used per week by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency.
4. Calculate the total cost of the gas used per week by multiplying the total amount of gas used by the price per gallon.

Let's go through these steps:

1. One-way distance to work is 5 miles, so the round trip (to and from work) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
2. Andy works 5 days a week, so the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.
3. Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon, so the total amount of gas used per week is 50 miles/week / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week.
4. The price of gas is $3/gallon, so the total cost of gas per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week for his commute to work.

"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total amount of money required for the trip after the school's contribution. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate the school's contribution as follows:

School's contribution = 1/2 * Total cost of the trip
School's contribution = 1/2 * $300
School's contribution = $150

Now, we need to find out how much John needs to contribute. This is the remaining half of the trip cost:

John's required contribution = Total cost of the trip - School's contribution
John's required contribution = $300 - $150
John's required contribution = $150

John currently has $50, so the amount of money he is missing is:

Money missing = John's required contribution - Money John has
Money missing = $150 - $50
Money missing = $100

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the temperature at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

Night temperature = Day temperature - Temperature drop
Night temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees
Night temperature = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to ensure the temperature does not fall below this threshold. Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to calculate how many degrees the temperature needs to rise to reach 32 degrees:

Temperature increase needed = Desired temperature - Night temperature
Temperature increase needed = 32 degrees - 12 degrees
Temperature increase needed = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, so we can calculate the number of logs needed by dividing the temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:

Number of logs needed = Temperature increase needed / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs needed = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log
Number of logs needed = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed from the 90 people. Since each group consists of 9 people, we divide the total number of people by the group size:

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So we calculate 3/5 of the total number of groups:

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Now, we know that 6 groups had members bring back seashells. Since each member of these groups brought back 2 seashells, and each group has 9 members, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups:

6 groups * 9 members per group * 2 seashells per member = 108 seashells

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 108.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then determine the total salary cost for all employees over that period.

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of employees after three months:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary cost for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Since we need the total amount of money paid over three months, we multiply the monthly salary cost by 3:

"To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class.
- Therefore, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total collection. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:
- 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the total amount James paid:
- Total amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate is 40%. Therefore, the fifth-graders' pass rate is 80%, which means 80 out of 100 fifth-graders passed. For 400 fifth-graders, the number who passed is 400 * 0.80 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700.
- Total students = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.70 \times 100 = 70\% \]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area that can be covered.

First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag holds 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
- Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Now, we know the mosaic is 3 inches tall, so we need to find out how long it can be:
- Area of the mosaic = height * length.
- 12 square inches = 3 inches * length.
- Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed by the students and then add the remaining tea to find out how much tea was there at the beginning of the party.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   \( 4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts} \)

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the sixteen students:
   \( 16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts} \)

3. Add the tea consumed by all students:
   \( 6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts} \)

4. Add the remaining tea to the total consumed to find the initial amount of tea:
   \( 38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts} \)

5. Convert quarts to gallons (since there are 4 quarts in a gallon):
   \( 48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons} \)

Therefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of May and then subtract the initial number of students (10) to find out how many additional students have joined.

The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Starting with 10 students:

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

By the end of May, there are 320 students on campus. To find the number of additional students who have joined, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the total number of students at the end of May (320):

\(320 - 10 = 310\)

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower Rose picked, subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. For the first set of flowers:
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. For the second set of flowers:
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. For the third set of flowers:
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. For the fourth set of flowers:
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, we add up all the petals:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals in total before any flowers were dropped.

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one flower from each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals

Subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the total:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total marshmallows in the bag**: 35
2. **Marshmallows used by John**: 9
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean**: 9
4. **Marshmallows dropped on the ground**: 3

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:
\[ 9 \text{ (John)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \]

Next, subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 marshmallows left in the bag. Since John and DeSean are sharing these marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:
\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

Each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \).

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Using the relationships, we can substitute the variables:
- Since \( z = f \), we can replace \( f \) with \( z \).
- Since \( s = g \), we can replace \( g \) with \( s \).
- Since \( s = 2z \), we can replace \( s \) with \( 2z \).
- Since \( o = 2s \), and \( s = 2z \), then \( o = 2(2z) = 4z \).

Now, substitute these into the total mixture equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4(1) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has initially:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Calculate the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - Total cars no longer with Joe: \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Determine the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - He no longer has 24 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars left.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Since there are 20 students, and they each earned the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days to get the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards each person has in terms of PJ's cards. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards. According to the problem:

- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. To find out how many cards Becca has, we use the expression for Becca's cards:

\[ 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given as 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance \(D\) is the same for all animals. The speed of one kangaroo \(S_k\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3 \times S_k \times 18 \]
\[ S_k = \frac{D}{3 \times 18} = \frac{D}{54} \]

2. The speed of a turtle \(S_t\) is half the speed of a kangaroo:
\[ S_t = \frac{1}{2} \times S_k = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{D}{54} = \frac{D}{108} \]

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take 4 turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). The total speed of 4 turtles is:
\[ 4 \times S_t = 4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27} \]

4. The time \(T\) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \(D\) is:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, to find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

\[ 20 \text{ (Kora)} + 40 \text{ (Rory)} + 80 \text{ (Jada)} = 140 \]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the information given:

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200, reducing the price to $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom. This total amount, plus the $50 she still needs, should equal the reduced price of the laptop:

\[ P + 150 + 80 + 50 = 400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ P + 280 = 400 \]

Subtract 280 from both sides to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 400 - 280 \]
\[ P = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he gets from slicing 3 large and 5 small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples will yield:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will yield:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices left

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk currently produced by the 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
3 cows * 5 liters/cow/day = 15 liters/day

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The current production is 15 liters, so the additional amount needed is:
25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:
10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow/day = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig starts with. He has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Total socks: 30 (Jack) + 60 (Peter) = 90 socks
- Total dishes: 60 (Jack) + 30 (Peter) = 90 dishes

Adding these together gives the total number of items:

90 (socks) + 90 (dishes) = 180

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total, we can subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students:

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students are good at math.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will use, including setup, performance, and exit, and then subtract the intermission time from the total concert time.

Each group will use:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to 10 minutes per group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. If we subtract the 10-minute intermission, we have 110 minutes available for performances.

Now, we divide the available performance time by the time each group uses:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. To convert this to a decimal rate, we divide by the principal: \( r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - There are 40 white shirts in total.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is the total number of white shirts minus the number of white shirts with collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - There are 50 floral shirts in total.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is the total number of floral shirts minus the number of floral shirts with buttons.
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

3. **Goats remaining after the sale:**
   - Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats
   - Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats

4. **Total goats remaining in both farms:**
   - Total goats = Goats in Farm X + Goats in Farm Y

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the total number of pairs of shoes bought in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs bought:
$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

So, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

3. **Discount on Red Baskets**: You get $2 off for each basket of red food. Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Total Cost for Red Baskets After Discount**: Subtract the total discount from the total cost of the red baskets:
   \[
   54 - 6 = 48

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many rooms constitute one-half of the total rooms at the KozyInn Motel. 

Given that there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms would be:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it would take to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes to clean 45 rooms is:
\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes, and then double this amount, which is \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up the total number of homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built over the three years: \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\)

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \) (since I am three years younger than my brother)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \) (since I am two years older than my sister)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Simplify the equation step by step:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial ten people infected.

- **Day 0**: 10 people are initially infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Each of the 70 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Each of the 490 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate Rafaela's total tips:**
   - Each of the 40 customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip.
   - Total tips for Rafaela = 40 customers * $20/customer = $800.

2. **Calculate Julieta's total tips:**
   - Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela.
   - 10% of Rafaela's total tips = 10% of $800 = 0.10 * $800 = $80.
   - Julieta's total tips = Rafaela's total tips - 10% of Rafaela's total tips = $800 - $80 = $720.

3. **Calculate the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:**

"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

For soda:
- 7 bottles cost $21.00
- 1 bottle costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00

For water:
- 4 bottles cost $8.00
- 1 bottle costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00

Now, we can calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
- 3 bottles of soda cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
- 2 bottles of water cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Adding these together gives the total cost:
- Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to determine her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Ella's hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours
Ella's hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Ella's hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know Ella earns $11 per hour, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work.

Earnings for 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours
Earnings for 12 hours = $11 * 12
Earnings for 12 hours = $132

"To determine how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.**

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.**

Each chicken is sold for $50:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

**Step 3: Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.**

The profit formula is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} \]

We know the profit is $2000 and the total revenue is $9000:
\[ 2000 = 9000 - \text{Total cost} \]

Solving for the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for:
\[ 7000 \]"
"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the length of the new rope she can buy with the money.
3. Calculate the cost of the new rope.
4. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money she got from selling the old rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter.
Total money from selling the rope = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Step 2: Determine the length of the new rope she can buy.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of new rope she can buy, we divide the total money by the cost per meter.
Length of new rope = Total money / Cost per meter = $40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters (approximately)

Since Sarah can't buy a fraction of a meter, we'll assume she buys 26 meters of the new rope.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the new rope.
Cost of new rope = 26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Step 4: Calculate the leftover money.
Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of new rope = $40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation to find her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now when this will happen as \( x \). We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Cost of bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - Total cost of bacon = $10

2. **Cost of chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since the total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24

3. **Cost of strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12

4. **Cost of apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost of apples = 7 * $2 = $14

5. **Total cost of all items**:
   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
   - Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

6. **Money left in budget**:
   - Kelly’s budget is $65.
   - Money left = Budget - Total cost
   - Money left = $65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first account for the 15-minute encore that was added to the final concert. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so without the encore, the concert itself lasted:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert was twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of a usual concert by dividing the concert length (without the encore) by 2:

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

Let's calculate the total number of toys given away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Now, subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys:
200 (original toys) - 150 (toys given away) = 50 toys

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
- A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.

First, we find the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we calculate the speed of a whirligig:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's.
3. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

First, we need to determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid Tasha $6, and assuming this is the total amount he paid for the month, we can infer that this is the payment for the times she mowed his lawn. If we let \( J \) represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, then:

\[ 6J = 6 \]
\[ J = 1 \]

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once.

Next, we calculate the number of times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:
- She mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) times.
- She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) times.

Now, we need to determine how much she earned from mowing lawns. We know the total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments from Joe, Kamala, and Alba. Let's assume the payment for mowing each lawn is the same. Since Joe paid $6 for one mowing, we can assume each mowing costs $6.

- Earnings from Joe: \( 1 \times 6 = 6 \) dollars
- Earnings from Kamala: \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars
- Earnings from Alba: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) dollars

Total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \] dollars

Since Tasha made a total of $80 last month, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \] dollars

"To find out how much profit John makes on his car, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting the car and then subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate the total earnings from renting the car:

- John rents his car 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- He gets paid $25 per hour.

Total hours rented per month = 10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Total earnings per month = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, let's subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

So, John's profit from renting his car is $250.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total capacity of the pot in terms of bowls:**
   - The pot can hold enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Convert the pot's capacity to a common unit (let's use child bowls):**
   - Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (because 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls), the pot can hold 8 child bowls.

3. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for dinner:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + his wife (1 adult) + 2 children = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 people.
   - Each adult will eat 1 adult bowl, which is equivalent to 2 child bowls.
   - Each child will eat 1 child bowl.
   - Total bowls needed for dinner:
     - 2 child bowls (Calvin) + 2 child bowls (wife) + 1 child bowl (child 1) + 1 child bowl (child 2) = 6 child bowls.

4. **Determine the leftover soup:**
   - The pot contains 8 child bowls of soup.
   - 6 child bowls are used for dinner.
   - Leftover soup = 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

5. **Calculate how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:**
   - There are 2 child bowls of leftover soup.
   - There are 2 children.
   - Each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many blue and red shoe boxes Tim uses and then subtract those from the original amounts to find out how many are left.

Tim starts with:
- 7 blue shoe boxes
- 9 red shoe boxes

He uses:
- 3 blue shoe boxes
- 1/3 of his red shoe boxes

First, calculate how many red shoe boxes 1/3 of 9 is:
1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3 red shoe boxes

Now, subtract the used shoe boxes from the original amounts:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

So, the total number of shoe boxes left is:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Duncan's age eight years ago:**
   - Duncan's current age is 60.
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\).

2. **Express the relationship between Duncan's age eight years ago and Adam's age four years ago:**
   - According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   - Let \(A\) be Adam's current age.
   - Four years ago, Adam's age was \(A - 4\).
   - Therefore, \(52 = 2 \times (A - 4)\).

3. **Solve for Adam's current age:**
   - \(52 = 2 \times (A - 4)\)
   - \(52 = 2A - 8\)
   - \(52 + 8 = 2A\)
   - \(60 = 2A\)
   - \(A = 30\)

4. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years:**
   - Adam's current age is 30.
   - In 8 years, Adam's age will be \(30 + 8 = 38\).

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find the total number of acres that Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms have together, we first need to determine the size of each farm and then add them together.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm as follows:
- Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres.
- Adding 100 acres to this gives \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres.

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together:
- Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
- Farmer Smith's farm: 500 acres

Total acres: \(200 + 500 = 700\)

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which means he drinks 1 bottle every 30 minutes.
2. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes to complete.
3. An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal Sudoku puzzle, so it takes 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, we divide the total time by the interval:

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while completing an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of red balloons and the bologna thrown at them:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - There are 20 red balloons.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:
     \[
     20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - Out of these, 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
     \[
     58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces at red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
     \[
     3y = 18
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total miles Jon drives in a month:
   - Jon drives 100 miles a day.
   - In a 30-day month, he drives \( 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \).

2. Determine how many tune-ups are needed based on the total miles driven:
   - The car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.
   - For 3000 miles, the number of tune-ups required is \( \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \).

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, at $7 each, is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14
- Total cost = $28

Since this total amount was the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, we divide it by 2 to find out how much each received:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2
- Allowance per person = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the total profit the class was able to raise from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total cups**: Lana has 27 cups.
2. **Rows**: She divides these into 3 rows.
3. **Cinnamon tea**: She uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea.

First, we need to find out how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea after accounting for the cinnamon tea:

\[ 27 \text{ cups} - 15 \text{ cups of cinnamon tea} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Since the number of chamomile and mint tea cups are equal, we divide the 12 cups by 2:

\[ 12 \text{ cups} \div 2 = 6 \text{ cups of chamomile tea} \]
\[ 12 \text{ cups} \div 2 = 6 \text{ cups of mint tea} \]

These 6 cups of mint tea are then divided equally among the 3 rows:

\[ 6 \text{ cups of mint tea} \div 3 \text{ rows} = 2 \text{ cups of mint tea per row} \]

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial amount of water in the tank:**
   - The pool has 10,000 gallons of water.
   - The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool.
   - Therefore, the tank is filled with \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) gallons of water.

2. **Calculate the amount of water used over 6 days:**
   - The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.
   - Over 6 days, the total amount of water used is \( 500 \times 6 = 3,000 \) gallons.

3. **Determine the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days:**
   - Initial amount of water in the tank: 5,000 gallons.
   - Amount of water used in 6 days: 3,000 gallons.
   - Remaining water in the tank: \( 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \) gallons.

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is 2,000 gallons.

- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Now, let's add up all his expenses so far:
- Total movie cost: $50 + $56 = $106
- Total snack cost: $16 + $8 = $24
- Total expenses: $106 + $24 = $130

Colby's parents give him $150 per month, so let's see how much he has left:
- Remaining money: $150 - $130 = $20

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for this will be:
- Movie ticket: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Candy: $2
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( L \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and solve for \( J \):
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the hay needed for the goats:
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. Calculate the hay needed for the sheep:
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total hay needed:
   - Total hay = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

Earnings = Hourly Rate * Hours Worked
Earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours
Earnings = 300 dollars

Next, we'll subtract the amount he spends on gas and the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:

Remaining Money = Earnings - Cost of Gas - Bank Deposit
Remaining Money = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 100 dollars
Remaining Money = 150 dollars

Now, we'll calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:

Cost of Pencils = Number of Pencils * Cost per Pencil
Cost of Pencils = 5 * 10 dollars
Cost of Pencils = 50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

Money After Pencils = Remaining Money - Cost of Pencils
Money After Pencils = 150 dollars - 50 dollars
Money After Pencils = 100 dollars

Finally, we'll determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the money he has left:

Number of Pens = Money After Pencils / Cost per Pen
Number of Pens = 100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen
Number of Pens = 4

John can buy 4 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the different segments of James's journey across the lake.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - The time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - The rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).
   - The time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can set up the equation based on the information given. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. If Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate the number of loaves the bakery has as follows:

Let \( S \) represent the number of loaves Sam had, which is 70.

The bakery has \( 7S - 40 \) loaves.

Substituting \( S = 70 \):

\( 7 \times 70 - 40 = 490 - 40 = 450 \)

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum them up.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - Total commission from 6 copies = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - Total commission from 10 copies = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two more equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the occupancy after 2 weeks (14 days).
   - Total patients admitted in 14 days = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

4. **Total Occupied Beds After 14 Days**: 
   - Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 14 days
   - Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

5. **Unoccupied Beds**:
   - Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
   - Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of Pokémon each person has caught with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation. First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[
A + S + W = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339

"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we first need to determine each of their ages based on the information provided.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years old.
2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) years old.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find her age, we calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:
   - 25% of 8 is \( 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \) years.
   - Therefore, Nani's sister's age is \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members:
- Nani: 8 years

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total boxes of oranges bought**: Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes.
2. **Boxes given away**: She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes.
3. **Boxes remaining after giving away**: 
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
   \]
4. **Oranges in the remaining boxes**: Each box contains 20 oranges, so:
   \[
   8 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 160 \text{ oranges}
   \]
5. **Oranges kept by Mrs. Harrington**: She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \text{ oranges}
   \]
6. **Oranges sold**: The rest of the oranges were sold, which is:
   \[
   160 - 40 = 120 \text{ oranges}
   \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members, and then add these numbers together.

First, we calculate the number of football players:
20% of 30 students are football players.
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we determine the number of students who are not football players:
30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:
6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet**: Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower**: Each flower requires 1 foot of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each flower. Therefore, the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (flower)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many flowers can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/flower}} = 44.4 \text{ flowers}
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   44 \text{ flowers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy**: Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:
   \[
   44 \text{ flowers} - 17 \text{ flowers} = 27 \text{ flowers}

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for the adults and the kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices. There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total watermelon is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), and the total watermelon is \( 8x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in one box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, and Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes. Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars. This can be expressed as:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the number of sessions. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Cost per session:**
   - Studio rental: $25
   - Cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Total cost per student per session: 10 students * $1.50 = $15
   - Total cost per session: $25 (rental) + $15 (students) = $40

2. **Number of sessions per week:**
   - The studio is rented 3 days a week.

3. **Number of sessions per month:**
   - Assuming 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions per month is 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

4. **Total monthly cost:**
   - Total cost per session * number of sessions per month = $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, and we have only calculated the costs, we need to clarify if there is any revenue or if the question is asking for the total expenses. Assuming the question is asking for the total expenses (as there is no mention of revenue):

The expected earnings (or rather, the total expenses) of the dance studio in a month are $480.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. We know that Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. We can set up the equation:

\[ 4 \times \text{number of chocolate bars per box} = 64 \]

Solving for the number of chocolate bars per box:

\[ \text{number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. We know that Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the equation:

\[ 7 \times \text{number of chocolate bars per box} = 56 \]

Solving for the number of chocolate bars per box:

\[ \text{number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:

\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   - Number of female porcupines = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \).

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Total number of babies born each month = 30 (female porcupines) × 4 (babies per female) = 120 babies.

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total number of babies born in a year = 120 (babies per month) × 12 (months) = 1440 babies.

4. **Calculate the total population after a year:**
   - Initial population = 50 porcupines.
   - Total population after a year = Initial population + Total number of babies born in a year.
   - Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490.

Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( x - 0.07x = 0.93x \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.93x - 0.07(0.93x) = 0.93^2x \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.93^2x - 0.07(0.93^2x) = 0.93^3x \).

   Given that the final charge is 28%, we have:
   \[
   0.93^3x = 0.28
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.93^3}
   \]
   \[
   x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( y - 0.09y = 0.91y \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.91y - 0.09(0.91y) = 0.91^2y \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^2y - 0.09(0.91^2y) = 0.91^3y \).
   - After 4 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^3y - 0.09(0.91^3y) = 0.91^4y \).
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^4y - 0.09(0.91^4y) = 0.91^5y \).

   Given that the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was 34.8%, we have:
   \[
   0.91^5y = 0.348
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.91^5}
   \]
   \[
   y \approx \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.558
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the first 5 hours was approximately 55.8%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.8%.

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich should be the same for all packages. Therefore, the cost for the package with 8 sandwiches can be calculated as:
\[ 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

"Tom initially pays $1000 towards the new bedroom set, reducing the total cost from $3000 to $2000. The remaining $2000 is what he needs to pay off with a 10% monthly interest rate.

However, the way the question is phrased, it seems to imply that Tom is paying 10% of the remaining balance each month, not that the 10% is an interest rate added to the balance. If this is the case, then Tom would pay 10% of $2000 each month, which is:

$2000 * 10% = $2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. This is a 50% chance.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher is present, there is a 40% chance she will give an extension to the whole class.
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension to the whole class (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension.

Let's break down the probabilities for the normal teacher scenario:
- **Whole Class Extension (40% chance):**
  - If the whole class gets an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
- **No Whole Class Extension (60% chance):**
  - If the whole class does not get an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can get a personal extension.
  - If Marcus does not get a personal extension (80% chance), he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the combined probabilities:
- **Probability of not having to turn in homework with the normal teacher:**
  - Whole class extension: \(0.40\)
  - Personal extension: \(0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.12\)
  - Total for normal teacher: \(0.40 + 0.12 = 0.52\)

- **Total probability of not having to turn in homework:**
  - Substitute teacher: \(0.50\)
  - Normal teacher: \(0.50 \times 0.52 = 0.26\)
  - Combined: \(0.50 + 0.26 = 0.76\)

- **Probability of having to turn in homework:**
  - \(1 - 0.76 = 0.24\)

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

"To determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we first need to calculate the total number of seats available for guests after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

The total number of seats in the Fine Arts Center is 6000. We subtract the seats reserved for graduates and faculty:

6000 (total seats) - 950 (seats for graduates) - 300 (seats for faculty) = 4750 (seats for guests)

Next, we need to divide the number of guest seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive:

4750 (seats for guests) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow the relationships given:

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of medium beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is:
   \[
   \text{Number of small beans} = 3 \times \text{Number of medium beans} = 3 \times 150 = 450
   \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of soda bottles Richard will place and the total time it will take him to drop the candy into each bottle.

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle: \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \).

2. **Calculate the total time to drop the candy:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he doesn't need to move to reach the first bottle.
   - He needs to move from one bottle to the next, and it takes him 5 seconds to move between each bottle.
   - Since there are 8 bottles, he will move between bottles 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).
   - The total time to move between bottles is \( 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she buys and subtract that from the $50 she starts with.

First, calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
2 pounds of Parmesan at $11 per pound = 2 * $11 = $22

Next, calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
3 pounds of Mozzarella at $6 per pound = 3 * $6 = $18

Now, add the costs of both types of cheese to find the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of Mozzarella = $22 + $18 = $40

Finally, subtract the total cost of the cheese from the $50 Amor starts with:
Money left = $50 - $40 = $10

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in school. Then, we'll determine how long it will take for him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost while in school:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Determine Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

So, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   - They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's deliveries: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   - They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's deliveries: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

Next, we calculate the average loss per race:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = \(21.5 / 3 = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss is $7.17.

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since heights are given in both feet and inches, we will convert everything to inches for simplicity.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times (x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days worked by the team.
2. Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter.

Let's go through each step:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days worked is:
   \[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

2. Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.

3. There are 24 hours in a day, so \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day in hours is:
   \[ \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/day} \]

4. The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is:
   \[ 21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

5. Since there are 4 painters, the hours worked by each painter is:
   \[ \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, let's combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, which means each year the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3.

\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.78.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( D \) represent the number of minutes Donovan's part took. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as \( D + 18 \).

The total time for the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each took, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify and solve for \( D \):

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the daily number of emails requiring a response by the number of workdays in a week.

First, we determine the number of emails that require a response each day. Since 20% of the emails do not require a response, 80% do require a response. 

80% of 80 emails is calculated as:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ emails per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320 \text{ emails} \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost of mailing all the coupons is the sum of the costs for the small and big coupons:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion at the grocery store. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""

First, let's calculate the cost for 2 pounds of butter under the promotion:
- The first pound costs $4.00.
- The second pound is half off, so it costs $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of butter is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost for 2 pounds by 3 (since 6 pounds is 3 times 2 pounds):
\[ 6.00 \times 3 = 18.00 \]

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys.
3. Subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315 bananas.

Next, we calculate the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, we find the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day.
- The second monkey eats 14 bananas per day.
- Together, they eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315, we can find the total daily consumption of all three monkeys:
- Total daily consumption = \(315 \div 7 = 45\) bananas per day.

Finally, we subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey:
- Daily consumption of the third monkey = \(45 - 24 = 21\) bananas per day.

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors had scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken can from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them being shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total (2 shaken and 8 unshaken).

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ P(\text{shaken}) = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:

\[ P(\text{shaken}) \times 100\% = \frac{1}{5} \times 100\% = 20\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together to find the total distance between the two trains.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

In 3 hours, the second train will have traveled:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps based on his working days.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of working days = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of working days * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day and then multiply by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total break and lunch time per day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks * 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time per day:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1 hour

Now, calculate the total time over 5 days:
1 hour per day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance that Amber ran, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. **Return**: She returned an item that cost $15.00, so this amount is subtracted from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. **Frying Pan Purchase**: The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. **Towels Purchase**: The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. **Total New Purchases**: Add the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts Marty cuts from the 100 centimeters of ribbon. We do this by dividing the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts:

100 centimeters / 4 parts = 25 centimeters per part

Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. We find the length of each of these smaller parts by dividing the length of the larger part by 5:

25 centimeters / 5 parts = 5 centimeters per part

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and then figure out how many miles she plans to hike each day.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and the distance she will cover at her current plan is:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's break down the information and calculate step by step.

1. **Total toys needed**: 400 toys.
2. **Toys still needed after the shift**: 20 toys.
3. **Toys produced during the shift**: 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total production by the first four workers:

- **Two workers producing 6 toys per hour**: 
  - Each worker produces 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 60 toys.
  - Two workers produce 60 toys * 2 = 120 toys.

- **Two workers producing 4 toys per hour**:
  - Each worker produces 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 40 toys.
  - Two workers produce 40 toys * 2 = 80 toys.

Total production by the first four workers:
- 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

Now, we know the total production by the fifth worker:
- Total production by all workers: 380 toys.
- Production by the first four workers: 200 toys.
- Production by the fifth worker: 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys.

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the production rate of the fifth worker is:
- 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we first need to calculate what half the Earth's circumference is. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be:

40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Now, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow the information step by step:

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so:
   \( 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \)
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so:
   \( 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \)

The fastest car can go 750 miles per hour. 

750 mph"
"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: They painted the same number of eggs. Let's call the number of eggs each of them painted \( A \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: They painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Camden painted \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted \( S \).

From the information given:
- \( C + S = 30 \)
- \( C = S + 12 \)

We can substitute \( C \) in the first equation with \( S + 12 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. Since the total number of eggs is 56 and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs:
\[ A + A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds.

1. First, we determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons:
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. Since each group goes into one box, there will be 25 boxes.

3. Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. Then, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, knowing that there are 16 ounces in a pound:
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To determine how much John makes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the usable length of the tree.
2. Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
3. Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.

**Step 1: Calculate the usable length of the tree.**

The tree is 80 feet tall, and 80% of it can be used for logs:
\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.**

Each log is 4 feet long, so the number of logs is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.**

Each log yields 5 planks, so the total number of planks is:
\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.**

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John makes:
\[ 96 \]"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:
   \[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

2. Calculate their combined salary:
   \[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

3. Determine how much their mother earns. Since their mother earns twice their combined salary:
   \[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

4. Add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:
   \[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

For the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. We know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved and then figure out how much more she needs to save.

1. Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far:
   - Jane saves $4 every week.
   - She has been saving for 8 weeks.
   - Total saved so far = $4 * 8 = $32.

2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
   - Total goal = $60.
   - Amount already saved = $32.
   - Amount needed = $60 - $32 = $28.

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the additional $28:
   - She saves $4 each week.
   - Number of weeks needed = $28 / $4 = 7 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out how many marbles Bob has initially.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob has initially:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of the marbles he has. We can calculate this by subtracting 10 from the initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the 33-degree water, results in a mixture that is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water, the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average formula:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these increases to the initial numbers:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

Total number of cows after three weeks:
50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

Total number of chickens after three weeks:
20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700 animals

"To find out how much each single bagel costs after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10.00 = 40.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. A 10% discount on $40.00 is:
   \[
   0.10 \times 40.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, the discounted total cost is:
   \[
   40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per bagel is the discounted total cost divided by the total number of bagels:
   \[
   \frac{36.00}{36} = 1.00 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel after the discount is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
- Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
- 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make the scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem:
- It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
- 3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.
- 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops.

To find the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
- 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops.

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester needs:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

"To find out how many blue jellybeans there are, we can start by calculating the number of red jellybeans, which is twice the number of green jellybeans. There are 17 green jellybeans, so:

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. This means that the total parts of the ratio (5 parts men + 9 parts women) is 14 parts.

To find out how many people each part represents, we divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of people per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = 5 parts × 6 people per part = 30 men
- Number of women = 9 parts × 6 people per part = 54 women

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to consider both the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers that are part of the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets per day is:
- \( 7 \text{ bouquets/day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers/bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day} \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = individual sunflowers + sunflowers in bouquets
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84 = 97.

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
- Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day \(\times\) 3 days = 291.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

0.20 (probability of the first ticket winning) * 0.60 (probability of the second ticket winning) = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bottles of carrot juice are required to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then find out how many more bottles Hortex would need to produce beyond its current production capacity.

1. First, we need to find out how many bottles are required to meet 100% of one person's daily energy needs. Since one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, we can calculate the number of bottles needed for 100% as follows:
   \[
   \text{Bottles per person} = \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total number of bottles needed to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people:
   \[
   \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total required:
   \[
   \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
   \]

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles of carrot juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color:**
   - Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
   - 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
   - 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

2. **Determine the number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - All 2 blue-wearers also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers also wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearers.

3. **Calculate the total number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - Total octuplets wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 octuplets.

4. **Determine the number of octuplets wearing both a bow and purple:**
   - 2 purple-wearers also wear bows.

5. **Calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - Probability = (Number of purple-wearers with bows) / (Total number of bow-wearers)
   - Probability = \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)

6. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - Percentage = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \)

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to break down the sales step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it, which is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - He earns $50 from this sale.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land, which is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - He earns $30 from this sale.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.
   - The earnings from this sale are \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Adding up all the earnings:
     - First sale: $50
     - Second sale: $30
     - Final sale: $90
   - Total earnings: \( 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \) dollars.

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Determine the total number of apartments John collects from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Compute the total earnings based on the number of collections and the rate per collection.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ additional apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of apartments John collects from.**

Adding the apartments from all three complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections per week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ times per week} = 3120 \text{ collections per week} \]

**Step 4: Compute the total earnings.**

John gets paid $0.40 per collection:
\[ 3120 \text{ collections} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars per collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John makes:

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.
5. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

Now, we need to sum the fruits produced from year 5 to year 10, and assume that the tree does not produce any fruits in the first four years:

- Year 1: 0 fruits
- Year 2: 0 fruits
- Year 3: 0 fruits
- Year 4: 0 fruits
- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Adding these together:

\[0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350\]

The total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is 2350.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **After Giving Money to Their Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     15 - x = 12 \implies x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

3. **Amount Left with Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave \(x = 3\) dollars to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

So, the amount left in Ronnie's money is \(2\).

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. This means that the melting rate is \( \frac{2}{15} \) snowballs per minute.

The net rate of snowball accumulation is the difference between the making rate and the melting rate:
\[ \text{Net rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute} \]

To find out how long it will take to accumulate 60 snowballs at this net rate, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total snowballs needed}}{\text{Net rate}} = \frac{60}{\frac{1}{5}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days and then determine the initial number of bandages.

**Total bandages used:**
- First day: 38 bandages
- Second day: 28 bandages
- Third day: 25 bandages
- Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages

**Total bandages ordered:**
- First day: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
- Third day: 2 bulk packs (100 bandages)
- Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages

**Net change in bandages:**
- Total bandages ordered: 150
- Total bandages used: 91
- Net change: \(150 - 91 = 59\) bandages added

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can determine the initial number of bandages by subtracting the net change from the final number of bandages:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 59 = 19 \]

Therefore, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut based on the length of hair cut off and add the cost of the hair color.

1. Calculate the length of hair cut off:
   - Initial length: 10 inches
   - Final length: 8 inches
   - Length cut off: 10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches

2. Calculate the cost of the haircut:
   - Cost per inch: $30
   - Total cost for haircut: 2 inches * $30/inch = $60

3. Add the cost of the hair color:
   - Cost of color: $40
   - Total cost: $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100

The total cost of May's cut and color is $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5 \, \text{per hour} = 67.5 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5 \, \text{per hour} = \$101.25 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
\[ \$101.25 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$405 \]

Next, we add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
- Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total attendance bonus is:
\[ \$10 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$40 \]

Finally, we add her earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
\[ \$405 + \$40 = \$445 \]

Thus, Jen will receive:
\[ \$445 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he completed the task and then sum these amounts.

- Laundry: $3.00 * 1 = $3.00
- Cleaning his room: $1.50 * 1 = $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, we add up all the amounts:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Number of Bottles of Cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
     \]

3. **Cost per Bottle of Cognac:**
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
     \[
     60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost of Cognac:**
   - The total cost for 20 bottles of cognac is:
     \[
     20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost of Everything:**
   - The total cost of everything John buys is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:
     \[
     600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. Therefore, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \( \frac{1}{4} \) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. The number of additional Lodgepole Pine trees is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) trees.
   - Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( x \) represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40."" This can be translated into the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

"To determine how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, let's break down the information and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors.
     \[ 2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors/palette} = 8 \text{ colors} \]
   - Amy also had three makeup sets, each with 6 colors.
     \[ 3 \text{ makeup sets} \times 6 \text{ colors/set} = 18 \text{ colors} \]

   So, initially, Amy had:
   \[ 8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from makeup sets} = 26 \text{ colors} \]

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
- Base area = 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches
- Height = 15 inches

Volume of the jar = Base area * Height = 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

Packing efficiency = 80% = 0.80

Effective volume occupied by jelly beans = Volume of the jar * Packing efficiency
= 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Volume of one jelly bean = 0.15 cubic inches

Total number of jelly beans = Effective volume occupied by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
= 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.

Estimated number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 30%
= 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

True number of red jelly beans = 900

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Estimated number of red jelly beans
= 900 - 864 = 36

Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - The new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**
   - Total cost = Cost before the price increase + Cost after the price increase
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all her visits to the museum.

"To determine how long it will take for all the students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of students and then figure out how many groups of 8 are needed, and finally, how much time all these groups will require.

1. **Total number of students:**
   - There are 10 students from each grade.
   - There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th).
   - Total students = 10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students.

2. **Number of groups needed:**
   - Each group can have 8 students.
   - Number of groups = Total students / Students per group = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

3. **Total time required:**
   - Each group gets 45 minutes.
   - Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for all the students to try the escape room.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation to represent the total length:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds required for 80 meatballs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call with the given pricing structure, we need to break the call into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after the price drops.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
   \( 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \)

2. For the remaining 20 minutes (36 minutes total - 16 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
   \( 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \)

3. Adding the costs of both segments together gives the total cost of the call:
   \( \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \)

The total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes:**
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
     \[
     b = 3c - 2
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of treats:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
     \[
     5 \times 2 = 10
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]

5. **Substitute the expression for \( b \) from step 2 into the equation from step 4:**
   \[
   c + (3c - 2) = 10
   \]

6. **Simplify and solve for \( c \):**
   \[
   c + 3c - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4c - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4c = 12

"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a manicure and a pedicure with the 20% discount.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art.
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount:

- The cost of a manicure is $35.
- The cost of a pedicure is $40.
- The total cost without discount is $35 + $40 = $75.
- The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.
- The discounted cost is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the nail art:

- Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails.
- The cost per nail is $3.
- The total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:

- Total cost = $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues she receives from all her magazines.

1. The first 3 magazines send 12 issues each per year. So, the total from these is:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues.

2. The next magazine sends 6 issues a year, so the total from this one is:
   \(6\) issues.

3. The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues.

Adding all these together gives the total number of issues Susan receives each year:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\).

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can set up the relationships described in the problem with equations. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem:
- Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.
- Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, Samantha has \( (K + 8) - 12 \) paintings.

Since Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:
\[ (K + 8) - 12 = 27 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( K \):
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the price in December:**
   - The original price in November was $40.
   - The price increased by 80% in December.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40: \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - The new price in December is the original price plus the increase: \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

2. **Determine the price in January:**
   - The price in December was $72.
   - The price decreased by 50% in January.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72: \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - The new price in January is the December price minus the decrease: \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the different rates for his lessons.

1. For the standard rate lessons:
- He charges $80 per hour.
- He has 4 of these lessons.
- The total for these lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

2. For the veteran lessons:
- He reduces his rate by 25%, so the reduced rate is 75% of $80.
- The reduced rate is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour.
- He has 2 of these lessons.
- The total for these lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the totals from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of the 60 apples:

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after he ate some is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, the number of apples left after giving some to his sister is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples after giving to sister} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given. If 9 novels represent 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can denote the total number of novels she has written this year as \( x \).

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ \frac{3}{4}x = 9 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ x = 3 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, we have the distance Michael has traveled (3600 km) and the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km). To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, the mother used \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.

Now, let's add up all the grapes used:

- Grapes eaten by Madeline: 6
- Grapes used by her brother: 30
- Grapes used by their mother: 48

Total grapes used: \(6 + 30 + 48 = 84\)

"To calculate the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to first determine the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

1. Cost of pasta per week: $1.00
2. Cost of cheddar cheese per week: $3.00
3. Cost of gruyere cheese per week: 2 * $3.00 = $6.00

Now, let's add these costs to find the total weekly cost:

Total weekly cost = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese
Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00
Total weekly cost = $10.00

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the annual cost is:

Annual cost = Total weekly cost * Number of weeks in a year
Annual cost = $10.00 * 52
Annual cost = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

2. Determine the total available working time in minutes over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Convert the average time spent cleaning per day into a percentage of the total working day.

**Step 1: Total time required to clean all classrooms**
- There are 80 classrooms.
- It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom.
- Total time required = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

**Step 2: Total available working time in minutes over 5 days**
- The custodian works 8 hours per day.
- 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.
- Over 5 days, the total available working time = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes.

**Step 3: Average time spent cleaning per day**
- Total time required to clean all classrooms = 1200 minutes.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books each bookcase can hold.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books each, so together they can hold:
   \( 10 \text{ books/shelf} \times 2 \text{ shelves} = 20 \text{ books} \)

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
   \( 10 \text{ books/shelf} \times 2 = 20 \text{ books} \)

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
   \( 20 \text{ books} - 5 \text{ books} = 15 \text{ books} \)

4. Adding up the books that all the shelves can hold gives us the total capacity of one bookcase:
   \( 20 \text{ books (middle shelves)} + 20 \text{ books (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ books (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books/bookcase} \)

5. To find out how many bookcases Elly needs for her 110 books, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
   \( 110 \text{ books} \div 55 \text{ books/bookcase} = 2 \text{ bookcases} \)

Since 110 is exactly divisible by 55, Elly will need exactly 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to determine the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide that cost by the number of sticks in the bag.

The original cost of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the cost of the bag after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky, so the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to get right on the second test = 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There is a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people.
   - There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 2 * 8 (for rooms)
   - Total flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 4 small candles for half the rooms.
   - There are 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms.
   - Half of the 8 rooms is 4 rooms.
   - Total small candles = 4 small candles/room * 4 rooms = 16 small candles
   - Total medium candles = 5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms = 20 medium candles
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**

"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Helmets**: We are given that there are 20 helmets.
2. **Number of Robots**: The problem states that there are half as many robots as helmets. Therefore, the number of robots is:
   \[
   \text{Number of Robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]
3. **Number of Footballs**: The problem also states that there are half as many helmets as footballs. Therefore, the number of footballs is:
   \[
   \text{Number of Footballs} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of items Dominick saw, which includes the helmets, robots, and footballs:
\[
\text{Total Number of Items} = \text{Number of Helmets} + \text{Number of Robots} + \text{Number of Footballs}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel 200 yards, with half the distance on land and the other half in water.

First, we calculate the distance for each part of the journey:
- Half of 200 yards is 100 yards on land.
- The other half is 100 yards in water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to travel each part:
- On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. The time to travel 100 yards on land is:
  \[
  \text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- In water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. The time to travel 100 yards in water is:
  \[
  \text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his speed training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate the new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM.**

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: 20 more people than the first day, so:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
   \]
3. **Third Day**: Twice the number of people on the second day, so:
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]
4. **Rest of the Week (4 days)**: Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw over these 4 days is:
   \[
   60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ people}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of people Conor saw over the entire week:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the popping rates and the number of kernels that pop in each 30-second interval:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the following 30 seconds, the popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.
5. After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. This is \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:

- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Second 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Third 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Fourth 30 seconds: 40 kernels
- After the pan is taken off the heat: 10 kernels

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we first need to determine the age of each sibling and then sum these ages.

- The three sisters are each 16 years old.
- One brother is 12 years old.
- The older brother is twice the age of the 12-year-old brother, so he is 24 years old.

Now, we sum the ages:
- Total age of the sisters: \(3 \times 16 = 48\)
- Age of the 12-year-old brother: \(12\)
- Age of the 24-year-old brother: \(24\)

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- Over 4 weeks, the total meditation time is 210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- In one week, she spends 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes on yoga.
- Over 4 weeks, the total yoga time is 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

Now, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 2040 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 34 hours.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 34 hours on meditation and yoga practice.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower:**
   - A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
   - 1 dozen = 12 seeds.
   - Therefore, 3 dozen seeds = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

2. **Calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower:**
   - A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   - 50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds.
   - Therefore, the number of seeds in a large sunflower = 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

3. **Calculate the total number of seeds:**
   - Total seeds = seeds in a small sunflower + seeds in a large sunflower.
   - Total seeds = 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
