"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. That means she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself. 

So, the number of eggs left to sell is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is 9 * 2 = $18.

"To find out how many bolts in total it takes to make a robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It takes half that much white fiber, which means:
\[ \text{White fiber} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Now, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ \text{Total bolts} = 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts needed is:

"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. 

To find 250% of $80,000:
\[ 250\% \times 80,000 = 2.5 \times 80,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Purchase price} + \text{Repair cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each time by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by how many times he does this in a week.

He runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So for each session, he runs:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

He does this 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed the chickens should get in a day and then subtract what they have already been given.

1. Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
2. Wendi has 20 chickens.
3. So, the total daily feed for all chickens is \(3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}\).

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups.
- Total feed given by the afternoon is \(15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}\).

Finally, we find out how much more feed is needed for the final meal:
- Total daily feed needed is 60 cups.
- Feed already given is 40 cups.
- Feed needed for the final meal is \(60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}\).

"To figure out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to break it down:

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.
3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

So, for every two glasses, Kylar pays $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying:
16 / 2 = 8 pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

64"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, Charleston has:
   \[
   4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has:
   \[
   2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]

Now, we add up the sheep from all three cities:
\[
20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

So, the total number of sheep is 260.

"First, let's figure out how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart. She downloads 2 GB per minute, and 40% of the way through a 200 GB file is:

200 GB * 40% = 80 GB

To find out how long it takes to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the 20-minute restart, Carla has to start the download all over again. So, the total time to download the 200 GB file is the time for the initial 80 GB, the 20-minute restart, and the full 200 GB download:

40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + (200 GB / 2 GB/minute) = 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes

"First, let's figure out how far John drives initially.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's see how far he gets back home in the 4 hours.

- For the first 2 hours, he is in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move at all.
- For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
  \[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]
- For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:
  \[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Total distance he covers on his way back:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's find out how far he is from home:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and then her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime.

1. Calculate the earnings for the first 40 hours:
   - Regular rate: $10 per hour
   - Hours worked: 40
   - Earnings for 40 hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Calculate the earnings for the 5 hours of overtime:
   - Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate
   - Overtime rate: 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour
   - Hours of overtime: 5
   - Earnings for 5 hours of overtime: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. Add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours:
   - Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

"First, let's figure out the number of downloads each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month. So, we calculate:
3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the reduction, we calculate 30% of 180:
0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads.

So, the number of downloads in the third month is:
180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

1. **Donuts:**
   - She bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add the costs together:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

So, the total cost is $694.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total earnings over the years.

First, let's calculate the yearly profit from the lemons:
- Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- So, the yearly income from lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5.

Next, let's calculate the yearly cost:
- It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.
- So, the yearly cost is $3.

Now, let's find the yearly profit:
- Yearly profit = Yearly income - Yearly cost
- Yearly profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

The initial cost to plant the tree is $90. To find out how many years it will take to cover this cost, we divide the initial cost by the yearly profit:
- Number of years = Initial cost / Yearly profit
- Number of years = $90 / $7.5 = 12.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After selling at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
6. After selling at the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
7. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's figure out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left.

Next, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

So, the number of students left for hip-hop dance is:

16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To figure out which option will give the merchant more profit, we need to calculate the profit from each option.

First, let's calculate the profit from the jewelry:
- The jewelry is worth $5,000.
- The market is expected to go up by 2.5%.

To find the profit from the jewelry, we multiply the value of the jewelry by the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Profit from jewelry} = 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \]

Next, let's calculate the profit from the electronic gadgets:
- The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000.
- The market is expected to rise by 1.2%.

To find the profit from the electronic gadgets, we multiply the value of the gadgets by the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Profit from gadgets} = 8000 \times \frac{1.2}{100} = 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \]

Now, we compare the two profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit. The profit from the jewelry is $125.

"To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled each day.

First, we look at the distance traveled on the first day:
- Each train travels 80 miles westward.

Next, we look at the distance traveled on the second day:
- Each train travels 150 miles northward.

Now, we add these two distances together to get the total distance covered by each train:
- Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
230 miles

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both jobs and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- So, her weekly earnings from teaching are 35 hours * $20/hour = $700.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from being a cheerleading coach:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- So, her weekly earnings from coaching are 15 hours * $30/hour = $450.

Now, let's add her weekly earnings from both jobs:
- Her total weekly earnings are $700 (teaching) + $450 (coaching) = $1150.

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary is:
- 50 weeks * $1150/week = $57,500.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses each day.
2. Multiply the daily amount by the number of days in a week to get the weekly total.
3. Multiply the weekly total by 4 to get the total for 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens (1 dozen = 12 eggs).

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs each day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week

Step 3: For 4 weeks:
21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Step 4: Convert 84 eggs to dozens:
84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To find out the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to figure out how much time she has left to complete the trail and how much distance she has left to cover.

1. **Total Distance**: The trail is 12 miles long.
2. **Distance Covered So Far**: Marissa has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.
3. **Remaining Distance**: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

Next, we need to calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

4. **Total Time for Average Speed**: To find the total time, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Time Already Spent**: Marissa has already spent 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours walking.

6. **Time Left**: 
   \[
   \text{Time Left} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour.

7. **Required Speed**:
   \[
   \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Time Left}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"First, let's figure out how much water is in the orange drink and the pineapple drink before any spilling happens.

For the orange drink:
- It's 10 liters total.
- Two-thirds of it is water.
- So, the amount of water in the orange drink is \(10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- It's 15 liters total.
- Three-fifths of it is water.
- So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \(15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9\) liters.

Now, you spill 1 liter of the orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter is:
- \(1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67\) liters.

So, the remaining water in the orange drink after spilling is:
- \(6.67 - 0.67 = 6\) liters.

Now, we add the remaining 9 liters of orange drink (which has 6 liters of water) to the 15 liters of pineapple drink (which has 9 liters of water):
- Total water = 6 liters (from orange) + 9 liters (from pineapple) = 15 liters.

So, the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we know Samantha is 31 years old now and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. So, Raymond's current age is:
31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago this was, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
37 - 23 = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we first need to figure out how long the candle burns. The candle starts burning at 1:00 PM and stops at 5:00 PM. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the amount it melts each hour:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid, $19.50, is 75% of the original price because he got a 25% discount. 

Let's call the original price \( P \).

Since $19.50 is 75% of \( P \), we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes Marie ordered is:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then add them all together.

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs × $16.50 per pair = $49.50.

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - One pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs × $22.50 per pair = $67.50.

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - One pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs × $42 per pair = $126.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will eat:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to look at the distances he covered before and after each stop.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means he stopped at the 45-mile mark (60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles).

To find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:
45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To find out how much the boots cost, we first need to figure out the total cost of the two pairs of high heels.

The first pair of heels costs $33. The second pair costs twice as much as the first pair, so:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, we add the cost of both pairs of heels together:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

The two pairs of heels together cost $99, and this is $5 less than the cost of the boots. So, to find the cost of the boots, we add $5 to the total cost of the heels:
\[ 99 + 5 = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost:

"To find out Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to figure out their current ages based on the ratio and the total age given.

1. The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts.
2. The total parts of their ages combined is 7 + 11 = 18 parts.
3. We know their total age is 162 years. So, each part of their ages is 162 / 18 = 9 years.
4. Darrell's age is 7 parts, so 7 * 9 = 63 years.
5. Allen's age is 11 parts, so 11 * 9 = 99 years.
6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109 years.

"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours John spends on the dogs each day.
2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

First, we know each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of. John has 10 dogs, so:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

"Let's use some simple math to figure this out. If we say the number of silver coins is S, then the number of gold coins would be S + 30, because there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

The total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation:
S + (S + 30) = 110

Now, let's solve for S:
2S + 30 = 110
2S = 110 - 30
2S = 80
S = 80 / 2
S = 40

So, there are 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
40 + 30 = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels

Now, Aaron has 5 more than this amount:

Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so:

Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \) point.
- So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we add the points from both periods:
- Total points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes
- Total points = 4 + 5 = 9

So, the total points Mike scored is 9.

"First, let's figure out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we can calculate the total cost for 15 sets:

15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to figure out the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running, and then divide the distance by the time to get his speed.

1. **Total Distance**: John runs 60 miles a week.

2. **Total Time**:
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs for 1.5 hours each day.
   - Total time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

3. **Speed**:
   - Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
   - Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, running speed = 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running speed is four times faster than walking speed.
   - Therefore, walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = 1/3 of 6 hours = 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours.
   - Time spent walking = 2/3 of 6 hours = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed * time running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed * time walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

18 miles"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old. Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her usual 400 feet. So, we need to calculate three times 400 feet:

3 * 400 = 1200 feet

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:

1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"First, we need to find out how many pieces of pie there were in total. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces by multiplying the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie left. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of pieces left from the total number of pieces:

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

"First, let's figure out how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

Now, let's see how many calories you can still consume today. Your daily target is 2000 calories, and you've already eaten 1800 calories, so:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

This means you can eat 200 calories worth of chips. Since each serving is 250 calories, you can eat a little less than one full serving. To find out how many grams this is, we need to know how many grams are in one serving. The bag is 300g and has 5 servings, so:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Now, we need to find out how many grams are in 200 calories. Since 250 calories is 60g, we can set up a proportion:

250 calories : 60g = 200 calories : x grams

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:

x = (200 calories * 60g) / 250 calories
x = 12000 / 250
x = 48g

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to figure out his total costs and his total revenue, and then subtract the costs from the revenue.

First, let's find out how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles:
\[ \text{Pounds of beeswax needed} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks. Since 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Net profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

"First, let's figure out how many articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we calculate:
2/5 of 5 articles = 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than Monday.
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is:
2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the number of Post-it notes Candice originally had: 80.
2. Add the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
4. The result should be the number of Post-it notes she had left: 23.

So, the equation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 163.

"First, let's figure out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from a 4-foot piece of wire. 

First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces we can get:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

So, the distance Tom travels is:
\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, Tom travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We need to find out how long it takes him to travel 30 miles at this speed.

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

The time it takes to travel back is:
\[ \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"First, let's figure out how much weight Uriah removes by taking out 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.

30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 30/4 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. He has already removed 7.5 pounds with the comic books. Now, we need to find out how much more weight he needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the weight he needs to remove by the weight of each toy:

7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound per toy = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

- Interest rate = 2%
- Total interest = 2% of $750 = 0.02 × $750 = $15

Step 3: Total amount to be paid
- Total amount = Total cost + Total interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 4: Monthly payment
- Number of months = 3
- Monthly payment = Total amount ÷ Number of months = $765 ÷ 3 = $255

So, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total for each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Now, let's add up the totals:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

So, Artie will make $88.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.

1. The 4th level has a square footage of 16.
2. The 3rd level, being twice the square footage of the 4th level, is \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \).
3. The 2nd level, being twice the square footage of the 3rd level, is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \).
4. The 1st level, being twice the square footage of the 2nd level, is \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \).

Now, we add up the square footage of all four levels:
\[ 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

"To figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 180 days and the rest of the year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total cups for 180 days = 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

2. **Rest of the year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Days left after the first 180 days = 365 days - 180 days = 185 days.
   - The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
   - Total cups for 185 days = 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

3. **Total cups of dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Total cups = 180 cups (first 180 days) + 370 cups (remaining 185 days) = 550 cups.

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
   - Number of bags = Total cups / Cups per bag = 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"First, let's figure out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

To find David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

So:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To figure out how much Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost if he buys the flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- So, the total cost is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

Next, let's calculate the cost if he buys the flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- So, the total cost is 9 * $1 = $9.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- The cost difference is $15 - $9 = $6.

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying the flowers in packages of 2.

"First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 30% of $100. To find 30% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.30:

$100 * 0.30 = $30

This means the discount is $30. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost:

$100 - $30 = $70

So, the grooming cost is $70.

"First, let's figure out how much water the two girls got together. Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters, so:

1/6 of 24 liters = 24 / 6 = 4 liters for one girl.

Since there are two girls, they got:

4 liters + 4 liters = 8 liters together.

Now, the boy got 6 liters. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

8 liters (girls) + 6 liters (boy) = 14 liters.

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters.

"Charlie started with 10 stickers. Then he added 21 stickers from the store and 23 stickers from his birthday. That's 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers. After that, he gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card, so he gave away 9 + 28 = 37 stickers. Now, to find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we subtract the stickers he gave away from the total he had: 54 - 37 = 17 stickers.

"First, let's find out how much Alex weighs. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:

4 * 125 = 500 pounds

Now, we subtract 2 pounds to find Alex's weight:

500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Next, we add Grace's and Alex's weights to find their combined weight:

125 + 498 = 623 pounds

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we find the total number of roses:
3 rose bushes * 25 roses per bush = 75 roses

Next, we find the total number of thorns:
75 roses * 8 thorns per rose = 600 thorns

So, the total number of thorns is 600.

600"
"To solve this problem, let's use a bit of algebra. Let's say the number of games they lost is \(L\). Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is \(L + 8\).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is 22. So we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Now, let's solve for \(L\):
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won:
\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

"To find out how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to figure out how many vacations he has been on and then multiply that by the number of shirts he gets each year.

1. First, we find out how many years Gene has been going on vacations. He started at 23 and is now 34.
   - 34 - 23 = 11 years

2. Next, we know he goes on 4 vacations each year.
   - 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations

3. Since each vacation gives him one shirt, and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 44 quilt blocks.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:
4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive each year for the next three years, starting from the 5-year mark.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7200

Since Sylvie has completed 5 years, she will receive a 10% increase on her initial annual salary.

3. **First Year Increase (Year 6)**:
   - New Annual Salary = $7200 + (10% of $7200) = $7200 + $720 = $7920

4. **Second Year Increase (Year 7)**:
   - New Annual Salary = $7920 + (10% of $7920) = $7920 + $792 = $8712

5. **Third Year Increase (Year 8)**:
   - New Annual Salary = $8712 + (10% of $8712) = $8712 + $871.20 = $9583.20

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be:

$9583.20"
"Let's say Harald sold \(H\) copies. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold \(10H\) copies. Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so we can write the equation:

\[H + 10H = 88,000\]

This simplifies to:

\[11H = 88,000\]

To find \(H\), we divide both sides by 11:

\[H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000\]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

8000"
"First, we need to figure out how many gift bags Christina actually needs. Since 1/4 of the people she invites don't show up, that means 3/4 of the people will show up. 

To find out how many people will show up, we calculate 3/4 of 16:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \]

Now, Christina needs .75 gift bags per person who shows up. So, we multiply the number of people who will show up by .75:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per bag:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we can break it down into two parts: the amount for the adults and the amount for the children.

1. **Adults**: Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad. There are 20 adults.
   - So, the total for adults is \( 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \).

2. **Children**: Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( 10 \, \text{lbs} / 2 = 5 \, \text{lbs} \). There are 5 children.
   - So, the total for children is \( 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \).

3. **Total**: Add the amounts for adults and children together.
   - Total potato salad needed = \( 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \).

So, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

"First, let's figure out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet.

If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and he used to be two seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald used to run it in:
38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much faster he can run now, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract that from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds is:
0.10 * 40 seconds = 4 seconds

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in:
40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know there are two cats for every dog.
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - So, the number of cats is \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - Combined, the number of dogs and cats is \( 60 + 120 = 180 \).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - So, the number of rabbits is \( 180 - 12 = 168 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - The number of rabbits is 168.
   - The total number of pets is \( 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \).

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

This means the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
\[ 120 \times \frac{2}{3} = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before they were cooked down into sauce.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used based on the original volume.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

First, since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the original volume of tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the original volume by the volume of one can:
\[ 64 \div 16 = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total cars initially**: There were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Cars remaining after some took an exit**: 
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25 \text{ cars}

4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's call this number \( x \).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes, we can write:
\[
x + 20 = 25

For Beatrice:
- Her roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Beatrice's roll-up is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- His roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Marcell's roll-up is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups.

Next, we add the total areas to find the combined total:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\) roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the combined total by the number of people (2):

"First, we need to find out how many flowers Ryan plants in 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers each day, we multiply 2 by 15:

2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we subtract the 5 flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted:

30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

So, the number of flowers that grew is 25.

"First, let's figure out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of photos on Jamal's phone} = 6 \times \text{Number of photos on Brittany's phone} \]

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so:

\[ 1800 = 6 \times \text{Number of photos on Brittany's phone} \]

To find the number of photos on Brittany's phone, we divide both sides by 6:

\[ \text{Number of photos on Brittany's phone} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let's call the number of ducks \( d \). So we have:

\[ 300 = 50 \times d \]

To find \( d \), we divide both sides by 50:

\[ d = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is:

"First, let's figure out how much Sasha originally spent on the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Total cost for all the boards = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate how much she can sell them for after the price increase of 50%.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original price = $10.
- New price = $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original price = $16.
- New price = $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24.
- Total selling price for 5 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.

Total selling price for all the boards = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of sugar to water that Katy uses, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, let's find the total number of parts in the ratio:
7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We need to find out how many of these 120 parts are sugar.

Since the total parts in the ratio are 20, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total amount by the total number of parts:
120 / 20 = 6

Now, to find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts of sugar in the ratio:
6 * 7 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To find out how much John paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes. 

First, we find out how many pairs of shoes John bought in total. He bought 2 pairs for each of his 3 children, so:
2 pairs/child × 3 children = 6 pairs of shoes

Next, we know each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total cost is:
6 pairs × $60/pair = $360

So, John paid $360 in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of vehicles already at the port:**
   - On the first day, there were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles.
   - So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles.

2. **Determine the total number of vehicles after the second day:**
   - After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port is 30.

3. **Calculate the number of vehicles added on the second day:**
   - The number of vehicles added on the second day is \(30 - 10 = 20\) vehicles.

4. **Determine the number of containers added on the second day:**
   - Each container contains 5 vehicles.
   - So, the number of containers added on the second day is \(20 \div 5 = 4\) containers.

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"First, let's figure out what Lylah was earning four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien was earning $40,000, we can set up the equation to find Lylah's salary.

Let's call Lylah's salary four years ago \( L \).

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = L + 0.30L
$40,000 = 1.30L

Now, solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30,769.23 \]

So, Lylah was earning approximately $30,769.23 four years ago.

Next, we need to find out what Adrien's salary is now. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago.

Adrien's new salary = Adrien's old salary + 40% of Adrien's old salary
Adrien's new salary = $40,000 + 0.40 * $40,000
Adrien's new salary = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's new salary = $56,000

Now, we need to find out what Lylah's salary is now. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.

Lylah's new salary = Lylah's old salary + 40% of Lylah's old salary
Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 + 0.40 * $30,769.23
Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
Lylah's new salary = $43,076.92

Finally, we add both of their new salaries to find the total salary they are receiving four years later.

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $99,076.92

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92.

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, figure out how many sheets Miguel uses in a week. Since he uses 2 pads of paper a week and each pad has 30 sheets, we multiply 2 by 30.
   \[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

2. Next, we need to know how many weeks are in a month. For simplicity, we can assume there are about 4 weeks in a month.

3. Now, to find out how many sheets he uses in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month.
   \[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so:
   - 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours each day.
3. For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so:
   - 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours

"First, let's figure out how many miles Rosie runs in the first 3 hours. She runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so:

10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

After 3 hours, she slows down to 5 miles per hour. She has 4 hours left to run (since 7 hours total - 3 hours already run = 4 hours). So, for the next 4 hours, she runs:

5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles from both parts of her run:

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Julia bought a package of spoons. We don't know how many spoons were in this package yet, so let's call this number \( x \).
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. When she set the table, she had 12 spoons left.

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before setting the table is the number of spoons she bought plus the 5 spoons her husband bought, minus the 3 spoons she used for sampling. This can be written as:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Each pepper costs $15.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs. So, the cost of a watermelon is:
   \[
   3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of an orange**: An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. So, the cost of an orange is:

"To find out how much profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total time spent on patients per day:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Total time spent = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert the total time spent into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Calculate the total cost to the hospital:**
   - Doctors charge $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

4. **Calculate the total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

5. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of:
2 (roller coaster) + 2 (luge) = 4 rides

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of:
4 (roller coaster) + 2 (luge) = 6 rides

Now, let's add up the total number of rides they both took:
4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets they used is:
10 (total rides) × 6 (tickets per ride) = 60 tickets

"First, let's figure out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate Tuesday's miles like this:

Tuesday's miles = 6 * Monday's miles
Tuesday's miles = 6 * 4
Tuesday's miles = 24

Now we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. We can add these together to find out how many miles he walked in the first two days:

Miles on Monday and Tuesday = Monday's miles + Tuesday's miles
Miles on Monday and Tuesday = 4 + 24
Miles on Monday and Tuesday = 28

We are told that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total:

Wednesday's miles = Total miles - Miles on Monday and Tuesday
Wednesday's miles = 41 - 28
Wednesday's miles = 13

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"First, let's figure out which items are food and which are not. Milk and eggs are food items, so they don't have tax. The light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are nonfood items, so they will have a 10% tax.

The cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total for food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items before tax:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total for nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items:
10% of $10 = $10 * 0.10 = $1

So, the total cost for the nonfood items including tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

Now, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items:
$5 + $11 = $16

The total cost for everything is $16.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John has in his field at one time.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples in the field
John has 10 hectares, and each hectare has 100 pineapples.
So, \( 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \).

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
John can harvest every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year.
So, \( 12 \text{ months/year} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \).

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.
So, \( 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees half as many bees return. Half of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return.
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. Two times 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. 

To find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours, we need to figure out how many bees had left and not returned yet. 

- Initially, 30 bees left.
- Then, 15 bees returned.
- After that, 60 more bees left.

So, the total number of bees that left and had not returned before the last 6 hours is:
30 (initially left) + 60 (left later) - 15 (returned) = 75 bees.

Therefore, 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in their times is the waiting time for the winner.

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating all the tires that came by.

First, let's figure out the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- 5 people came by with bicycles, so that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents, so 10 tires * 25 cents/tire = 250 cents.

Next, the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came by with tricycles, so that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents, so 9 tires * 25 cents/tire = 225 cents.

Finally, the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came by with a unicycle, so that's 1 tire.
- Each tire costs 25 cents, so 1 tire * 25 cents/tire = 25 cents.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = 250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 500 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
- 500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"First, let's figure out how many cookies Carl has in total. Since he buys ten packs and each pack has six cookies, we multiply:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we need to find out how much all the cookies cost. Each cookie costs $0.10, so:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so to find out how much change he gets, we subtract the total cost from $10:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, Carl receives $4.00 in change.

$4.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. **Dave ate 14 fries.**
2. **The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:**
   - Seagull ate \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:**
   - Total fries eaten by pigeons = \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. **After the seagull and pigeons, the remaining fries:**
   - Total fries eaten by Dave, seagull, and pigeons = \( 14 + 7 + 9 = 30 \) fries.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of fries initially.
   - Remaining fries = \( x - 30 \).
5. **A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:**
   - Raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining fries.
   - Remaining fries after raccoon = \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining fries.
   - Let \( y \) be the remaining fries after the seagull and pigeons.
   - \( y = x - 30 \).
   - Remaining fries after raccoon = \( \frac{1}{3} \times y = \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) \).
6. **Ants carried off one fry, leaving five behind:**
   - Remaining fries after ants = \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x - 30 = 18
\]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[
x = 48
\]

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was:

48"
"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the days he has classes:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours for these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours for these days is:
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Now, let's add the total hours for all the days in a week:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Next, we multiply the total weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

So, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes.

"To find out how long all the baked goods will be when put end to end, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together. We need to make sure all the lengths are in the same unit, so we'll convert everything to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.
   - Convert inches to feet: \( 1200 \div 12 = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - There are 120 croissants.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.
   - Convert inches to feet: \( 720 \div 12 = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - There are 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes in feet: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Now, add the total lengths of all the baked goods:
- Total length in feet: \( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet.

"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas all the apes need in one month. 

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Adding these together gives us the total number of bananas needed per month:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly total by 2:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To solve this, we need to figure out how far Blake and Kelly each ran and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how far Blake ran:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Running back and forth once means running 100 yards to the end and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he runs \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly ran:
- Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back. This means she runs 40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back, which is 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times, so she runs \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.

Now, we find the difference in the distance they ran:
- Blake ran 3000 yards.
- Kelly ran 2720 yards.
- The difference is \( 3000 - 2720 = 280 \) yards.

"To find out how much Raphael spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items he bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens:
- He bought 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5.
- So, the total cost for the pens is \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- He bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4.
- So, the total cost for the notebooks is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

Finally, the cost of the rim of bond paper is $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
- Total cost = 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 dollars

So, Raphael spent a total of 34 dollars.

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months with a 20% increase every two months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step.

1. First, determine how many 2-month periods are in 36 months:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

2. Each period, the price increases by 20% of the original price. This means the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20%) each period.

3. The formula to calculate the final price after 18 periods is:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

4. Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

5. Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
   \]

6. Now, multiply the original price by this factor:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 = 766.752

"To figure out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the money she would lose by doing the taxes herself.

1. Calculate the total money lost if Jackie does the taxes herself:
   - She loses 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour.
   - Total money lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

2. Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. Compare the two:
   - Money lost by doing taxes herself: $105
   - Cost of hiring the accountant: $90

4. Determine the difference:
   - Difference = Money lost by doing taxes herself - Cost of hiring the accountant
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to figure out how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/session = 5 sessions

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for the 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's figure this out step by step. If Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can say Seth's age is 2 times Brooke's age. Let's call Brooke's age B. So Seth's age is 2B.

In 2 years, Seth will be 2B + 2 years old, and Brooke will be B + 2 years old. The problem says that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can write the equation:

(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Now, let's solve for B:

2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28
3B + 4 = 28
3B = 28 - 4
3B = 24
B = 24 / 3
B = 8

Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is:

2 * 8 = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let's denote the total cost as \( C \).
   - The total revenue \( R \) is the profit plus the total cost: \( R = C + 25 \).

2. **Determine the number of gallons sold:**
   - Each gallon makes 20 glasses.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50.
   - Therefore, the revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons sold.
   - The total revenue \( R \) is also \( 10G \).

3. **Set up the equation for total revenue:**
   - From step 1, \( R = C + 25 \).
   - From step 2, \( R = 10G \).
   - Therefore, \( 10G = C + 25 \).

4. **Calculate the total cost \( C \):**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - The total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
   - The total cost for \( G \) gallons is \( 5G \).
   - Therefore, \( C = 5G \).

5. **Substitute \( C \) in the revenue equation:**
   - \( 10G = 5G + 25 \).

6. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Subtract \( 5G \) from both sides: \( 5G = 25 \).
   - Divide by 5: \( G = 5 \).

7. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

So, the amount spent on lemons is:

"First, let's figure out how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

Zaid's salary is $6000.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, let's add these expenses to find the total amount spent on rent and car fuel:
\[ 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money is left after these expenses:
\[ 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

So, the amount left after the donation is:
\[ 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]

"To find out how many votes the loser got, we first need to figure out how many votes the winner received. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. Since 80 students voted, we can calculate the winner's votes like this:

Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80

Now, let's calculate that:

Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80 = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, we can find the number of votes the loser got by subtracting the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60

Now, let's do the subtraction:

Loser's votes = 80 - 60 = 20

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20.

3. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, half of Jan's age two years ago is 28 / 2 = 14.
4. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.
5. If Mark was 19 years old two years ago, then Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.
6. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

### Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team)
Each member of Team 1 runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for Team 1 is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team)
For Team 2, the times for each runner are as follows:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for Team 2 is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Times
The difference in the total times between the two teams is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team (Team 1) will win by:
\[ 2 \text{ seconds} \]

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ \text{Probability of rolling a number greater than 3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

\[ \text{Probability of rolling an even number} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[ \text{Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row} = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage difference} = 0.25 \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. **Rats**: There are 3 cages, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
2. **Hamsters**: There are 10 cages, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
3. **Rabbits**: 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
4. **Total straw**: 160 pieces of straw are distributed in total.

First, let's calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters.
- Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

Next, let's calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:
- Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's find out how much straw is used for the rats:
- Total straw used = 160 pieces.
- Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces.
- Straw used for rabbits = 20 pieces.
- Straw used for rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw.

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's find out the total number of rats:
- Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- Total number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

There are 3 cages of rats, and the rats are distributed equally among the cages:
- Number of rats per cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest of 2%, we need to calculate the interest for each month and add it to the original amount.

1. **First Month:**
   - Original amount: $100
   - Interest for the first month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
   - Total after the first month: $100 + $2 = $102

2. **Second Month:**
   - New amount: $102
   - Interest for the second month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
   - Total after the second month: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

3. **Third Month:**
   - New amount: $104.04
   - Interest for the third month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.08
   - Total after the third month: $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12 after 3 months.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, let's break down the costs and profits step by step.

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: The trader buys each bag for $20.
2. **Transport cost per bag**: It costs $2 to transport each bag.
3. **Total cost per bag**: The total cost for each bag is $20 (buying) + $2 (transport) = $22.
4. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. **Profit per bag**: The profit for each bag is $30 (selling price) - $22 (total cost) = $8.
6. **Total profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400.

To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"First, let's figure out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since the tickets cost $20.25, the food cost:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, and each ride cost $33:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Tickets: $20.25
- Food: $15.75
- Rides: $66

Total cost:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since there are 3 friends, they split the total cost evenly:
\[ 102 \div 3 = 34 \]

Each friend paid:
\[ 34 \]

"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends collecting peaches and then multiply that by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

1. First, we know John collects peaches for 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Next, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. So, we multiply the total number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute:
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches}
   \]

So, John collects 360 peaches.

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects they need for a week and then divide that by 7 days.

1. First, calculate the total weekly need for the flock:
   - Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
   - For 10 ducks: \( 3.5 \times 10 = 35 \) pounds per week.

2. Now, divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need:
   - \( 35 \div 7 = 5 \) pounds per day.

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
3. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.
4. So, after 10 years, the total number of trees is \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
5. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, 30% of 130 trees die, which is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
6. The number of trees left after 30% die is \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number:
   - 3 times 20 = 60 cards
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month:
   - 60 - 20 = 40 cards
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months:
   - Combined number of cards in the first and second months: 60 + 40 = 100 cards
   - Twice that number: 2 * 100 = 200 cards

Now, let's add up all the cards she has:
- Initial cards: 20
- Cards collected in the first month: 60

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total payment from both publishers.

First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. So, for 500 sentences, Publisher A pays:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays per sentence, which is:
2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence

So, for 500 sentences, Publisher B pays:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the payments from both publishers gives us Mark's total weekly earnings:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find out how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to calculate his total earnings from both his salary and the monetary reward.

1. **Calculate the total salary for the year before the raise:**
   - John makes $2000 a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, his annual salary before the raise is \( 2000 \times 52 = 104,000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise:**
   - A 5% raise on $2000 is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars.
   - So, his new weekly salary is \( 2000 + 100 = 2100 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total salary for the year after the raise:**
   - Since the raise is effective from the first day of the year, his new weekly salary of $2100 applies to all 52 weeks.
   - So, his annual salary after the raise is \( 2100 \times 52 = 109,200 \) dollars.

4. **Add the one-time monetary reward:**
   - The one-time monetary reward is $5000.

5. **Calculate the total earnings for the year:**
   - Total earnings = Annual salary after the raise + One-time monetary reward
   - Total earnings = \( 109,200 + 5000 = 114,200 \) dollars.

So, John made $114,200 that year.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we first need to understand how the lowest score is removed and how the average is calculated.

Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score among these is 71. We will exclude this score when calculating the average.

First, we calculate the sum of the remaining scores:
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Let's call the score on the sixth test \( x \). After the sixth test, the lowest score will be either 71 or \( x \), depending on which is lower. We need to consider both cases to ensure the average is 93.

### Case 1: \( x \) is the lowest score
If \( x \) is the lowest score, the sum of the other five scores will be 367, and the average of these five scores should be 93:
\[
\frac{367 + x - x}{5} = 93
\]
\[
\frac{367}{5} = 93
\]
This is not possible because 367 divided by 5 is 73.4, which is not 93. Therefore, \( x \) cannot be the lowest score.

### Case 2: 71 is the lowest score
If 71 is the lowest score, the sum of the other five scores will be 367 + \( x \), and the average of these five scores should be 93:
\[
\frac{367 + x - 71}{5} = 93
\]
\[
\frac{296 + x}{5} = 93
\]
Multiply both sides by 5:
\[
296 + x = 465
\]
Subtract 296 from both sides:
\[
x = 169
\]

So, Brinley needs to score 169 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

125 kilometers/week * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the kilometers he rode in the following three weeks. He rode 2 times a week and each time he rode 60 kilometers.

So, for one week, he rode:
2 times * 60 kilometers = 120 kilometers

For three weeks, he rode:
120 kilometers/week * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

"To find out how much Joe's bag of candy weighs, we need to calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, we can find the total weight of the chocolate bars by multiplying the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each one:
25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, we can find the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the number of candied apples by the weight of each one:
80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups are 240 cups (because one dozen equals 12 cups):

\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

The cost of one cup is then:

\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"First, let's figure out how much money Sara needs in total to buy the jacket and the shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so that's 2 * $20 = $40.

So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, she needs $60 - $20 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs by what she earns per lawn mowed:

$40 / $4 = 10

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say the number of red chickens Jerry has is \( R \). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( R + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from the red chickens is \( 3R \).

Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from the white chickens is \( 5(R + 2) \).

Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Now, let's add up the customers from the first two days:
100 (first day) + 150 (second day) = 250 customers.

To find out how many customers came on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers over the three days:
500 (total) - 250 (first two days) = 250 customers.

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons).
   - Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons).

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know that 4 minutes ago, both pools were losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
   - Therefore, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.
   - Similarly, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

3. **Use the Given Information:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B + 16 = 2(S + 16)

   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2S + 32
     \]
   - Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
     \[
     2S + 16 = 32
     \]
   - Subtract 16 from both sides:
     \[
     2S = 16
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     S = 8
     \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. So, the total cost is:
\[ 320 + 32 = 352 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ 352 \div 8 = 44 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

44"
"First, let's figure out how much Janeth has to pay back in total. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. 

10% of $2000 is $200 (because 10/100 * 2000 = 200).

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, if she pays $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find out her remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay back:

$2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220.
220"
"To find out how many flowers are in the vase in total, we first need to figure out how many dahlias there are. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can add 7 to the number of roses to get the number of dahlias.

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias together.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"First, let's figure out the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's age.

Harriet is 21 years old now. Since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
Adrian's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years

Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:
Zack's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years

Now, we need to find their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

"First, let's figure out how many points each person scored:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

"First, we need to find out how much water was left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. 

The tank originally had 120 liters. After using 90 liters, the amount left is:
120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the rainwater collected is:
2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank:
30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the tank now has 90 liters of water.

90"
"First, let's figure out how many petunias Andy plants. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Since he plants 90 geraniums, we subtract 40 from 90 to find the number of petunias:

"To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the cost for each of them and then add those costs together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- So, the cost for Carlos is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- So, the cost for Benji is \(18 \times 5 = 90\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = 90 + 90 = 180 dollars

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is 180 dollars.

"First, let's figure out how many Pokemon cards James has in total after losing and buying some cards.

He starts with:
- 30 fire type
- 20 grass type
- 40 water type

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type

After buying 14 more grass type cards, he has:
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type

Now, let's add up all the cards he has:
- 30 fire type
- 34 grass type
- 32 water type

Total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is 33%.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together in one minute.
   - Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
   - Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is \(4 \div 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.
   - Together, they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

2. Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces.
   - If they place 6 pieces per minute, the total time in minutes is \(360 \div 6 = 60\) minutes.

3. Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \(60 \div 60 = 1\) hour.

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, let's figure out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. Since Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert, we can calculate:

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Now, on Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So we calculate:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

2. Each time he uses up 5 pens, he can make 1 new pen from the leftover ink.

First, he uses up the 25 pens:
- 25 pens / 5 = 5 new pens

Now, he has 5 new pens:
- 5 pens / 5 = 1 new pen

Now, he has 1 new pen:

"First, let's figure out how many pen pals Mike still has. He started with 5 and stopped being pen pals with 2, so:

5 - 2 = 3 pen pals

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:

3 pen pals * 2 letters/pen pal * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week.

"To find out how many fish are in each aquarium, let's start by figuring out the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums.

The first aquarium has 4 snails, and the second aquarium has 32 snails. The difference between these two numbers is:
32 - 4 = 28 snails

According to the problem, this difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let's call the total number of fish in both aquariums \( F \). So, we can write the equation:
28 = 2F

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
F = 28 / 2
F = 14

This means there are 14 fish in total in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we divide this number by 2 to find the number of fish in each aquarium:
14 / 2 = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

- Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:

   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today:**
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today:
- Last night, Rick killed 15 cougars.
- Today, he killed 3 fewer cougars than last night.
- So, today he killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars.

Next, let's find out how many wolves Rick killed today:
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

Total animals killed:

"First, let's figure out how many times Anne went down the slide. If Mitchel went down 30 times and Anne went 30% less, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30.

30% of 30 is:
0.30 * 30 = 9

So, Anne went down the slide:
30 - 9 = 21 times

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:

21 * 4 = 84

Robert went down the slide 84 times.
84"
"First, let's figure out how many cows Mr. Sylas adds to each stall. He bought 40 cows and divided them equally among 20 stalls. So, we divide 40 by 20:

40 ÷ 20 = 2

This means Mr. Sylas added 2 cows to each stall. Each stall originally had 20 cows, so now each stall has:

20 + 2 = 22 cows

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 22 cows, we multiply 22 by 8:

22 × 8 = 176

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 176.

"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and the dollar bills, and then add them all together.

1. **Pennies**: 100 pennies = 100 * $0.01 = $1.00
2. **Nickels**: 40 nickels = 40 * $0.05 = $2.00
3. **Dimes**: 20 dimes = 20 * $0.10 = $2.00
4. **Dollar bills**: 40 dollar bills = 40 * $1.00 = $40.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank.

"First, let's figure out how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot tall redwood tree. We do this by dividing the total height by the length of each section:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Next, we need to find out the total weight of the tree before the termites ate any of it. We do this by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to find out how much of the tree was eaten by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree, so we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

To find the weight of the tree after the termites ate part of it, we subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten from the original weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of it is 5600 pounds.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Andrea's Apples**: Andrea has 52 apples.
2. **Jamal's Apples**: Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from Andrea's apples.
   - Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

3. **Jamal's Bananas**: Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

4. **Andrea's Bananas**: Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

5. **Total Fruits**:
   - Andrea's total fruits = 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.
   - Jamal's total fruits = 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.
   - Total fruits together = 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to figure out how many dozens of cookies she is making each day.

For today:
- Carla is making 36 cookies.
- Since 12 cookies make a dozen, 36 cookies are 36 / 12 = 3 dozens.

For tomorrow:
- Carla is making 30 cookies.
- 30 cookies are 30 / 12 = 2.5 dozens.

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed for one dozen cookies.

For today:
- 3 dozens of cookies will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour.

For tomorrow:
- 2.5 dozens of cookies will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour.

Adding the flour needed for both days:
- 6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups of flour.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup.

The total number of pennies in the cup is 9,300. 

To find two thirds of 9,300, we multiply 9,300 by 2/3:
\[ 9,300 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6,200 \]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since 100 pennies make up 1 dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100 to find the dollar amount:
\[ 6,200 \div 100 = 62 \]

The total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars.

"First, let's figure out the total cost of the house including the fees.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add all these costs together to get the total price:
\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price is than her budget:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"To find out how much Mr. Tan's net proceeds are from selling the house, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   - Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   - Selling price = $400,000
   - Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - Brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   - Total expenses = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses
   - Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

"First, let's figure out how long it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, and then it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes

So, the time to heat up to 400 degrees is:
20 + 8 = 28 minutes

Next, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil to 400 degrees. So the cooking time is:
28 - 5 = 23 minutes

Now, we add the time to heat the oil to the cooking time to find the total time:
28 + 23 = 51 minutes

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The cost of one newspaper ad is $5.
- The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
- So, the total cost for newspaper ads is \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The cost of one television ad is $75.
- The real estate agent bought 15 television ads.
- So, the total cost for television ads is \( 75 \times 15 = 1125 \) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of newspaper ads + Cost of television ads
- Total cost = 250 + 1125 = 1375 dollars

So, the real estate agent spent a total of 1375 dollars on buying all the ads.

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we can break it down step by step:

1. **Windows in the bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - So, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

2. **Additional windows in each house:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows.
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

3. **Total windows in both houses:**

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body, so it takes \(900 \div 10 = 90\) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. Since the total number of stitches is 1800, the number of stitches for the sleeves is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes:
\[ 630 \div 2 = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines in the lyrics.
   - All 54 lines are his to memorize.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - So, the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - So, the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
   - Solo song: 54 lines
   - First scene: 36 lines

"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the 80 cards had the letter A:

80 * 2/5 = 32 cards

Now, we subtract the 32 cards with the letter A from the total to find out how many cards are left:

80 - 32 = 48 cards

Next, 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B:

48 * 1/2 = 24 cards

Subtract the 24 cards with the letter B from the 48 cards to find out how many are left:

48 - 24 = 24 cards

Then, 5/8 of the rest (24 cards) had the letter C:

24 * 5/8 = 15 cards

"To find out how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- For 30 small holes, it will take \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- For 15 large holes, it will take \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes:
- Total time in minutes: \(90 + 150 = 240\) minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"Let's use some algebra to solve this problem. We can set up two equations based on the information given.

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now. If we let Sam's age be \( S \) and Ruby's age be \( R \), then we can write the equation:
   \[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, in 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). The equation for this situation is:
   \[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter bought 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- So, the total cost for the popsicles is 20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter bought 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is 4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00.

So, Peter paid $7.00 in total.

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children.

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars will be shared equally among them.

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"First, let's figure out how long Susan works. She starts at 8 a.m. and ends at 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. But she takes a half-hour break, so she works for 2.5 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours into minutes because we know she earns money every 10 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2.5 hours is 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many times she earns $5. So, 150 / 10 = 15.

Finally, we multiply the number of times she earns $5 by $5 to find out her total earnings: 15 * $5 = $75.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Points after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point: 18 points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

4. **Sum of all points:**
   - Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\)

"First, let's figure out how old the youngest son is. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so:

Youngest son's age = 8 / 2 = 4 years old

Now, let's see how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes as many oranges as his age, which is 8 oranges. The youngest son washes as many oranges as his age, which is 4 oranges.

Total oranges washed = 8 (oldest son) + 4 (youngest son) = 12 oranges

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is:

15 (total oranges) - 12 (washed oranges) = 3 oranges

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 5 people eating rice twice a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Divide the total amount of rice in the bag by the weekly consumption to find out how many weeks it will last.

Step 1: Total rice consumed per meal
Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
For 5 people, the total rice consumed per meal is:
0.2 kg/person * 5 people = 1 kg

Step 2: Total rice consumed per day
Since they eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), the total rice consumed per day is:
1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day

Step 3: Total rice consumed per week
There are 7 days in a week, so the total rice consumed per week is:
2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week

Step 4: How many weeks the 42 kg bag will last
To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

2. Each bid increases by $50.
3. Three other people each bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them.

Let's break it down:

- The first person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
- Carmen then bids $250 + $50 = $300.
- The second person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
- Carmen then bids $350 + $50 = $400.

"To find out how much John pays a year for the driving service, we need to break down the costs:

1. **Mileage Cost:**
   - John travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back each day, so that's 60 miles per day.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.
   - The cost per mile is $2, so the total mileage cost is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

2. **Bonus Cost:**
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus cost is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the driving service is the sum of the mileage cost and the bonus cost.
   - Total cost = $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year.

So, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to figure out how many books she sold that year and then multiply by the price per book.

1. **Total books initially**: 250
2. **Books sold in the current year (third year)**: 45
3. **Books unsold**: 50

First, let's find out how many books were sold in the first two years combined:
- Total books sold = Total books initially - Books unsold
- Total books sold = 250 - 50 = 200

Next, we know the number of books sold in the first year:
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold in the current year
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * 45 = 90

Now, we can find out how many books were sold in the second year:
- Books sold in the second year = Total books sold - (Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the current year)
- Books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
- Money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
- Money earned in the second year = 65 * 20 = 1300

"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his earnings from the hourly wage:
- Watson works 10 hours each day.
- He works 5 days a week.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his weekly earnings from the hourly wage are:
10 hours/day * 5 days/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Next, let's calculate his total earnings from the hourly wage for the month of April:
- April typically has about 4 weeks.
- So, his monthly earnings from the hourly wage are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Now, let's add the weekly bonus:
- Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
- Since the company performed very well for the whole month, he gets the bonus every week.

So, his total bonus for the month is:
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Finally, let's add his monthly earnings from the hourly wage and the bonus:
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

So, Watson made $3200 in April.

80% of 20 = 0.80 * 20 = 16

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

20 - 16 = 4

"First, let's figure out how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. Now, let's find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.

\[ \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves left.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we divide this number by 2 to find out how many are sold in the afternoon.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

"First, let's figure out how much weight Joey loses in one week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, then in one week, Joey loses:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. So, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we can set up a proportion. If 2 pounds take 4 weeks, then 8 pounds will take:

(8 pounds / 2 pounds) * 4 weeks = 4 * 4 weeks = 16 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

   - Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
   - Savings for 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4

2. **Calculate the savings on the milk:**
   - Discount per packet of milk: $0.5
   - Savings for 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

3. **Total savings:**
   - Total savings = Savings on ice cream + Savings on milk

"To figure out how many new limbs the person will grow, we need to break it down into arms and legs.

First, let's look at the arms:
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, the number of new arms is 15 divided by 3, which equals 5 new arms.

Next, let's look at the legs:
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, the number of new legs is 15 divided by 5, which equals 3 new legs.

Now, we add the new arms and legs together:
- 5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs.

So, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, let's find out how much the flight ticket costs. The ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so we need to subtract his total expenses and savings from his initial amount:
$6000 - $1950 (expenses) - $2000 (savings) = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).
2. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
3. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier to solve, multiply every term by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the ratio given and the total number of electric wires.

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

If the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool her coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total amount by which the coffee is weakened.

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:
     \[
     \frac{65}{13} = 5

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - So, the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   - So, the number of senior programmers is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

3. **Determine the monthly pay for senior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.
   - So, the monthly pay for each senior programmer is \( 2000 + 400 = 2400 \).

4. **Calculate the total monthly pay for junior programmers:**
   - The number of junior programmers is 40.
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - So, the total monthly pay for junior programmers is \( 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \).

5. **Calculate the total monthly pay for senior programmers:**
   - The number of senior programmers is 60.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $2400 per month.

2. At the first stop, 5 more people got in, so now there are \( x + 5 \) people on the bus.
3. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 got on. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

We know that after the second stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So we can set up the equation:

\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20 \]
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:

\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \( 24 - 2 = 22 \) lollipops left.
3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \( 22 - 14 = 8 \) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 lollipops, so he buys:
   \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) lollipops.
5. Adding the new lollipops to the ones he has left:
   \( 8 + 28 = 36 \) lollipops.
6. He eats 3 lollipops that night:
   \( 36 - 3 = 33 \) lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \( 33 - 2 = 31 \) lollipops left.

So, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

"To solve this, we need to figure out how much more charge the phone needs and then how long it will take to get that charge.

1. The phone is currently at 60% and needs to reach 100%. So, it needs 40% more charge.
2. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point every 3 minutes. To find out how long it takes to charge 40 percentage-points, we multiply 40 by 3 minutes:
   \[
   40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"First, let's figure out how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they get $1 off. So, $80 divided by $20 is 4, which means they earned $4 in rewards.

This shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 in rewards, and the coupon took off twice the amount of the rewards, which is $4 times 2, equaling $8.

So, the total discount is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

Now, subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"First, let's figure out how much Nick would make from each job after taxes.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Taxes: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000

"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can break it down into two parts: the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge.

First, for the suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch.
- For 8 batches, he will need \(30 \times 8 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

Next, for the fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch.
- For 1 batch, he will need \(70 \times 1 = 70\) ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the sugar needed for both the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces.

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total.

"First, let's figure out how much Maria paid for the 8 shares. She bought each share for $8, so for 8 shares, she paid:

8 shares * $8/share = $64

Next, the stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share, we calculate:

$8 * 50% = $8 * 0.50 = $4

So the new price per share after the first year is:

$8 + $4 = $12

Now, in the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. We need to find 25% of the new price:

$12 * 25% = $12 * 0.25 = $3

So the price per share after the decrease is:

$12 - $3 = $9

Finally, to find the total value of all Maria's shares after the second year, we multiply the new price per share by the number of shares:

8 shares * $9/share = $72

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72.

"Let's break this down step by step. We know there are 200 students in total, and they are split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups \( x \). This means the smallest group has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students can be represented as:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of cows and chickens:**
   - Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
   - Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

2. **Set up the equation for the total number of animals:**
   - The total number of animals is 60.
   - So, \( C + 2C = 60 \).

3. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - Combine like terms: \( 3C = 60 \).
   - Divide both sides by 3: \( C = 20 \).

4. **Find the number of chickens:**
   - Since the number of chickens is \( 2C \), the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of legs:**
   - Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

6. **Add the legs together:**
   - Total legs = legs from cows + legs from chickens = 80 + 80 = 160.

So, the total number of legs is 160.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds

"First, let's figure out the total time John spent on his activities.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time for boating and swimming is:
6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) = 9 hours

He also watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so:
3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
9 hours (boating and swimming) + 6 hours (shows) = 15 hours

We know that the 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. To find the total time, we can set up the equation:
15 hours = 30% of total time
15 hours = 0.30 * total time

To find the total time, we divide both sides by 0.30:
Total time = 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of his total time:

This $2 is half of the change he had after buying the candy, so the total change he had was:

$2 * 2 = $4

Now, we know Billy started with $10 and had $4 left as change after buying the candy. So, the amount he spent on candy is:

"First, let's figure out the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs of the trip.

The combined distance of the first two legs is:
75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles

So, the distance from the third city to the first city is:
175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles

Now, let's add up all the distances to get the total distance for one complete trip:
75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
300 miles/trip × 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total service distance by the distance traveled in one day:
18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks:**
   - 3 people

2. **Number of people kicked out for shoplifting:**
   - This is four times the number of people who refused to wear masks, minus 5.
   - \( 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \) people

3. **Number of people kicked out for physical violence:**
   - This is three times the number of shoplifters.
   - \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) people

4. **Total number of people kicked out:**
   - 50 people

5. **Number of people kicked out for other reasons:**
   - Total number of people kicked out minus the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.
   - \( 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19 \) people

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19.

"To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara.
2. Sara has 8 points.
3. Three times Sara's points is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).
4. This means Erin has 24 points after scoring 14 points.
5. To find out how many points Erin had before, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her total points: \(24 - 14 = 10\).

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To find out how much will be spent on the senior gifts, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames: \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of etching:**
   - Each frame needs to be etched, which adds 20% to the cost.
   - 20% of $20 is \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for etching per frame: \( 20 + 4 = 24 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for etching all frames: \( 44 \times 24 = 1056 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins.
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers: \( \frac{44}{4} = 11 \) seniors.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords: \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost:**
   - Add up all the costs:
   - Total cost for picture frames and etching: $1056
   - Total cost for pins: $10
   - Total cost for cords: $132
   - Total cost: \( 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \) dollars.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

"To find out how much Ethan saved by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate 20% of the market price of $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
20/100 * 400 = 0.2 * 400 = $80

This means Ethan saved $80 by making it himself. To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the market price:

$400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday. So, they sold \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. On Sunday, they sold half the amount they sold on Saturday. So, they sold \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs.
4. However, on Sunday, 6 pairs were returned. So, the net sales for Sunday are \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, let's add up the total sales for the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold: \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\)

"To find out how much money was spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the value of the faulty equipment and then subtract that from the total amount spent.

1. Calculate the value of the faulty equipment:
   - 40% of the total equipment is faulty.
   - 40% of $400,000 = 0.40 * $400,000 = $160,000

2. Subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total amount spent:
   - Total amount spent = $400,000
   - Value of faulty equipment = $160,000
   - Amount spent on functioning equipment = $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000. 

$240,000"
"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break it down like this:

- Mary has 30 sheep in total.
- Half of them, which is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep, give 1 kg of milk each.
- The other half, also 15 sheep, give 2 kg of milk each.

Now, we calculate the total milk from each group:
- From the first group (15 sheep), she gets 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg of milk.
- From the second group (15 sheep), she gets 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg of milk.

Adding both amounts together gives the total milk collected:
- Total milk = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56.
   - Each apple is sold for $4.
   - Number of apples sold on Monday = Total money earned / Price per apple = $56 / $4 = 14 apples.

2. **Apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Apples picked on Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday = 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

4. **Total apples picked over the three days:**
   - Total apples = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first figure out how many socks she has washed. 

1. A pair of socks means 2 socks. So, 10 pairs of socks mean:
   10 pairs × 2 socks/pair = 20 socks

2. Lindsay also washed 15 loose socks.

3. Adding the socks from pairs and the loose socks together:
   20 socks + 15 socks = 35 socks

4. Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many she missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks:
   50 socks - 35 socks = 15 socks

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total amount she will owe after the interest is added. The interest is calculated on the principal amount, which is $3,650, at a rate of 10% for five months.

First, we calculate the interest for one year and then for five months:
- Annual interest rate = 10%
- Interest for one year = 10% of $3,650 = 0.10 * $3,650 = $365

Since the loan is for five months, we need to find the interest for five months:
- Interest for five months = (5/12) * $365 = $152.08 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, we add this interest to the principal to find the total amount to be repaid:
- Total amount = Principal + Interest = $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08

Karan has to pay this total amount in equal monthly installments over five months:
- Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months = $3,802.08 / 5 = $760.42

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month.

"First, let's figure out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. She can make 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Millie makes by selling all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar per cup} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate her profit. Profit is the total money made minus the cost of supplies. The cost of supplies is $18, so:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} - 18 \text{ dollars} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we need to know how many hours it takes her to sell all 36 cups. She sells 4 cups per hour, so:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \div 4 \text{ cups per hour} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we divide the total profit by the number of hours to find the profit per hour:
\[ 18 \text{ dollars} \div 9 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

So, Millie makes a profit of $2 per hour.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to figure out what 3/5 of his land is and then add that to the 12.8 hectares he has left.

1. First, we know that 12.8 hectares is 2/5 of his land because if he sold 3/5, he has 2/5 left.
2. To find out what 1/5 of his land is, we divide 12.8 by 2:
   \[
   12.8 \div 2 = 6.4 \text{ hectares}
   \]
3. Now, to find the total land, we multiply 6.4 hectares by 5 (since 5/5 is the whole land):
   \[
   6.4 \times 5 = 32 \text{ hectares}
   \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

On the day of the performance, only the girls are performing. But half of them can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, we need to find half of 26:

26 / 2 = 13 girls can't make it

This means the other half of the girls, which is also 13, do make it to the performance. Then, the 3 teachers join them. So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls who made it:

13 + 3 = 16

So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 16.

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to compare the cost of the ride bracelet to the cost of buying individual ride tickets for 9 rides.

First, let's calculate the cost of 9 rides using individual tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- So, the cost for one ride is 2 tickets * $2 per ticket = $4.
- For 9 rides, the total cost is 9 rides * $4 per ride = $36.

Now, let's look at the cost of the ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of 9 individual ride tickets:
- Savings = Cost of 9 individual ride tickets - Cost of ride bracelet
- Savings = $36 - $30 = $6

So, David saves $6.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to figure out how many popsicles each of them has based on the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

The total number of popsicles is 165. To find out how many popsicles each part represents, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"First, let's figure out how much Tim spends on the streaming services.

1. Netflix costs $10 a month.
2. Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling them.

The total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus without the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

The discount he gets is 20%, so the discount amount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost for Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is:

"First, let's figure out how many slices Bill and Mark get.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
1/3 of 12 slices = 12 / 3 = 4 slices for Bill.

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So:
1/4 of 12 slices = 12 / 4 = 3 slices for Mark.

Now, let's add up the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is:
7 slices (Bill and Mark) + 2 slices (Jenny) = 9 slices.

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten or given away from the total number of slices:
12 slices (total) - 9 slices (eaten or given away) = 3 slices left.

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
2. Multiply the monthly working days by the number of months in a year to get the total working days in a year.
3. Multiply the total working days in a year by the daily pay to get the yearly earnings.

Step 1: The builder works 6 days every week and there are 4 weeks in a month.
So, the number of days worked in a month = 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month.

Step 2: There are 12 months in a year.
So, the total number of days worked in a year = 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.

"First, let's figure out how much energy Mel uses with the air conditioner each day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts, which is the same as 0.9 kilowatts (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts).

If Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the energy used each day is:
0.9 kilowatts * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours

If Mel reduces the time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day

The energy used with the reduced time is:
0.9 kilowatts * 3 hours = 2.7 kilowatt-hours

The energy saved each day is:
7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
2. One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
3. One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average:
\[88 \div 4 = 22\]

"To figure out how much Tyson will spend on the meat and cheese, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Tyson needs to serve 20 people.
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - So, the number of sandwiches needed is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, he will need \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds of meat and \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds of cheese.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - For 5 pounds, the cost is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - For 5 pounds, the cost is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.
   - Total cost = \( 35 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

So, Tyson will spend $50 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, let's figure out how many corns Allan originally has. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, he must have:

40 cannolis * 2 = 80 corns

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is:

40 cannolis + 60 cannolis = 100 cannolis

Now, Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis, so he buys:

100 cannolis - 40 = 60 corns

Adding these 60 corns to the original 80 corns, the new total of corns is:

80 corns + 60 corns = 140 corns

Finally, to find the combined total of corns and cannolis, we add the new totals together:

140 corns + 100 cannolis = 240

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He already did half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he did 5,000 steps. Then, he did another 1,000 steps walking with his friend. So, before his jog, he had done 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps done by the end of his jog. Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"First, let's figure out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, the time it takes to read the book is:
\[ 9000 \text{ words} \div 300 \text{ words/minute} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, the total time he needs to leave by is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading and have:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To find out how much the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Each employee works 40 hours a week.
   - Each employee earns $15 per hour.
   - There are 40 employees.
   - The total payment for one employee in a week is \( 40 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 600 \text{ dollars} \).
   - The total payment for all employees in a week is \( 600 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 24,000 \text{ dollars} \).
   - Since there are 4 weeks in May, the total payment for May is \( 24,000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 96,000 \text{ dollars} \).

2. **Calculate the number of employees in June:**
   - In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.
   - The number of employees whose contracts expired is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).
   - The number of employees remaining in June is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - The total payment for one employee in a week is still \( 600 \text{ dollars} \).
   - The total payment for all employees in a week is \( 600 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 18,000 \text{ dollars} \).
   - Since there are 4 weeks in June, the total payment for June is \( 18,000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72,000 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   - The total payment for May and June is \( 96,000 \text{ dollars} + 72,000 \text{ dollars} = 168,000 \text{ dollars} \).

"First, let's figure out how much Sally spent on the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs half of $3, which is $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, she bought 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. The total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all her expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenses from $10:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, Sally has $3.00 left.

"First, let's figure out how much the second pack of fireworks costs. It's twice the cost of the first pack, which is $400, so:

Second pack cost = 2 * $400 = $800

Now, let's add the cost of the first pack and the second pack together:

Total cost of packs = $400 + $800 = $1200

Tim gets a 20% discount on these packs, so let's calculate the discount amount:

Discount = 20% of $1200 = 0.20 * $1200 = $240

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost of the packs to find out how much he pays for them:

Cost after discount = $1200 - $240 = $960

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the cost after the discount:

Total cost = $960 + $150 = $1110

So, Tim spent a total of $1110. 

$1110"
"To figure out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. So, for 30 days, she will eat:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies at a time, and 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of candles that are expected to explode.
2. Determine the number of candles that are both expected to explode and have the wet dog smell defect.

First, Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them are expected to explode. 

To find 1% of 50,000 candles:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles also have the wet dog smell defect.

To find 5% of the 500 exploding candles:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25 \text{ candles} \]

So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ 25 \]

"To find out how much Misha will pay for the blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount for one blouse.
2. Subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price for one blouse.
3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses Misha picks out.

First, let's find the discount amount for one blouse:
The regular price of one blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount amount for one blouse is $6.

Next, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price for one blouse:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, we multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses Misha picks out:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
   - From the average trees: Let's call this number \( x \).

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 \)

4. **Combined total:**
   - \( (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500 \)
   - Simplify the equation: \( 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \)
   - Combine like terms: \( 150 + x = 500 \)
   - Solve for \( x \): \( x = 500 - 150 \)
   - \( x = 350 \)

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations. We know two things:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we can write two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To find out how many kilometers Tom traveled in total during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into parts and add up the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total for 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \)
   - Total for 2 days: \( 240 \text{ km} \)

3. **Next 1 day**: He didn't travel at all.
   - Total for 1 day: \( 0 \text{ km} \)

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total for 7 days: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, we add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's and Zack's lockers.

1. We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, to find Zack's locker size, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, to find Timothy's locker size, we multiply Zack's locker size by 2:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away by the boats from the original number of cats on the rock:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we calculate:

3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"To find out how much 2 years of the service cost Bill, we need to break down the costs by the different rates and the time periods they apply to.

1. For the first 6 months, the rate is $8 a month.
   - 6 months * $8/month = $48

2. For the next 8 months, the rate is $12 a month.
   - 8 months * $12/month = $96

3. After the first 14 months, the rate is $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, we need to calculate the cost for the remaining 10 months (24 months - 14 months).
   - 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs:
- $48 + $96 + $140 = $284

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less, so:

Jogger jeans cost = $28 - $6 = $22

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, so:

Savings from jogger jeans = 1/3 * $6 = $2

The rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans, so:

Savings from tattered jeans = $6 - $2 = $4

Now, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to add the savings back to the sale prices. 

Original price of tattered jeans = $28 + $4 = $32
Original price of jogger jeans = $22 + $2 = $24

The difference in original cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

$24 - $32 = -$8

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which implies a positive value, but since the tattered jeans actually cost more originally, the correct interpretation is how much less the jogger jeans cost:

$32 - $24 = $8

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles combined.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- There are 4 buses.
- So, the total capacity of the buses is \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees.

Next, let's calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- There are 6 minibusses.
- So, the total capacity of the minibusses is \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees.

Then, let's calculate the capacity of the minivans:
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- There are 10 minivans.
- So, the total capacity of the minivans is \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
- Total capacity = capacity of buses + capacity of minibusses + capacity of minivans
- Total capacity = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

"To find out how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately, and then add them together.

1. **Homemade Feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 20 birds + 10 more birds = 30 birds.
   - Total birds attracted by homemade feeders = 3 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 90 birds.

2. **Store-Bought Feeders:**
   - Lillian buys 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders = 3 feeders * 20 birds per feeder = 60 birds.

3. **Total Birds:**
   - Total birds attracted by all feeders = 90 birds (homemade) + 60 birds (store-bought) = 150 birds.

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

1. The bagel costs $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4.
   - 25% of $4 is \(0.25 \times 4 = 1\).
   - So, the soup costs \(4 + 1 = 5\) dollars.
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \(4 \div 2 = 2\) dollars.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how many cards he sold and how many he kept. 

First, we know that Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he made a total of $150 from selling his cards.

Since each card is sold for $1.5, we can find out how many cards he sold by dividing the total money he made by the price per card:
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards. If 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection, we can find the total number of cards by:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \frac{100}{2/3} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"First, let's figure out how many hot dogs the caterer prepared. The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests, with enough for half of them to have two hot dogs. 

Half of 36 guests is 18 guests. So, 18 guests would have 2 hot dogs each, and the other 18 guests would have 1 hot dog each.

The total number of hot dogs prepared is:
18 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest + 18 guests * 1 hot dog/guest = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hot dog. This means each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs.

The total number of hot dogs needed for 40 guests is:
40 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 80 hot dogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs, we need to find out how many guests did not get a second hot dog. 

Each guest gets 1 hot dog, so 40 hot dogs are used up for the first round. This leaves:
54 hot dogs - 40 hot dogs = 14 hot dogs for the second round.

Since 40 guests wanted a second hot dog and only 14 were available, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
40 guests - 14 guests = 26 guests.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Adding 4 more letters to this, we get 3 + 4 = 7 letters in her sister's name.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the letters in Indras' name to the letters in her sister's name: 6 + 7 = 13.

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"First, let's find out how much Charlotte's items cost before the discount.

The pot and pans set costs $120.00.
The mixing bowls set costs $20.00.
Each utensil costs $5.00, and she wants 5 of them, so that's 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add all these costs together to find the total before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

The store is offering a 20% discount on everything. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order costs $132.00 after the discount.

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know he bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and she cuts it into 8 pieces. Each piece would weigh 20 ounces divided by 8 pieces, which is 2.5 ounces per piece. If Rory and her mom each have a piece, that's 2 pieces in total, so 2 pieces times 2.5 ounces per piece equals 5 ounces. The original cake was 20 ounces, so if 5 ounces are eaten, the remaining cake weighs 20 ounces minus 5 ounces, which is 15 ounces.

15 ounces"
"First, let's find out how many oranges Sitti and Juris have in total.

Sitti bought 34 oranges.
Juris bought 22 oranges.

So, the total number of oranges is:
34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Now, they want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. This means there are 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people in total.

To find out how many oranges each person gets, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:
56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges per person.

"First, let's figure out how many pounds of onions Antoine will use. The recipe calls for 2 pounds, but he likes to double that amount, so he will use:
2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, the cost will be:
4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

Next, he needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:
$8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:
$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

"First, let's figure out how long it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes and Bernadette's drive is four times as long, we multiply Wayne's time by 4:

4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes, he will arrive 4 minutes after he leaves. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 + 4 = 9 minutes before Wayne leaves.

Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before she wants to arrive. To arrive 9 minutes before Wayne leaves, she needs to leave 16 + 9 = 25 minutes before Wayne leaves.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so if the length is 3 yards, it is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by dividing the area by the length:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find the perimeter of the rectangle, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's figure out how many beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack has 20 beads, so:
- Red beads: 1 pack × 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs × 20 beads/pack = 40 beads

Total beads Elizabeth bought:
20 beads (red) + 40 beads (clear) = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack has 20 beads, so:
- Blue beads: 3 packs × 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs × 20 beads/pack = 80 beads

Total beads Margareth bought:
60 beads (blue) + 80 beads (red) = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

"First, let's figure out how much the temperature increases while Marcus is baking. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the temperature goes up by 5 degrees.

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

So, the temperature after baking is:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, in 30 minutes, the house will cool down:

30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

So, the temperature after opening the window is:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"First, let's figure out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes)
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]
- James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, James's bike time is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the time James took to run as \( R \).

James's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + R \]

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

"First, let's figure out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour.

30 minutes is half an hour, so:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, so:
\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has:
\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 \, \text{dollars} = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost from the total money:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

"First, let's figure out how many eggs Rozanne has in total. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 extra eggs. 

1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs
4 dozen eggs = 4 × 12 = 48 eggs

So, the total number of eggs is:
48 eggs + 2 eggs = 50 eggs

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass needs 5 eggs.

Number of glasses = Total eggs ÷ Eggs per glass
Number of glasses = 50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. So, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

Number of trays = Number of glasses ÷ Glasses per tray
Number of trays = 10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays

"First, let's figure out how much the salesman paid for each sneaker. He bought 48 sneakers for $576, so we divide 576 by 48 to find the cost per sneaker:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the sneakers:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 48 \times 12 = 576 \]

Now, let's find out how much he made from selling the sneakers. He sold 17 sneakers at $20 each:
\[ \text{Money from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

He had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, which he sold to the department store for $25 each:
\[ \text{Money from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Adding the money from both sales gives us the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the two totals together:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. The cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12.
2. The cost of the soda is $3.
3. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

If you bought the super ticket, it would cost you $20, and you would get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, making it $21 in total.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket must be $2 less than $21, which is $19.

So, the equation for the total cost without the super ticket is:
\[ 12 + \text{popcorn price} + 3 = 19 \]

Now, solve for the popcorn price:
\[ 12 + \text{popcorn price} + 3 = 19 \]
\[ 15 + \text{popcorn price} = 19 \]
\[ \text{popcorn price} = 19 - 15 \]
\[ \text{popcorn price} = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"First, let's find out how much it cost to fill one helium balloon before the price increase. If 20 balloons cost $900, then each balloon cost:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

After the price increase, the cost of each balloon went up by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, if Bentley fills 170 balloons at the new price, the total cost would be:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance is 60 * 2 = 120 miles.
- For the second part, the car drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

Now, add the distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

Next, add the times to get the total time:
- Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Finally, calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

Next, we need to find out how many rubies she gets. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she now has 2 rubies.

Now, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Each sapphire is worth $800, so 5 sapphires are worth:

5 * $800 = $4000

Then, we calculate the value of the rubies. Each ruby is worth $1200, so 2 rubies are worth:

"First, we need to find out how much soil Bob needs in total. We do this by calculating the volume of one raised bed and then multiplying it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so:
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{\text{Total Volume}}{\text{Volume per Bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the potting soil. Each bag costs $12, so:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Bags} \times \text{Cost per Bag} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total number of green cards is:
15 red cards + 9 more green cards = 24 green cards.

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

15 red cards + 24 green cards = 39 yellow cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add up the red, green, and yellow cards:

3. **Hay**: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights:
2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- So, the weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

Next, let's calculate the weekly earnings from the plastic bottles:
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, the weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Now, let's add the weekly earnings from both the cans and bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

Finally, to find the earnings for a four-week month:
- Monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 1000 cents

Converting to dollars:
1000 cents / 100 = $10.00

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is:
10% of $10.00 = 0.10 * $10.00 = $1.00

Kelly's final cost after the discount is:

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, we can set up an equation based on what his dad said. 

His dad said Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. So, if we let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks, then the number of cookies Matt can have is \( \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \).

We know Matt wants 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}c + 2 = 5 \]

First, subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ \frac{1}{2}c = 3 \]

Next, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

"First, we need to find the total length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so:

6 inches/remora × 2 remoras = 12 inches

Next, we need to convert the shark's length from feet to inches because the remoras' length is in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras take up. We do this by dividing the total length of the remoras by the length of the shark and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

(12 inches / 120 inches) × 100 = 10%

10%"
"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step.

1. We know that three-fourths (3/4) of the students have a desktop computer at home.
2. This means that one-fourth (1/4) of the students do not have a desktop computer at home.
3. We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This represents the one-fourth (1/4) of the total number of students.

To find the total number of students, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20 \]

To solve for the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 80 \]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To solve this, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts:

9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, this count includes the 3 kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice, so we need to subtract these 3 kids once:

15 - 3 = 12

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids not allergic to anything is:

32 - 12 = 20

"First, let's figure out the cost of the plane tickets. Since there are two people, and each ticket costs $5000, the total for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. The normal price is $1500 per day, and they are staying for 3 days, so the normal cost would be:
\[ 1500 \times 3 = 4500 \]

Since the hotel is 20% more expensive, we need to find 20% of $4500 and add it to the normal cost:
\[ 4500 \times 0.20 = 900 \]
\[ 4500 + 900 = 5400 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.

The weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains. So, the weight of the 2010 penny is:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to get the combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse eats 5 pounds x 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.
3. Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so all the horses together eat 10 pounds x 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.
4. Over 5 days, the horses will eat 40 pounds x 5 = 200 pounds of oats.
5. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so Uncle Ben needs 200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags of oats.

"First, let's figure out how much Heather will pay for 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

1. The razors are on sale for buy one get one free. So, if she buys 1 pack, she gets another pack for free. This means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
2. The price of 1 pack is $4.00.
3. She has a $2.00 coupon, which she can use on the total price of the 2 packs.

So, the total cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (price of 1 pack) - $2.00 (coupon) = $2.00.

Now, let's find out how much each individual razor costs. Each pack has 4 razors, so 2 packs have 8 razors.

The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00. To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:

$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:

$0.25 = 25 cents.

"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let's call the number of guests \( x \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food is $5 per person, so for \( x \) guests, it would be \( 5x \).
- The total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per person, so for \( x \) guests, it would be \( 25x \).
- The total cost for the second venue is \( 25x \).

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests where the costs are the same:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's use some variables to make it easier:
- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
- David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

Now, we know the total number of insects they found together is 43. So we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Now, we can find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we first need to add the fractions of the skein they each used:

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

Adding these fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to find out how many yards \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"First, let's figure out how much Janet spends on bus trips each week without a pass.

She takes 2 bus trips each day, and she does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is:
2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips is:
10 trips * $2.20/trip = $22.00

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would only pay $20 for the week.

To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from what she would normally pay:
$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

\[ 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she had left after buying clothes:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. 

25% of $400 is:
\[ 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she had left after buying the CDs:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Julie had $300 left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \).
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).
3. The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   L + 3L = 120,000
   \]
4. Combine like terms:
   \[
   4L = 120,000
   \]
5. To find the cost of the lot, divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
   \]
6. Now, the cost of the house is three times the cost of the lot:
   \[
   3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
   \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

90,000"
"First, let's figure out how many canvas bags Tara bought. She bought 8 packs, and each pack has 5 bags. So, the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on these bags. Each pack costs $4, and she bought 8 packs, so:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate how much she earned from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, and she had 40 bags, so:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tara's profit is:

"To find out how many punches Joe throws in a fight, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes in the fight.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches Joe throws per minute.

First, we know each round is 3 minutes and there are 5 rounds:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes per round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know Joe throws 25 punches per minute:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes} \times 25 \text{ punches per minute} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

So, Joe throws 375 punches in the fight.

"First, we need to find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made by dividing 36 by 4.

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, Josh made 9 cookies.

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 × 2 = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

18"
"First, let's find out how much money Ali has in total.

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40
- Six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120

So, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to her sister:
- Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80

This means Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining $80 to buy dinner:
- 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48

So, after buying dinner, Ali has $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we first calculate the total number of skeins required for one grandchild and then multiply that by 3 because she has 3 grandchildren.

- For a hat: 2 skeins
- For a scarf: 4 skeins
- For a sweater: 12 skeins
- For a pair of mittens: 1 skein
- For a pair of socks: 2 skeins

Now, let's add these up for one grandchild:
2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins

Since she has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the total for one by 3:
21 skeins × 3 = 63 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, the remaining problems are:
   100 - 12 = 88 problems.
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Since he did 12 problems on Monday, on Tuesday he completes:
   3 * 12 = 36 problems.
   So, the remaining problems after Tuesday are:
   88 - 36 = 52 problems.
4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. One-quarter of 52 is:
   52 / 4 = 13 problems.
   So, the remaining problems after Wednesday are:
   52 - 13 = 39 problems.

Therefore, Chris has 39 problems left to complete on Thursday.

"Let's figure this out step by step:

1. **Tony's picking rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby's picking rate**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's picking rate**: Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's picking rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the total quarts picked per hour by all four:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery had left, we need to start with the total number of loaves baked and then subtract the number of loaves sold and add back any returned loaves.

1. Total loaves baked: 200
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93
3. Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
4. Loaves returned: 6

First, we calculate the total number of loaves sold:
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Next, we subtract the total loaves sold from the total loaves baked:
200 (baked) - 132 (sold) = 68 loaves remaining

Finally, we add the returned loaves to the remaining loaves:
68 (remaining) + 6 (returned) = 74 loaves

So, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left.

74"
"To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the number of rows for the blue tulips separately, and then add them together.

First, let's figure out the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in one row.
- To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row: \( 36 \div 6 = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's figure out the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in one row.
- To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row: \( 24 \div 8 = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips:
- Rows of red tulips: 6
- Rows of blue tulips: 3
- Total rows: \( 6 + 3 = 9 \)

So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

"First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins Heather will use for the oatmeal cookies. Since she divides the 27 cups of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide 27 by 3:

27 ÷ 3 = 9 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies.

Next, we need to figure out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins, so we divide 9 by 3/4:

9 ÷ (3/4) = 9 × (4/3) = 36/3 = 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"First, let's figure out how much Ada's electric bill is before adding the new device.

Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. To find out her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 84 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of this weekly consumption. Since 1 kilowatt per hour costs $1.50:
\[ 84 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126 \, \text{per week} \]

Now, let's calculate the new weekly consumption after adding the device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour a day:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} + 2 \, \text{kWh/day} = 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

The new weekly consumption is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 98 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

The cost of the new weekly consumption is:
\[ 98 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$147 \, \text{per week} \]

Finally, we find the difference between the new weekly bill and the old weekly bill:
\[ \$147 - \$126 = \$21 \]

So, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's figure out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, we need to convert this into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

This means one person would take 240 hours to paint a whole house.

If 5 people are working together, they can divide the work. So, the total time in hours would be:
240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so if she has 20 sofas, she must have 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.
5. Now, we add up all the sofas and chairs:
   - Ophelia's sofas and chairs: 20 sofas + 22 chairs = 42
   - Jenna's sofas and chairs: 64 sofas + 66 chairs = 130
6. The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we first need to figure out how much the headphone set cost. 

1. We know Tom paid $48 in total.
2. He bought a CD for $4.
3. So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $44 left. 

4. Each CD costs $4.
5. To find out how many more CDs he could buy with $44, we divide $44 by $4.

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

"To find out the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to add up the hours he spent each week. Normally, he worked out for 4 hours a week. However, there were a few weeks where he worked out more.

1. For 5 of the weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Now, we add all these hours together:
\[20 + 10 + 6 = 36\]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is 36.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. So, one-third of 21 is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"First, let's figure out how old Jame is right now. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, that means he is currently:

27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Now, let's figure out how old Jame will be in 8 years:

22 + 8 = 30 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55:

55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Now we know that Jame is currently 22 years old and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The difference in their ages is:

47 - 22 = 25 years.

"First, let's figure out how much the printer cost. Since the printer was $400 less than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:
\[ 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up an equation to find the cost of the monitors. Let's call the cost of one monitor \( M \).

The total cost is:
\[ 1100 + 700 + 2M = 2400 \]

Now, we solve for \( M \):
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, one monitor costs $300.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This means each girl brought \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \) seashells.
   - First, calculate \( 4 \times 60 \):
     \[
     4 \times 60 = 240
     \]
   - Then, add this to the 60 seashells:

- 15 vlogs in the third week

Adding these together:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs in a month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

"To figure out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to understand the total number of days in April and then split it into two halves.

April has 30 days, so the first half is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days.

Let's say Elvis saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half of April. In the second half, he wants to save twice as much each day, so he will save \( 2x \) dollars each day.

The total savings for the first half of April will be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of April will be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total savings for the entire month of April will be:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
$30 - $3 = $27

So, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the hamburgers:
5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20

Next, the total cost of the potato fries:
10 packs * $0.30 each = $3

Then, the total cost of the fruit drinks:
5 cans * $2 each = $10

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$20 (hamburgers) + $3 (fries) + $10 (drinks) = $33

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she gets back is:
$50 - $33 = $17

"To find out how much Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
   $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300

2. For the sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
   $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

3. To find the total commission, we add the two amounts together:
   $300 + $150 = $450

So, Antonella earned $450 in commission.

"First, let's figure out how many bottles of water Bill already has. He has 2 cases, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has:
2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Next, let's calculate how many bottles of water he needs for his 70 guests, with 2 bottles per guest:
70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles he needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number he needs:
140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

"First, let's figure out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. 

Twice as long as 16 minutes is 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes more gives us 34 minutes for a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

- In cold water: 16 minutes per mile × 3 miles = 48 minutes
- In warm water: 34 minutes per mile × 3 miles = 102 minutes

To find out how much longer it takes in warm water, we subtract the time in cold water from the time in warm water:

102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes

"First, let's figure out how much John earns in a week.

John works 5 hours a day and gets paid $2 per hour. So, in one day, he earns:
5 hours/day * $2/hour = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save this amount, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"To find out how much it costs for lunch today at Subway, we need to calculate the total cost of both subs.

1. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.
2. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120
   \]
3. Now, we add the cost of both subs to get the total cost:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to break it down into two parts: the holes from the buttons with two holes and the holes from the buttons with four holes.

1. First, we know there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
   \[
   21 \text{ buttons} - 7 \text{ buttons} = 14 \text{ buttons}
   \]
   Each of these 14 buttons has 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
   \[
   14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
   \[
   14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes}
   \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"First, we need to find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it like this:

Zack's locker = 1/2 * Timothy's locker
Zack's locker = 1/2 * 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker = 12 cubic inches

Next, we need to find out how big Peter's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can calculate it like this:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
Peter's locker = 1/4 * 12 cubic inches
Peter's locker = 3 cubic inches

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

"First, let's figure out how much coffee Octavia drinks. The daily recommended amount is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of that. So, Octavia drinks:

4 cups / 2 = 2 cups

Now, Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks:

2 cups * 10 = 20 cups

Juan's doctor wants him to drink the daily recommended amount, which is 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from what he currently drinks:

20 cups - 4 cups = 16 cups

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to add up the number of hamsters and the number of guinea pigs.

First, we calculate the total number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages of hamsters.
- Each cage has 10 hamsters.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages of guinea pigs.
- Each cage has 5 guinea pigs.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total rodents = Total hamsters + Total guinea pigs
- Total rodents = 30 + 15 = 45

So, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total.

"First, let's figure out how much Susan weighs. If Mark weighs 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, then:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, let's find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:

Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, we need to find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:

Average weight = Total weight / 3
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

"To solve this, we need to add the angle the sun moves to the angle of the pyramid from the ground.

1. The angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours, so the total movement of the sun is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees.
3. Adding the angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun has moved gives us \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

"First, we need to figure out the ages of James's two sons. We know one son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. So, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find out how many candles James needs in total. So, 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, and he needs 20 candles. So, 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs of candles.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, and James needs 4 packs. So, 4 × 3 = $12.

"First, let's figure out how many minutes Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, so:

15 minutes/night × 7 nights = 105 minutes

Next, we need to find out how many pages Judy read in the first week. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, so we can find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute:

2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.333 pages/minute

Now, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week:

105 minutes × 1.333 pages/minute = 140 pages

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. So, to find out the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from the first week to the pages from the second week:

140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Shiloh is 44 years old today.
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
3. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

Let's call the nephew's age today \( x \).

In 7 years, the nephew will be \( x + 7 \) years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times the nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 51 = 3 \times (x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the nephew is 10 years old today.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the money the tooth fairy left Sharon:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Mitchell made $84.

Liam made $63.

To find out how much more Mitchell made, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

"First, let's figure out how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we divide $70 by 7:

$70 ÷ 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures that cost $5 each. So, each day he buys:

$10 ÷ $5 = 2 wooden action figures

Since he does this for 4 days, the total number of wooden action figures he buys is:

2 wooden action figures/day × 4 days = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he spends $10 each day on plastic action figures that cost $2 each. So, each day he buys:

$10 ÷ $2 = 5 plastic action figures

Since he does this for 3 days, the total number of plastic action figures he buys is:

5 plastic action figures/day × 3 days = 15 plastic action figures

Now, we add the total number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures he has by the end of the week:

8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

"To find out how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to add up all the expenses. 

First, the cost of spaying the kitten is $200.

Next, the cost of the 3 vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, so for 3 vaccines, it would be:
3 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $60

Then, the cost of the 4 broken vases. Each vase costs $12, so for 4 vases, it would be:
4 vases * $12/vase = $48

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Find the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month. Since there are about 4 weeks in a month and Ford grows 40 roses each week:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second shop orders 15 roses, and the third shop orders 30 roses each week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Now, for a month (4 weeks), the total number of roses ordered is:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, to find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To solve this, we need to figure out how much money Katina takes out in 2 years and then subtract that from her starting amount.

1. First, we know Katina starts with $3000.
2. She takes out $100 every month.
3. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 months.
4. If she takes out $100 each month, in 24 months she will take out 24 * $100 = $2400.
5. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount taken out from the starting amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account.

"First, let's figure out by what percentage the oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it actually reaches 468 degrees. 

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature.

Now, we need to find out what temperature Maggie should set the oven to if she wants it to actually reach 520 degrees. We need to find a temperature \( x \) such that when it's 4% hotter, it reaches 520 degrees.

We can set up the equation:
\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees.

   - \( B = 1500 \).

5. **Calculate the Number of Red and Green Jelly Beans:**
   - Red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
   - Green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

6. **Find the Difference Between Green and Red Jelly Beans:**
   - Difference: \( 1515 - 1485 = 30 \).

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the average of Jared's three typing speed measurements, we first need to add up all the measurements and then divide by the number of measurements.

1. The first measurement is 47 WPM.
2. The second measurement is 52 WPM.
3. The third measurement, after increasing by another 5 WPM, is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add these measurements together:
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Next, we divide the total by the number of measurements, which is 3:
156 ÷ 3 = 52

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

"To find out the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Weight loss with Cheerios:**
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \( 1.25 \times 5 = 6.25 \) pounds.

2. **Weight gain with donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \( 1.75 \times 5 = 8.75 \) pounds.

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - The difference in weight between the two options is the sum of the weight loss and the weight gain.
   - \( 6.25 + 8.75 = 15 \) pounds.

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

"First, let's figure out how many people Alex is directly inviting. She invites 100 people via email and 10 more by phone, so that's 100 + 10 = 110 people.

Next, each of the 100 people invited by email will bring 2 friends. So, 100 people * 2 friends each = 200 friends.

Now, 8 of the 10 friends she called will bring their spouses. So, 8 people * 1 spouse each = 8 spouses.

Adding all these together:
- 110 people directly invited
- 200 friends of the email invitees
- 8 spouses of the phone invitees

110 + 200 + 8 = 318

So, Alex will need 318 seats.

"Let's figure this out step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
   \[
   10 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
   \[
   20 \text{ pounds} \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds} \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds}

The Mastiff weighs 220 pounds."
"First, let's figure out the total cost of the boots on Amazon. The boots cost $16 and the shipping is $4, so:

\[ 16 + 4 = 20 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost on eBay. The boots cost $13, and the shipping is twice as much as on Amazon. Since shipping on Amazon is $4, shipping on eBay is:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

So, the total cost on eBay is:

\[ 13 + 8 = 21 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon. We subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:

\[ 21 - 20 = 1 \]

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"To solve this, we need to figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, starting from 4 feet and doubling in height each day.

Let's list the height of the beanstalk each day:
- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

So, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's current age is \( J \).
2. Five years ago, Jerry's age was \( J - 5 \).
3. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   J = 2 \times (J - 5)
   \]
4. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[
   J = 2J - 10
   \]
   \[
   J - 2J = -10
   \]
   \[
   -J = -10
   \]
   \[
   J = 10

"First, let's figure out the total cost of the dental work. 

- The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so that's $2000 * 2 = $4000.
- One of the implants needs a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.

So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

George earns $15 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide $3900 by $15.

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

"Let's call the smallest angle \( x \). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \), so:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The measure of the largest angle is 90 degrees.

"First, let's figure out how much money Colby has in total.

- Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add all the money together:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents ÷ 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to consider how many legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each type of animal.

- Dogs have 4 legs. There are 5 dogs, so 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs.
- Cats have 4 legs. There are 2 cats, so 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs.
- Birds have 2 legs. There are 10 birds, so 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs.

Now, we add all the legs together: 20 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from cats) + 20 legs (from birds) = 48 legs.

"First, let's figure out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, let's find out how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

120 pounds * 3/4 = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we need to find out how many pounds each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds

For Marissa:

90 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

"First, let's calculate how much money Patrick made in the first four hours. He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup.

15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50 per hour

Since he worked for 4 hours:
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.00

Next, let's calculate how much money he made in the last two hours. He sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.

10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00 per hour

Since he worked for 2 hours:
$6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.00

Now, let's add the money he made in the first four hours to the money he made in the last two hours to find the total amount he earned.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in one month.
2. Determine how many months the tires will last based on the total number of rotations they can handle.
3. Convert the number of months into years.

First, let's find out how many rotations the tires make in one month:
- Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
- Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.

So, for 400 miles:
\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = \left(\frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}}\right) \times 725 \text{ rotations} \]
\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 200 \times 725 \]
\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 145,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how many months the tires will last:
- Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

So, the number of months the tires will last:
\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations/month}} \]
\[ \text{Number of months} = 72 \]

Finally, we convert the number of months into years:
\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months/year}} \]
\[ \text{Number of years} = 6 \]

So, the tires will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"If the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and gives 120 washings using 2 pumps per wash, then using 1 pump per wash would double the number of washings to 240. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of washings when using 1 pump per wash.

Total cost: $24.00
Number of washings with 1 pump: 240

Cost per pump = Total cost / Number of washings
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240
Cost per pump = $0.10

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, $0.10 is equal to 10 cents.

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost to repave each street.

For Monica's street:
- The street is 150 meters long.
- It costs $194 per meter to repave.
- So, the cost to repave Monica's street is \( 150 \times 194 \).

For Lewis' street:
- The street is 490 meters long.
- It costs $194 per meter to repave.
- So, the cost to repave Lewis' street is \( 490 \times 194 \).

Now, let's calculate these costs:
- Cost to repave Monica's street: \( 150 \times 194 = 29100 \) dollars.
- Cost to repave Lewis' street: \( 490 \times 194 = 95060 \) dollars.

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Funding: $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for additional months: 50% more than the initial monthly funding
   - Initial monthly funding: $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month
   - Additional monthly funding: $20,000 + (0.5 * $20,000) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000 per month
   - Total funding for additional months: 45 months * $30,000 per month = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Initial 5 months: $100,000
   - Additional 45 months: $1,350,000

"To find out how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team, we need to add up the amounts of meat each player who ate meat consumed.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

"First, let's figure out how much each coach spent.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, the total cost for the baseballs is:
9 * $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, the total cost for the basketballs is:
8 * $14 = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the total cost of the baseballs from the total cost of the basketballs:
$112 - $27 = $85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

"First, we need to find out how many flowers Arianna planted in total. She has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that only 4/5 of these flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, let's convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download 20 kb/second * 3600 seconds = 72,000 kb.

Next, let's convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:
- Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb.
- 72,000 kb / 1000 = 72 Mb.

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - So, for three days: \( 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \).

2. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - So, for each of these days: \( 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \).
   - For four days: \( 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Total cars towed = Cars towed in the first three days + Cars towed in the remaining four days
   - Total cars towed = \( 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \).

So, the total number of cars towed that week is 54.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to know how tall he needs to be in inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, 4 feet is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and needs to be 48 inches tall, so he needs to grow:

48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Adam grows 2 inches every year, so to grow 8 inches, it will take:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost the company paid to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Total Sales Amount:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   \[
   25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \text{ per car}
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   The profit is the total sales amount minus the acquisition cost.
   \[
   250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

So, James made:
\[
17,500

"First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate 25% of 100 riders:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders who stay upright are women. So, we calculate 60% of 25:

60% of 25 = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women

Since the total number of riders who stay upright is 25, and 15 of them are women, the number of men who stay upright is:

25 - 15 = 10 men

"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. Since the diamond jewel costs $2000, we calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel:

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels to find the total price:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To find out how many stamps Max bought in all, let's break down the information step by step.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we add up all the stamps:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find out how much faster Tom is going compared to Bob and then see how long it will take for Tom to cover the 75 miles gap.

Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is catching up to Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the rate:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To figure out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to first understand how much each class costs if he attends all of them. The total cost is $60 for 10 classes, so each class costs $60 divided by 10, which is $6 per class.

Manny's parents will only continue if the cost per class is $10 or less. If Manny misses a class, the cost per class for the ones he does attend goes up. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class he attends hits $10.

Let's say Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he attends \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class he attends would then be \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We set this equal to $10 to find the maximum number of classes he can miss:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} = 10
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
60 = 10(10 - x)
\]

\[
60 = 100 - 10x
\]

\[
10x = 40
\]

\[
x = 4
\]

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

1. **Determine Jewel's daily production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers each day.

2. **Determine Julie's daily production:**
   - Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) customers each day.

3. **Calculate the total daily production for both Julie and Jewel:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers.
   - Julie processes 100 customers.
   - Together, they process \( 50 + 100 = 150 \) customers each day.

4. **Calculate the total weekly production:**
   - They work all 7 days of the week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly production is \( 150 \times 7 = 1050 \) customers.

So, the total weekly production for the two is:

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   - \( \frac{7500}{3} = 2500 \)
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   - \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \)

"First, let's figure out Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise. 

His original salary is $20,000 a month. A 5% raise on $20,000 is calculated as:
\[ 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

Next, let's calculate his annual salary without the bonus:
\[ 21,000 \times 12 = 252,000 \]

Now, let's add the bonus. The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:
\[ 21,000 \div 2 = 10,500 \]

So, his total annual income including the bonus is:

   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**

"To find out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through both the soil and the clay.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the clay:

"To find out how much Ariadne made in total over two months, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales over the two months:**
   - Total sales over two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales over two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

"To figure out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves all the guests will eat in total. Since each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests:
   \[
   3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
   \]

2. Next, we need to determine how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves:
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

For the first mixture:
- 1/2 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
- The difference in cost is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

We know two things:
1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads is the sum of the number of sheep and geese:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs is:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep is 15.

"First, let's figure out how much the more expensive brand of coffee costs. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

20% of $5 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and buys a week's worth, which is 7 days. So, he buys:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars worth of coffee} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \]

"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to add up the costs of the items Gus bought and then subtract that total from the $20.00 he spent.

- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- 1 bucket of fried chicken for $8.00: $8.00
- 1 bottle of soda for $1.00: $1.00

Now, add these amounts together:
$4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Gus spent $20.00 in total, so to find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from $20.00:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00.

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C

Let's do the math:

600 - 198 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

"First, let's find out how many history teachers there are. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers.

60% of 150 = 0.60 * 150 = 90 history teachers

Now, to find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

150 - 90 = 60 math teachers

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers spend sleeping in one day is:

60 math teachers * 6 hours/teacher = 360 hours

"First, let's figure out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money like this:

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so:

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, let's add together all their money:

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

If they share the total money equally among the three of them:

Money each = Total money / 3
Money each = 360 / 3
Money each = 120

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

For the candies of type A:
- Adam bought 7 candies.
- Each candy costs $0.5.
- So, the total cost for type A candies is \( 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \) dollars.

For the candies of type B:
- Adam bought 10 candies.
- Each candy costs $0.75.
- So, the total cost for type B candies is \( 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \) dollars.

Now, let's add the costs of both types of candies to find the total amount Adam spent:
- Total cost = \( 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \) dollars.

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
- Change = \( 15 - 11 = 4 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 days

Now, let's look at the distribution of these days:
- **First 8 Days**: All good
- **Next 8 Days**: All bad
- **Next 8 Days**: All neutral
- **Remaining 6 Days**: We need to figure out the distribution of these days.

Since the first 24 days are already accounted for (8 good, 8 bad, 8 neutral), the remaining 6 days must be distributed as follows:
- **Remaining 6 Days**: 12 - 8 = 4 good days, 8 - 8 = 0 bad days, 10 - 8 = 2 neutral days

So, the remaining 6 days are:
- 4 good days
- 2 neutral days

Now, if the next three days are:
- Good
- Neutral
- Good

We need to update the count of good days:
- Initially, there are 4 good days left in the remaining 6 days.
- Adding the next three days: 1 good, 1 neutral, 1 good.

So, the total number of good days left in the month is:
4 (initial good days) + 2 (next three days) = 6 good days

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say the number of books Sally has is \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

Now, we solve for \( S \):
1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
\[ 9 = S \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"First, let's figure out how tall the bamboo is in inches right now. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, if the bamboo is 20 feet tall, we multiply 20 by 12 to get the height in inches.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

The bamboo is currently 240 inches tall. We want to know when it will be 600 inches tall. To find out how much more it needs to grow, we subtract the current height from the target height.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo needs to grow 360 more inches. We know it grows 30 inches a day, so we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so he needs 8 more toys. Now he has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
3. When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. He left with 12 dogs (4 original + 8 new), so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
4. He needs 24 toys now, but he already has 12, so he buys 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
5. When he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. He had 24 toys, so now he needs 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. The final length of the dress is 140 cm, which includes the 20 cm of lace trim added to the bottom. 

First, subtract the 20 cm of lace trim from the final length:
140 cm - 20 cm = 120 cm

This 120 cm is the length of the dress after it was extended by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length of the dress \( x \).

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is:
\[ x + 0.5x = 1.5x \]

We know that this new length is 120 cm:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Let's call the age of one of the triplets \( T \) and the age of one of the twins \( W \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write that as:

\[ W = T + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2W + 3T = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(T + 7) + 3T = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( T \):

\[ 2T + 14 + 3T = 44 \]
\[ 5T + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5T = 30 \]
\[ T = 6 \]

"First, let's find out how much the candies cost. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so five lollipops cost:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, we can find out how much the four candies cost by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:

$3.20 total - $2.00 for lollipops = $1.20 for four candies

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now we know the cost of one lollipop and one candy, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives us the total cost:

$4.00 for lollipops + $3.00 for candies = $7.00

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

"First, let's figure out how many coins Neil saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, which means:

Neil's monthly savings = Rong's monthly savings + (2/5 * Rong's monthly savings)
Neil's monthly savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's monthly savings = 20 + 8
Neil's monthly savings = 28 coins

Now, let's calculate how many coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong's total savings in 10 years = 20 coins/month * 120 months
Rong's total savings in 10 years = 2400 coins

Neil's total savings in 10 years = 28 coins/month * 120 months
Neil's total savings in 10 years = 3360 coins

Now, let's add their savings together to find the total number of coins they have after 10 years.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we know the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill \( T \). The cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

Now, we add the costs of all the fruits together:
- Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is \$32.0.

"First, let's figure out how many chairs are needed for the adults and babies.

There are 42 adults, so we need 42 regular chairs for them. There are 15 babies, so we need 15 high chairs for them.

The restaurant already has 8 high chairs, but we need 15 high chairs in total. So, we need 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

Now, let's check how many regular chairs the restaurant has. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, the restaurant has 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

We need 42 regular chairs for the adults, but the restaurant has 40 regular chairs. So, we need 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia’s restaurant needs 7 more high chairs and 2 more regular chairs, which adds up to 7 + 2 = 9 more chairs.

   - So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - So, Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Martha: 105 points

Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing:
400 - 255 = 145 points

"To find out how many great grand-babies Great Grandma Jones will have to kiss, we need to follow the family tree step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own (the grandchildren). So, the number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 children of their own (the great grand-babies). So, the number of great grand-babies is:
   \[
   9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great grand-babies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great grand-babies}
   \]

So, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is:

"First, let's figure out how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

50% of $2400.00 = 0.50 * $2400.00 = $1200.00

Next, let's find out how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment:

20% of $2400.00 = 0.20 * $2400.00 = $480.00

Now, let's add up the total amount she has spent on her retirement and car payment:

$1200.00 (retirement) + $480.00 (car payment) = $1680.00

Finally, to find out how much money she has left to spend, we subtract the total amount spent from her original paycheck:

$2400.00 (original paycheck) - $1680.00 (total spent) = $720.00

$720.00"
"If the box can hold 20 pencils and there are 4 pencils missing, then there are 16 pencils in the box. To find out how many pairs of pencils there are, we divide the number of pencils by 2 because a pair means two pencils.

"First, let's figure out how many fireworks the city will set off. The city has 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Hannah can see 40% of these fireworks, so:
300 fireworks * 40% = 120 fireworks

Next, let's find out how many fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah will see from the city to the fireworks she will set off herself:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

"First, let's figure out how many people are in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so:

13 + 7 = 20 people

Each person saves a seat, and each seat can hold two drinks and three snacks. So, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks is:

Drinks: 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks
Snacks: 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks

Now, we need to find out how much they spend on drinks and snacks. Each drink and snack costs $2, so:

Cost of drinks: 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
Cost of snacks: 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Adding the cost of drinks and snacks together gives us the total amount spent:

$80 + $120 = $200

So, the group has spent $200 on snacks and drinks.

"First, let's figure out how much Gordy's truck can haul. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, and Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's. So, Gordy's truck can haul:

4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds

Now, we know the total amount of gravel the three trucks can haul together is 11,600 pounds. We already know how much Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul, so we can find out how much Gary's truck can haul by subtracting the amounts Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul from the total:

11,600 - 4,000 - 4,800 = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to figure out how many dumplings each group (males and females) ate in total.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. Since there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
\[ 18 \text{ dumplings (females)} + 32 \text{ dumplings (males)} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:

"First, we need to figure out how much money Gerald and Julia each got from the $100. The ratio is 3:2, which means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

To find out how much one part is, we divide $100 by 5:
\[ 100 \div 5 = 20 \]

So, one part is $20. Now, we can find out how much Gerald got:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Gerald got $60. If he spent $10 on a book, we subtract $10 from $60 to find out how much he has left:
\[ 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, Gerald has $50 left.

"First, we need to find out how fast the turtle can crawl. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we divide the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second, so the turtle's speed is:
15 feet/second ÷ 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this, we need to figure out how much they need to raise in total and how much they are raising per hour.

1. First, we know their goal is $6300.
2. They have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours.
3. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.
4. To find out how much they are raising per hour, we divide the amount raised in the first 3 hours by 3: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.
5. Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide $4200 by $700 per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.
6. Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is 3 + 6 = 9 hours.

"First, let's figure out what percent of the river's water is used by Colorado City for industrial purposes. 

If Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the industrial water use as follows:

40% of the river's water * 80% used for industrial purposes = 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32 or 32% of the river's total water.

Now, to find the percent of the river's water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial use from the total use by the city:

40% (total use by the city) - 32% (industrial use) = 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours for both chocolate and vanilla flavors.

First, let's find out how much chocolate ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- In 48 hours, the factory can make \( \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 24 \) batches of chocolate ice cream.
- Each batch is 100 quarts, so in 48 hours, the factory can make \( 24 \times 100 = 2400 \) quarts of chocolate ice cream.

Next, let's find out how much vanilla ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- In 48 hours, the factory can make \( \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12 \) batches of vanilla ice cream.
- Each batch is 50 quarts, so in 48 hours, the factory can make \( 12 \times 50 = 600 \) quarts of vanilla ice cream.

Now, let's add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours:
- Total quarts of ice cream = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total before the discount:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many pieces of candy each of them eats in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

Now, let's see how much candy they have left after two weeks.

Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 inches, which is 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. We can set up the equation:

\[ 100 = 9 \times \text{(length of Bobby's shoe)} + 10 \]

To find the length of Bobby's shoe, we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9 \times \text{(length of Bobby's shoe)} \]
\[ 90 = 9 \times \text{(length of Bobby's shoe)} \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ \text{length of Bobby's shoe} = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ \text{length of Bobby's shoe} = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\).

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- A quarter of 256 is \(256 \div 4 = 64\).

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\).

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Three-quarters of 64 is \(64 \times \frac{3}{4} = 48\).

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112.

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashed is 112.

Father's age = 38

Now, Dora's mother is four years younger than her father, so:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add up the weight of each book. Let's break it down:

1. Math book: 2 pounds
2. Science book: 2 pounds
3. French book: 4 pounds
4. English book: 3 pounds
5. History book: 2 times the weight of the English book, so 2 * 3 = 6 pounds

Now, we add all these weights together:
2 (Math) + 2 (Science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (History) = 17 pounds

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"First, let's figure out how many votes candidate A got. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we need to find 50% of candidate A's votes and add that to candidate A's total:

50% of 20 = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes

So, candidate B got:

20 votes (A's votes) + 10 votes = 30 votes

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. We can find out how many votes candidate C got by subtracting the votes of A and B from the total:

100 votes (total) - 20 votes (A) - 30 votes (B) = 50 votes

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

"First, let's figure out how many apples Beck has initially. Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. So, Beck has:

100 - 23 = 77 apples

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

100 - 10 = 90 apples

And Beck will have:

77 + 10 = 87 apples

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

90 - 87 = 3

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"First, let's figure out how much water Peter uses for each type of ice cube.

For the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- He makes 3 giant cubes.
- So, 3 giant cubes use 3 * 4 = 12 ounces of water.

For the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- He makes 7 medium cubes.
- So, 7 medium cubes use 7 * 2 = 14 ounces of water.

For the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- He makes 8 small cubes.
- So, 8 small cubes use 8 * 1/2 = 4 ounces of water.

Now, let's add up all the water used:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, the water left is:
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

Next, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. So, Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"First, we need to find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, if we subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar, we get the cost of a half-gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

Total amount spent = Cost of 10 gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount spent = $50 + $48 = $98

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Number of students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Number of students who like to play basketball**: 5

First, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for those who like to bake and play basketball.

\[ 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

So, 35 students like to either play video games or play music.

Next, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

So, 10 students like to play music.

Now, we can find out how many students like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the remaining 35 students:

\[ 35 - 10 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

"To find out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

First, let's figure out the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:
- There are 4 weeks in a month, so in two months, there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weeks.
- Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

So, in 8 weeks:
- The number of weekdays is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) days.
- The number of weekend days is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) days.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- On weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. So, for 40 weekdays, the total is \(60 \times 40 = 2400\) chairs.
- On weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. So, for 16 weekend days, the total is \(100 \times 16 = 1600\) chairs.

Finally, we add the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends to get the total:
- Total chairs rented = \(2400 + 1600 = 4000\)

"To find out how much each roommate, including Jenna, will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the monthly cost per person.
2. Multiply the monthly cost per person by the number of months in a year.

First, the total monthly bill is $100. Since there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates), we divide the total bill by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly cost per person} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the yearly cost per person by multiplying the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Yearly cost per person} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.

"First, let's figure out how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

30 small stickers * 90% = 27 small stickers

Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets:

27 small stickers / 3 small stickers per large button = 9 large buttons

Next, let's see how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

40 large stickers * 50% = 20 large stickers

Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets:

20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

Now, she has 20 large stickers left, which she trades for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so:

20 large stickers * 3 small buttons per large sticker = 60 small buttons

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from the small stickers, 20 large buttons from the large stickers, and 60 small buttons from the remaining large stickers. Since each large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert all her large buttons to small buttons to find the total:

9 large buttons * 3 small buttons per large button = 27 small buttons
20 large buttons * 3 small buttons per large button = 60 small buttons

Total small buttons = 27 small buttons + 60 small buttons + 60 small buttons = 147 small buttons

So, Lorraine has 147 small buttons by the end.

"Let's break this down step by step. If the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against, we can set up an equation to figure out how many votes were in favor and how many were against.

Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is \( x \). Then, the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \) because it's twice as many.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), which is:
\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of medium shirts needed is \( 22 - 4 = 18 \).
4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of large shirts needed is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, the number of extra-large shirts needed is \( 9 + 6 = 15 \).

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:

Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. So, if 18 is two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 of total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can solve for the total by multiplying both sides by 3/2:

Total puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total puppies = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house is \( x \).
2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, so it will need \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
3. The third house needs double what the first house needs, so it will need \( 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x \) cases.

Now, we know the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + x + x = 250
\]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250
\]

To make it easier to solve, multiply every term by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

\[
x + 4x = 500
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x = 500
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{500}{5} = 100
\]

So, the second house needs 100 cases, the first house needs \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) cases, and the third house needs 100 cases.

The third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He already makes $60 from the eggplants, so we need to find out how much more he needs to make from the corn:

$135 total - $60 from eggplants = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he needs to sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the total amount he needs by the number of ears of corn:

$75 / 25 ears of corn = $3 per ear of corn

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"First, let's figure out how much total time Tatiana has over the weekend. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so:

7 + 5 = 12 hours total.

Next, we know she reads for 3 hours. So, we subtract the reading time from the total time:

12 - 3 = 9 hours left for other activities.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. So, we calculate 1/3 of 9 hours:

1/3 * 9 = 3 hours for video games.

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:

9 - 3 = 6 hours playing soccer.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

( Time spent on soccer / Total time available ) * 100

So, we calculate:

( 6 / 12 ) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

50%"
"First, let's figure out how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Anthony had 50 pencils and he gave half of them to Brandon:

50 / 2 = 25 pencils

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. Now, Anthony has:

50 - 25 = 25 pencils left

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils that is, we calculate:

3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. Now, to find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we subtract the pencils he gave to Charlie from the pencils he had left after giving some to Brandon:

25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving and the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum and back. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph.

The time to drive to the museum is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives to the museum and back, the total driving time is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack also spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time he is gone from home is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many wheels will be left, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels Henry needs for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles together:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box:
650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

"To find out how much you have to pay after a 20% discount, first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount: 20% of $1000.
   - 20% = 20/100 = 0.20
   - Discount amount = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price:
   - Price after discount = $1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800.

"First, let's figure out how many movies are in series. Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in series:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ movies in series} \]

The cost for these series movies is $6 each:
\[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many movies are not in series:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies} \]

Out of these 400 movies, 40% are older movies:
\[ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ older movies} \]

The cost for these older movies is $5 each:
\[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining movies are normal movies:
\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \text{ normal movies} \]

The cost for these normal movies is $10 each:
\[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is:
4400"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit he picked and then add those costs together.

1. **Peaches**: Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches at $2.00 per pound.
   - Cost of peaches = 6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00

2. **Plums**: Winston picked 8 pounds of plums at $1.00 per pound.
   - Cost of plums = 8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00

3. **Apricots**: Winston picked 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 per pound.
   - Cost of apricots = 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs of all the fruits together:
- Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
- Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

"To find out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot was, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, and then add these distances together.

First, let's find out how fast they hiked. They hiked at a speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of that speed is 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed was:

25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so the distance they hiked is:

1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles

Now, let's find out how long they drove. They spent a total of 6 hours traveling, and 1.5 hours of that was hiking, so the time spent driving is:

6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours

The distance they drove is the time spent driving multiplied by their driving speed:

4.5 hours * 50 miles per hour = 225 miles

Finally, we add the distance they drove to the distance they hiked to get the total distance to their vacation spot:

225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points they each earn and then subtract Emma's score from Ava's score.

Let's break it down:

1. **Points for enemies:**
   - If Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, then Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points for Emma: \( 10E \)
   - Points for Ava: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)

2. **Points for berries:**
   - If Emma collects \( B \) berries, then Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points for Emma: \( 5B \)
   - Points for Ava: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)

3. **Points for time left:**
   - If Emma finishes the level with \( T \) seconds left, then Ava finishes with \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points for Emma: \( 30T \)
   - Points for Ava: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

Now, let's add up the total points for each:

- **Emma's total score:**
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T
  \]

- **Ava's total score:**
  \[
  10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
  \]
  Simplifying Ava's total score:
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
  \]

Finally, the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
(10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = -25
\]

So, the difference between their scores is:
\[
-25

"First, let's find out how much the two pizzas that we know about cost together. They cost 30 dollars. 

Now, the total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. So, we need to find out how much the other two pizzas cost together. We do this by subtracting the cost of the two pizzas we know about from the total cost:

64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

This means the other two pizzas together cost 34 dollars. Since the question says these two pizzas cost the same amount, we need to divide this cost by 2 to find out how much each one costs:

34 dollars ÷ 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

"First, let's figure out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes on the usual days. They ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, we multiply 3 times by 5 days:

3 times/day × 5 days = 15 times

Next, on the two other days, they ride twice as much as they do on a usual day. Since they usually ride 3 times a day, on these special days, they ride:

2 × 3 times/day = 6 times/day

Now, we need to find out how many times they ride on these two special days:

6 times/day × 2 days = 12 times

Finally, we add the number of times they ride on the usual days and the special days to get the total number of times they ride in a week:

15 times + 12 times = 27 times

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
3. After adding these 17 fish, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's use some variables to help us:
- Let \( x \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.
- Then, the number of orange fish Bob bought is \( 17 - x \).

After buying the fish:
- The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + x \).
- The total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 20 - x = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 20 - x = 8 + 2x \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2x + x \]
\[ 12 = 3x \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to work and back home each day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of workdays in a week to get the total weekly distance.
3. Determine how many gallons of gas Andy uses per week by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency.
4. Calculate the total cost of the gas used per week by multiplying the gallons of gas used per week by the price per gallon.

Let's do the math:

1. One-way distance to work is 5 miles, so round trip (to work and back home) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
2. Andy works 5 days a week, so the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.
3. Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, so the gallons of gas used per week is 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons.
4. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"First, let's figure out how much money Carrie has in total from the twenties and the quarters.

She has ten twenties, so:
10 * $20 = $200

She also has 140 quarters, and since each quarter is worth $0.25, we have:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Now, let's find out how much she spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of the twenties, we calculate:
3/5 * $200 = $120

So, the total amount she spent is the sum of the quarters and the part of the twenties:
$35 + $120 = $155

The total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- So, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we first need to figure out how many smart TVs and analog TVs were sold, and then subtract that from the total number of TVs sold.

1. **Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:**
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40.
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).

2. **Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:**
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \).

3. **Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:**
   - Total TVs sold = 40.
   - Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs = 10 + 5 = 15.
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs) = 40 - 15 = 25.

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. Since \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]
So, 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each person in these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Since each group has 9 people, the total number of seashells brought back by one group is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]
For 6 groups, the total number of seashells is:
\[ 6 \times 18 = 108 \]

\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

For these extra hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. First, we find 150% of $20:

\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

So, for the 3 extra hours, she earns:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months to get the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over three months.**

The total amount paid over three months is:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- So, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- So, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

Let's say Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. After buying the goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. This can be written as:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Then, we calculate the total hours Kris plays in the next week:
- 2 hours every day for 7 days = 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Now, we add the hours from both periods to find the total hours Kris has played:
- Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required:
- Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

   140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"First, we need to find the total cost of the diamond and the gold. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so together they cost:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, James pays a 30% premium on top of this total cost. To find the premium, we calculate 30% of $900:

\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original cost to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the total amount James paid is:

1170"
"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students.

1. **Third-graders:**
   - Number of students who passed: 340
   - Total number of students: 500

2. **Fourth-graders:**
   - Number of students who passed: 40
   - Total number of students: 100

3. **Fifth-graders:**
   - The pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders.
   - Pass rate for fourth-graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%
   - Pass rate for fifth-graders: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%
   - Number of students who passed: \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \)
   - Total number of students: 400

Now, let's add up the totals:

- Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)
- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.7 \]

To express this as a percentage:

\[ 0.7 \times 100 = 70\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"First, let's figure out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since he has two bags and each bag holds 72 chips:

2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch:

144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how long it can be, we divide the total area by the height:

12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"First, let's figure out how much tea was drunk by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, let's add the tea that was drunk to the tea that was left over to find out how much tea there was in total at the beginning of the party.

6 quarts + 32 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can find out how many gallons of tea there were by dividing the total quarts by 4.

48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

"Dale started with 100 candies and sold 150, which means he sold all 100 he had and needed 50 more to fulfill the orders. After selling 150, he ordered 100 more candies. So now, he has 100 candies and has already sold 150. To find out how many more he needs to sell to sell all of his candy, we need to add the 100 new candies to the 50 he was short from the first order, which totals 150 candies he still needs to sell.

150"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the number of students grows each month. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Let's break it down month by month:

1. ** Beginning of the year: ** 10 students
2. ** End of January: ** 10 * 2 = 20 students
3. ** End of February: ** 20 * 2 = 40 students
4. ** End of March: ** 40 * 2 = 80 students
5. ** End of April: ** 80 * 2 = 160 students
6. ** End of May: ** 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, we need to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10
- Number of students at the end of May: 320

The additional students who joined by the end of May are:
320 - 10 = 310

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.
2. Felix made $105 in a week.
3. We need to find out how much he made per day by dividing the total amount by the number of days in a week.
4. Then, we need to find out how many branches he climbed per day by dividing the daily earnings by the cost per branch, which is $0.25.

Let's do the math:

1. Total earnings in a week: $105
2. Number of days in a week: 7
3. Daily earnings: $105 ÷ 7 = $15
4. Cost per branch: $0.25
5. Number of branches climbed per day: $15 ÷ $0.25 = 60

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"First, let's figure out how many petals Rose picked initially:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's add all these petals together to find the total number of petals she picked:

\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals

Next, since she drops 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals from those flowers:

- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

Now, let's add up the petals from the dropped flowers:

\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals

Finally, subtract the petals from the dropped flowers from the total number of petals she picked:

\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"First, let's figure out how many marshmallows they used and lost. John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they used:
9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows

They also dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows not available for S'mores is:
18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left is:
35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows

Since there are 14 marshmallows left and 2 kids, each kid can have:
14 ÷ 2 = 7 S'mores

"First, let's figure out how long each person can play with one quarter.

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter.

Next, let's convert the total playtime from hours to minutes:
- 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate how many quarters each person uses to play for 240 minutes.

- Jack: 
  \[
  \text{Number of quarters} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- Two friends (10 minutes per quarter):
  \[
  \text{Number of quarters} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each}
  \]

- One friend (30 minutes per quarter):
  \[
  \text{Number of quarters} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
  \]

Now, let's add up the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
\[
12 \text{ (Jack)} + 24 \text{ (Friend 1)} + 24 \text{ (Friend 2)} + 8 \text{ (Friend 3)} = 68 \text{ quarters}
\]

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
\[
68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
   - The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

2. **Express All Quantities in Terms of \( z \):**
   - Since \( s = 2z \), the amount of salt is \( 2z \) ounces.
   - The amount of sugar is also \( 2z \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.
   - Therefore, the sum of all the ingredients is:
     \[
     z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     10z = 10
     \]

4. **Solve for \( z \):**
   - Divide both sides by 10:
     \[
     z = 1
     \]

5. **Find the Amount of Oil:**
   - The amount of oil is \( 4z \):
     \[
     4z = 4 \times 1 = 4
     \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- So, the total cost for the goats is 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- So, the total cost for the cows is 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the cows to find the total amount John spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 in total.

"First, let's figure out how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. So, he gives away:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, let's calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised in total. We do this by subtracting the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised for the charity.

Total amount raised: $175,000
Amount raised by organizations: $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we need to find out how much each student raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.

Number of students: 20

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in one day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in one week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in one week.

Step 1: Total tasks per day
John does 30 cycles a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Step 2: Total tasks per week
John works 7 days a week, so the total number of tasks per week is:
\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1050 \text{ tasks/week} \]

Step 3: Total money made per week
Each task pays $1.20, so the total amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[ 1050 \text{ tasks/week} \times 1.20 \text{ dollars/task} = 1260 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"First, let's figure out how many points Julie scored in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, and Sasha scored 14 points, we can calculate Julie's score as follows:

Julie's score in the first game = Sasha's score - 4
Julie's score in the first game = 14 - 4 = 10 points

Next, we need to find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game:

Sasha's score in the second game = Julie's score in the first game - 6
Sasha's score in the second game = 10 - 6 = 4 points

Now, we add up the points Sasha scored in both games to find the total:

Total points Sasha scored = Points in the first game + Points in the second game
Total points Sasha scored = 14 + 4 = 18 points

"Let's use some math to figure this out. We know the total number of cards is 341. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

Now, we can add all these together to get the total number of cards:
\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 7x = 329 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the information:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, if she had 5 green eggs, she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. So, if she had 10 blue eggs, she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, if she had 9 pink eggs, she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

"To figure out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and then subtract the refund she gets from the book's original price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
  \( 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \)
- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
  \( 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \)
- Total shipping cost:

Next, let's calculate the refund Milly will get:
- The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
  \( \$32 \times 0.75 = \$24 \)

Now, let's find out how much money Milly will lose:
- The original cost of the book is $32.
- She gets a refund of $24.
- The shipping cost is $3.00.
- Money lost:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.
2. In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars.
3. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
4. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the chocolate bars produced in the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we need to find out how many bars he produces in the fourth week:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production in the first three weeks) = 14,000 bars.

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom:
\[
x + 150 + 80
\]

This total amount is $50 less than the reduced price of the laptop:
\[
x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
x + 230 = 350
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 350 - 230
\]
\[
x = 120
\]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"First, let's figure out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and he slices 3 large apples, he gets:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices from large apples.

Next, let's figure out how many slices he gets from the small apples. Since a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and he slices 5 small apples, he gets:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices from small apples.

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices in total.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices left.

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to figure out how much milk he is currently producing and then how many cows are needed to reach 25 liters a day.

1. The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. So, the total milk produced by 3 cows is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters a day.
4. The difference between the desired amount and the current amount is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, to produce an additional 10 liters, the farmer needs \(10 \div 5 = 2\) more cows.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate how much of each glue stick is left and then add those amounts together.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we add the lengths of the remaining parts of the glue sticks:
\[
2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm.

16 mm"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first add up the total cost of the car and the phone. The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800, so together they cost:

\[ 10000 + 800 = 10800 \]

Next, we add up the money Gabriel has. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has:

\[ 5000 + 200 = 5200 \]

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 10800 - 5200 = 5600 \]

So, Gabriel still needs $5600. 

5600"

"First, let's figure out how much money Craig starts with. He has 2 twenty dollar bills, so that's:
2 * $20 = $40

Next, let's calculate how much he spends on the squirt guns. He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so that's:
6 * $2 = $12

Now, let's calculate how much he spends on the water balloons. He buys 3 packs for $3 each, so that's:
3 * $3 = $9

Now, let's add up the total amount he spends:
$12 (squirt guns) + $9 (water balloons) = $21

Finally, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount he started with:
$40 - $21 = $19

So, Craig has $19 left.

"First, let's figure out how many socks and dishes Jack has.

Jack has 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find out how many socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2:
\[ \text{Jack's socks} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's find out how many socks and dishes Peter has.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:
\[ \text{Peter's socks} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:
\[ \text{Peter's dishes} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes they have together:
\[ \text{Total socks} = \text{Jack's socks} + \text{Peter's socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = \text{Jack's dishes} + \text{Peter's dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students are good at English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both subjects.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total.

Total students = Students good at math only + Students good at English only + Students good at both
20 = 5 + 8 + Students good at both

Now, solve for the number of students good at both:
20 = 13 + Students good at both
Students good at both = 20 - 13
Students good at both = 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students good at math only and the students good at both:
Students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both
Students good at math = 5 + 7
Students good at math = 12

"First, let's figure out how much time each group needs in total. Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, each group needs:

2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. If there is a 10-minute intermission, the time available for the groups to perform is:

120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, to find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total available time by the time each group needs:

110 / 10 = 11

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original amount.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]

However, the rate should be a fraction of the principal, not a dollar amount. The correct rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) or 0.75.

So, the correct interest calculation is:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 675 \]

Now, add the interest to the original amount to find the total:
\[ \text{Total} = 300 + 675 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have:
\[ 975 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many white shirts have collars and how many don't. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, that means 20 white shirts have collars and 20 white shirts do not have collars.

Next, we know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. Since there are 50 floral shirts in total, the number of floral shirts without buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are compared to white shirts with no collars. We have 30 floral shirts with no buttons and 20 white shirts with no collars.

So, 30 - 20 = 10

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs.
2. Multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings.

Step 1: Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
Number of trays = 900 / 30
Number of trays = 30

Step 2: Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
Total earnings = 30 * $2.5
Total earnings = $75

So, the farmer will earn $75.

55 - 10 = 45 goats

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means:
2 * 10 = 20 goats

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Now, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 + 25 = 70 goats

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, we multiply this by 12 months to find the yearly total:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Next, we divide the total amount spent on shoes by the number of pairs bought:
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

So, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - So, 3 baskets of green food cost 3 * $25 = $75.

2. Next, calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food actually costs $18 - $2 = $16.
   - So, 3 baskets of red food cost 3 * $16 = $48.

3. Finally, add the costs of the green and red food baskets together:
   - Total cost = $75 (green) + $48 (red) = $123.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is $123.

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to figure out how many rooms that is and then calculate the total time needed.

1. First, find out how many rooms are in one-half of the motel:
   - There are 90 rooms in total.
   - One-half of 90 rooms is \( 90 \div 2 = 45 \) rooms.

2. Next, calculate the total time needed to clean 45 rooms:
   - It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.
   - For 45 rooms, the total time is \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) minutes.

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - \( 900 \) minutes is \( 900 \div 60 = 15 \) hours.

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as the first year. So, they will build:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say my age is \( x \).
2. My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is \( x + 3 \).
3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is \( x - 2 \).
4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

Now, we know that the sum of all our ages is 87:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Let's simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 6x = 87 - 9 \]
\[ 6x = 78 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks, so we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this, we need to calculate how the number of infected people grows each day.

- **Day 0:** We start with 10 infected people.
- **Day 1:** Each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected. The total number of infected people is now 10 (original) + 60 (new) = 70.
- **Day 2:** Now, each of these 70 people infects 6 others, so 70 * 6 = 420 new people are infected. The total number of infected people is now 70 (from Day 1) + 420 (new) = 490.
- **Day 3:** Each of these 490 people infects 6 others, so 490 * 6 = 2940 new people are infected. The total number of infected people is now 490 (from Day 2) + 2940 (new) = 3430.

"First, let's figure out how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate this by multiplying 40 by 20.

40 customers * $20/customer = $800

Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate 10% of $800.

10% of $800 = 0.10 * $800 = $80

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. We subtract this from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total.

$800 - $80 = $720

Julieta received $720 in tips.

Now, to find out how much they received together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips.

$800 + $720 = $1520

So, the total amount of tips they received together is $1520.

   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - This means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.

"To find out how many burritos were leftover, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos used (by students and Mr. George) from the original number of burritos ordered.

First, let's calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- So, the total number of burritos given to the students is \( 50 \times 10 = 500 \) burritos.

Next, we add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Now, we add the burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George to find the total number of burritos used:
- Total burritos used = 500 (students) + 20 (Mr. George) = 520 burritos.

Finally, we subtract the total number of burritos used from the original number of burritos ordered:
- Original number of burritos ordered = 600.

Now, we know the total number of books they have together is 85:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate 1/4 of 80:
1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the 20 marbles he lost from the 80 marbles he had:
80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find out how many points Amy scores, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question and then add them together.

1. **Multiple-choice questions:**
   - There are 10 multiple-choice questions.
   - Amy answers 80% of them correctly.
   - Number of correct answers = 10 * 80% = 10 * 0.8 = 8
   - Each correct answer is worth 1 point.
   - Points from multiple-choice questions = 8 * 1 = 8 points

2. **True/false questions:**
   - There are 20 true/false questions.
   - Amy answers 90% of them correctly.
   - Number of correct answers = 20 * 90% = 20 * 0.9 = 18
   - Each correct answer is worth 1 point.
   - Points from true/false questions = 18 * 1 = 18 points

3. **Long-answer questions:**
   - There are 5 long-answer questions.
   - Amy answers 60% of them correctly.
   - Number of correct answers = 5 * 60% = 5 * 0.6 = 3
   - Each correct answer is worth 5 points.
   - Points from long-answer questions = 3 * 5 = 15 points

Now, we add up all the points:
- Total points = Points from multiple-choice + Points from true/false + Points from long-answer
- Total points = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41

"To find out how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Since the profit is the total revenue minus the cost, we can find the cost by subtracting the profit from the total revenue.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them:

\[ 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 each:

\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. The profit is the total revenue minus the cost. So, we can find the cost by subtracting the profit from the total revenue:

\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000.

"First, we need to find out how many glasses of lemonade the boys sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and they sold 32 glasses in total, we subtract Julie's sales from the total sales:

32 - 14 = 18

This means the boys sold 18 glasses of lemonade together. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:

18 ÷ 2 = 9

So, each boy sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's figure out how much Iris spent on the manicure. She spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, which was $400. So, the cost of the manicure is:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, which was $100. So, the cost of the pedicure is:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount Iris spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount Iris spent at the spa is:

"First, let's figure out how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope. She has a rope that is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money Sarah will get is:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, we need to find out how much of this money Sarah will spend on buying a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. If she buys a new rope that is also 20 meters long, the cost will be:

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling her old rope:

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after she buys the new rope.

"First, let's figure out Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18, we can find her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.

18 - 10 = 8

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

3 * 8 = 24

We need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old. Since she is currently 8 years old, we subtract her current age from 24 to find the number of years:

24 - 8 = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's figure out the cost of each item Kelly is buying.

1. The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack} \]

2. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet of chicken} \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so:
   \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so:
   \[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack of apples} \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first figure out the length of the final concert without the encore. The final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes long. The encore itself is 15 minutes, so the actual concert time (without the encore) is:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Elaina made this concert twice as long as her usual concerts. So, to find the length of her usual concerts, we divide the concert time by 2:

50 minutes ÷ 2 = 25 minutes

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the number of toys he started with.

First, add up the toys given away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Now, subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys:
200 - 150 = 50 toys

So, Argo has 50 toys left.

"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on those three days, we need to add up the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which means 2 times 125 chimichangas.

Let's calculate the total:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 2 * 125 (Friday) = 125 + 125 + 250 = 500

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"First, we need to find out how many microphones won't fit in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones won't fit in pairs. So, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

1. Calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
   - Joelle has 5 orchids.
   - Each orchid has 5 petals.
   - Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

2. Calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
   - Joelle has 4 African daisies.
   - Each daisy has 10 petals.
   - Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

3. Find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
   - Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
   - Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants:

100 plants * 1/4 = 25 indoor plants

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left after the indoor plants are accounted for:

100 plants - 25 indoor plants = 75 plants

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants:

75 plants * 2/3 = 50 outdoor plants

Now, we can find out how many flowering plants there are by subtracting the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:

100 plants - 25 indoor plants - 50 outdoor plants = 25 flowering plants

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

(25 flowering plants / 100 total plants) * 100 = 25%

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to figure out the speed of a thingamabob first, since the whirligig's speed is based on the thingamabob's speed.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
2. The whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

So, to find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times.
   - Therefore, Tasha made \( 6x \) dollars from mowing Joe's lawn.

2. **Calculate the number of times Tasha mowed other lawns:**
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

3. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - If Joe paid $6 for \( x \) times, then Kamala and Alba paid the same rate.
   - Earnings from Kamala's lawn: \( 6 \times 3x = 18x \) dollars.
   - Earnings from Alba's lawn: \( 6 \times 5x = 30x \) dollars.
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns: \( 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \) dollars.

4. **Determine the value of \( x \):**
   - We know Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + 54x = 80 \).

5. **Find the value of \( x \):**
   - Since Joe paid $6, and \( x \) is the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, we need to find \( x \) such that the total earnings from mowing lawns plus lemonade sales equal $80.
   - We know \( 54x \) is the total earnings from mowing lawns.
   - If \( x = 1 \), then \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) dollars from mowing lawns.
   - Therefore, \( L + 54 = 80 \).
   - Solving for \( L \): \( L = 80 - 54 = 26 \).

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.
   - Daniel read 0 pages today.

3. **Calculate the pages Denise read today:**
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
   - Denise read 5 more than 13 pages today.
   - So, Denise read \( 13 + 5 = 18 \) pages today.

4. **Total pages read by each:**
   - Denise: \( 10 \) pages yesterday + \( 18 \) pages today = \( 28 \) pages.
   - Daniel: \( 13 \) pages yesterday + \( 0 \) pages today = \( 13 \) pages.

5. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - Denise read \( 28 \) pages.

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, and everyone eats one bowl at a meal, we need to figure out how much soup is left after dinner.

First, let's see how much soup is used for dinner:
- Calvin (1 adult bowl)
- His wife (1 adult bowl)
- Two children (2 child bowls)

Since 1 adult bowl is the same as 2 child bowls, the total soup used for dinner is:
- 2 adult bowls = 4 child bowls
- 2 child bowls

So, the total is 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The pot originally has 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the leftover soup is:
8 - 6 = 2 child bowls

Each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will get 1 bowl.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- William bought 1 ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ballpen is \( 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
- Total cost = Cost of notebooks + Cost of ballpen

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks: \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, Jo will need: \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks: \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, Jo will need: \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes. An extreme Sudoku takes 4 times that long, so:
45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

Now, John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:
180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of red balloons and the bologna thrown at them:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - There are 20 red balloons.
   - Total bologna thrown at red balloons: \( 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \).

2. **Determine the total bologna thrown at yellow balloons:**
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - Bologna thrown at red balloons: 40 pieces.
   - Bologna thrown at yellow balloons: \( 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces at red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna} \).

3. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Total bologna thrown at yellow balloons: \( 3y = 18 \).
   - Solve for \( y \): \( y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

"First, let's figure out how many miles Jon drives in a 30-day month. He drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we know his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs in 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he worked on Tuesday, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for all three days:
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours

So, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to add up all the expenses they had and then divide that total by 2, since the money came from both of their allowances combined.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of the balloons: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons means 12 / 2 = 6 sets of 2 balloons, so 6 * $0.5 = $3.
3. The cost of the ice cream: 2 tubs at $7 each, so 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since this total amount of $28 was from the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, we divide it by 2 to find out how much each one received:
$28 / 2 = $14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"First, let's figure out how many students are playing each sport.

For tennis, there are 6 students.
For volleyball, there are twice as many students as tennis, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 students.

For soccer, there are 16 boys and 22 girls, so that's 16 + 22 = 38 students.

Now, let's add up all the students from each sport:
6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students.

So, the total number of students is 56.

"To find out how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each student sold 10 lollipops.
- There are 30 students.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Step 3: Total cost of buying the lollipops
- Each lollipop cost $0.5 to buy.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Step 4: Profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets: \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

"First, let's figure out how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat:

2 slices/day * 2 = 4 slices/day

Now, let's add how many slices both Abby and Josh can eat together in one day:

2 slices/day (Abby) + 4 slices/day (Josh) = 6 slices/day

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

24 slices / 6 slices/day = 4 days

"To find out how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months between her 5th and 10th birthdays.

- Martha starts collecting shells at age 5.
- She collects one shell every month.
- From age 5 to age 10, there are 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by the number of months in a year:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"First, let's figure out how many cups of tea Lana has left after brewing the cinnamon tea. She started with 27 cups and used 15 for cinnamon tea:

27 - 15 = 12 cups

These 12 cups are divided equally into chamomile and mint tea. So, half of these 12 cups are mint tea:

12 / 2 = 6 cups of mint tea

These 6 cups of mint tea are then divided equally into 3 rows:

6 / 3 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours and then determine how many berries he needs to pick up per trip to reach a total of 24 berries.

1. First, we know that one trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours.
2. In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he can make 2 trips in that time, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

So, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12.

"First, we need to find out how much water Anthony and his father put into the tank. They filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10,000 gallons, half of that is:

10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons

Now, the tank is being emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find out how much water is used in 6 days, we multiply the daily rate by the number of days:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3,000 gallons

To find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank:

5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

"First, let's figure out how much money Colby has spent so far this month.

- He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, so that's 5 * $10 = $50.
- He saw 8 movies on other days, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.
- He got 2 tubs of popcorn, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.
- He got 4 boxes of candy, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

Now, let's add up all the money he has spent:
$50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so he has:
$150 - $130 = $20 left.

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for that would be:
$10 (movie ticket) + $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $20.

Since he has exactly $20 left, he can see 1 more movie tonight.

"To find out how many calories all the pastries Andrew baked have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's find the calories in one mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
- So, one mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \div 3 = 200 \) calories.

Next, let's find the total calories for all 200 mini cinnamon rolls:
- Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories.
- So, 200 mini cinnamon rolls have \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

Now, let's find the calories in one mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
- So, one mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \div 3 = 150 \) calories.

Next, let's find the total calories for all 300 mini blueberry muffins:
- Each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.
- So, 300 mini blueberry muffins have \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40,000
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45,000
- Total calories from all pastries: \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \)

So, the total number of calories in all the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday:**
   - Monday: 39 Junebugs
   - Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
   - Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
   - Thursday: 48 Junebugs
   - Friday: 57 Junebugs

2. **Add up all the Junebugs removed:**
   - Total = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

3. **Calculate the sum:**
   - 39 + 78 = 117
   - 117 + 78 = 195
   - 195 + 48 = 243
   - 243 + 57 = 300

4. **Count the number of days:**
   - There are 5 days (Monday to Friday).

5. **Calculate the average:**
   - Average = Total number of Junebugs / Number of days
   - Average = 300 / 5
   - Average = 60

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each one traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance the bus traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance the car traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

First, we add these numbers together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, we know the total number of toys is 62. To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the number of other toys from the total number of toys:
62 - 48 = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say John's age is \( J \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and John's ages, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( J \):
\[ J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, John is 20 years old.

Now, let's find Paul's age:
\[ J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And Peter's age:
\[ 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter is 50 years old.

"First, let's figure out how many people are playing the water balloon fight. Maria invited 4 friends, and she is also playing, so that's 5 people in total.

At the start, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, 4 friends × 2 balloons each = 8 balloons.

Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.

So, at the start, the total number of balloons is 8 (for friends) + 1 (for Maria) = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, that's 5 people × 3 balloons each = 15 more balloons.

Adding the balloons given by Maria's mom to the initial total, we get 9 (initial) + 15 (from mom) = 24 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24.

50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Next, we need to find out how many tables are needed to fit all 60 boxes, given that 2 boxes fit per table:
60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

   - Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

2. **Sydney's total distance:**
   - Sydney has 35 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 12 feet.
   - Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

3. **Combined total distance:**
   - Combined total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
   - Combined total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

4. **Average total distance:**
   - To find the average, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (2).
   - Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

"To figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then find out how much money that would be.

First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine can produce in one hour:
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets per hour
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets per hour

Next, we calculate the number of widgets each machine can produce in one day (24 hours):
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Now, we calculate the number of widgets each machine can produce in a month (30 days):
- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43200 widgets/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32400 widgets/month

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets:
- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6/widget = $259200
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6/widget = $194400

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:
- Difference: $259200 - $194400 = $64800

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

"First, let's figure out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate the amount for the sheep like this:

Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.
Three pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds for each sheep.

Now, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep.

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

Adding these together gives the total amount of hay Nate needs:

First, there's a fixed charge for visiting the house, which is $40.

Next, we calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the charge is $35 per hour. Since they charge for the whole hour even if it's part of an hour, we round 2.25 up to 3 hours. So, the labor cost is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Finally, there's the cost of the parts, which is $60.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$40 (visit charge) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205

So, Patty charged $205 for the job.

"First, let's figure out how much James paid for each CD with the discount. 

The original price of each CD is $15. With a 40% discount, he pays 60% of the original price. 

60% of $15 is calculated as:
\[ 15 \times 0.60 = 9 \]

So, each CD costs him $9.

Since he gets 10 CDs, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \times 9 = 90 \]

Next, he sells 5 of the CDs for $40. So, he gets $40 back.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then add them all together.

First, for the yams:
- Jen has 6 yams.
- Each yam can be sold for $1.5.
- So, the total from yams is 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

Next, for the sweet potatoes:
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato can be sold for $2.
- So, the total from sweet potatoes is 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

Finally, for the carrots:
- Jen has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot can be sold for $1.25.
- So, the total from carrots is 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Now, we add the totals from each type of root crop:
- Total earnings = $9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34.

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 12 \) miles / \( 2 \) miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swimming time.
   - Rest time = \( 6 \) hours / 2 = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed = \( 2 \) miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( 8 \) miles / \( 1 \) mile per hour = 8 hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Initial swimming time = 6 hours.
   - Rest time = 3 hours.
   - Time for remaining distance = 8 hours.
   - Total time = \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

The bakery has 40 less than this amount, so we subtract 40 from 490:
490 - 40 = 450

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy is 10% of $5, which is \(0.10 \times 5 = 0.50\) dollars.
- He sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times is \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy is 8% of $15, which is \(0.08 \times 15 = 1.20\) dollars.
- He sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \(10 \times 1.20 = 12.00\) dollars.

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00

So, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15.00.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. We know the total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.
3. Let's use variables to represent the points scored by each person:
   - Let \( B \) be the points scored by Bahati.
   - Let \( A \) be the points scored by Azibo.
   - Let \( D \) be the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- \( B = A + 20 \)
- \( B = D + 10 \)

We also know the total points:
- \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- \( A = B - 20 \)
- \( D = B - 10 \)

Now, substitute these into the total points equation:
- \( B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \)

Combine like terms:
- \( B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \)
- \( 3B - 30 = 45 \)

Add 30 to both sides:
- \( 3B = 75 \)

Divide by 3:
- \( B = 25 \)

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
- \( A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \)
- \( D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \)

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find out how many pages are in the book, we first need to figure out how many sheets of paper are in 1.5 inches. Since there are 100 pages per inch, and each sheet of paper has two pages (one on each side), we can calculate the number of sheets and then the total number of pages.

1. Calculate the number of sheets in 1.5 inches:
   - 100 pages per inch means 50 sheets per inch (since each sheet has 2 pages).
   - For 1.5 inches: \( 50 \text{ sheets/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 75 \text{ sheets} \).

2. Calculate the total number of pages:
   - Each sheet has 2 pages, so \( 75 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages/sheet} = 150 \text{ pages} \).

So, the book has 150 pages.

"First, let's figure out how many minutes Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. That's 15 hours.

15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. Let's find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes.

900 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can find the total number of reports by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval.

60 intervals × 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the extra time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes
   - Subtract the time spent sleepwalking: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes
   - Subtract the extra time she woke up early: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

"First, let's figure out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, that means he has 24 measuring cups (because one dozen equals 12).

Now, to find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons left with Jonathan is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
\[ 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's figure out how many beds are occupied at the start. The hospital has 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied:

1000 beds * 1/5 = 200 beds

So, 200 beds are occupied at the start.

Next, we need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day:

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, let's add these 700 patients to the 200 beds that were already occupied:

200 beds + 700 patients = 900 beds

So, 900 beds are occupied after 2 weeks. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the occupied beds from the total capacity:

1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 beds

"First, let's figure out how many emails Robyn sends that are not work emails. She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of those are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, so:

2/3 * 9 = 6 emails

This means 6 emails are sent to family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. We know that one-third of the remaining emails (after work and family) are to her boyfriend. The remaining emails after sending to family are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails

One-third of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend:

1/3 * 3 = 1 email

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"First, let's find out how old Shawna is. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age like this:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can find out Shawna's father's age by:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

"If Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but she overstated the number by 20%, we need to find out what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let's say the actual number of people is \( x \). Courtney's count of 48 is 120% of \( x \) because she overstated by 20%.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first figure out the total number of holes they had dug by the end of the third day.

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\).

Now, let's add these up to find the total number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes. So, four times this number is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

This means by the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes in total. Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

"To find out how much the travel costs, we first need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies. The supplies cost $400.

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times 0.50 = 200 \]

The travel costs 50% more than the supplies, so we add this 50% to the original cost of the supplies:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the travel costs $600.

"To solve this problem, let's use some algebra. We'll set up equations based on the information given.

Let's say:
- \( A \) is the number of Pokemon Alex has caught,
- \( S \) is the number of Pokemon Stan has caught,
- \( W \) is the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A + S + W = 339 \) (total Pokemon caught)
2. \( A = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4W - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + 5 + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, we can substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we know \( W = 40 \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4W - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to figure out the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The total number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, the total number of episodes is \(20 \div 2 = 10\).

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show:
- Multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: \(10 \times 20 = 200\) minutes.

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance the bird traveled in each direction and then sum the distances traveled south.

1. **Distance traveled south in the first part:**
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 10 hours × 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

2. **Distance traveled north:**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 2 hours × 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

3. **Distance traveled south in the second part:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 5 hours × 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Now, we sum the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

- Total distance south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
- Total distance north = 36 miles

- Net distance south = Total distance south - Total distance north = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Batch:**
   - Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   - 1 dozen = 12 brownies.

2. **From the Office:**
   - She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   - 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies.

3. **Surprise Party:**
   - Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies.
   - 4 dozen = 48 brownies.

4. **Total Brownies Before Eating:**
   - Add all the brownies together:
   - 12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

5. **Brownies Eaten:**
   - During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   - 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies.

6. **Brownies Left:**
   - Subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies:
   - 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

"First, let's figure out the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so:
Brother's age = 2 × 8 = 16 years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age:
25% of 8 = 0.25 × 8 = 2 years.

So, Nani's sister is 2 years younger than Nani:
Sister's age = 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three:
Nani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30

First, we need to figure out how many boxes of each item Sunny sold on both days.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer than Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more than Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Let's find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Sunday:
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's find out how many boxes of apple pie he sold on Saturday:
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
- So, on Saturday, he sold \( 15 - 4 = 11 \) boxes of apple pie.

Next, let's find out how many boxes of gingerbread he sold on Sunday:
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday.
- So, on Sunday, he sold \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) boxes of gingerbread.

Now we have the total number of boxes sold each day:
- **Saturday:**
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
  - Apple pie: 11 boxes

- **Sunday:**
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes
  - Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day.

**Saturday:**
- Earnings from gingerbread: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie: \( 11 \times 15 = 165 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 60 + 165 = 225 \) dollars

**Sunday:**
- Earnings from gingerbread: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \) dollars

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to find the total earnings:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are in these groups:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

So, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, then Charlie's boots are:

5 * 5 = 25

To find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

"To figure out how much money Pat will spend, we need to first determine how many more flowers she needs to buy to fill up her flower bed.

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet**: Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant needs**: Each plant needs 1 foot for itself and 1.5 feet of space, so each plant needs a total of 2.5 feet of space.

3. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant needs:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate how many more plants Pat needs to buy**: Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs:
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost**: Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is:
   \[
   27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Pat will spend **162** dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to figure out how many pretzels he eats in a day. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzels} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Now, to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzels} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

"To find out how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of 3 petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00
- Cost of 2 sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 per vine = $5.00

Now, add the costs together to get the total cost for one basket:
- Total cost for one basket = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
- Total cost for 5 baskets = $14.00 * 5 = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"First, let's figure out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (for sunflowers) + 15 pounds (for carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the soil left for the roses is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"First, let's figure out how much Jessica saves each month for shoes. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of that for shoes.

25% of $2,000.00 is:
\[ 2,000.00 \times 0.25 = 500.00 \]

So, she saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, let's find out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 500.00 \times 12 = 6,000.00 \]

Now, each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she saves in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes:
\[ 6,000.00 \div 1,000.00 = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can cook in one batch and then multiply by the time it takes to cook one batch:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
     \[
     3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - Add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Air conditioner on low for 3 hours:**
   - It cools 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, it cools \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Air conditioner on high for 4 hours:**
   - It cools 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, it cools \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Total cooling:**
   - Total cooling from both low and high settings: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.

4. **Air conditioner off for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, it warms up \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

5. **Final temperature change:**
   - The room was cooled by 18 degrees and then warmed up by 4 degrees.
   - Net change in temperature: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time difference between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - \(90 - 75 = 15\)

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. **Electric bill**: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks
2. **Gas bill**: 1 check per month × 12 months = 12 checks
3. **Church**: 2 checks per month × 12 months = 24 checks
4. **Pest and lawn service**: 1 check per quarter × 4 quarters = 4 checks

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes:
   \[
   44 \times 2 = 88 \text{ trips}
   \]

2. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, the number of flights to Greece is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \text{ flights}
   \]

3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The number of remaining flights is:
   \[
   88 - 66 = 22 \text{ flights}
   \]

4. Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
   \[
   \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ flights}
   \]

So, the number of flights to France is 11.

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"First, let's figure out how much money Adam's father gave him. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so:

Father's contribution = 2 × Mother's contribution
Father's contribution = 2 × $6 = $12

Now, let's add up all the money Adam received from his parents:

Total from parents = Mother's contribution + Father's contribution
Total from parents = $6 + $12 = $18

Adam bought the trousers for $30, so the amount he had to contribute from his savings is:

Amount from savings = Total cost - Total from parents
Amount from savings = $30 - $18 = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by figuring out the average age of the group and then use that to find Helene's age. We know the total age of the children is 20.

1. First, we calculate the average age of the group:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age of the group}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

2. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group:
   \[
   \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:
   - Akbar: 3 years
   - Alessandro: 4 years
   - Helene: 10 years

4. We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the group:
   \[
   \text{Wilfred's age} = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10) = 20 - 17 = 3

"First, let's find out how many cookies there were in total at the wedding. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give 1/2 of these cookies to the church. So, we need to find out how many cookies that is:

1500 cookies * 1/2 = 750 cookies

Now, if each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can find out how many people were in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, 50 people were in the church next door.

"To solve this, let's think about how the slices of the watermelon are divided.

1. Let's say each kid gets 1 part of the watermelon.
2. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult gets 2 parts.
3. There are 4 kids, so the kids together get 4 parts.
4. There are 2 adults, so the adults together get 4 parts (2 parts each).

Now, let's add up all the parts:
- Kids: 4 parts
- Adults: 4 parts
- Total: 4 + 4 = 8 parts

Each adult gets 2 parts out of the total 8 parts. To find the percentage, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of parts each adult gets}}{\text{Total number of parts}} \right) \times 100

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

"First, let's figure out how much time Doctor Jones spends on each task.

1. **Rounds for inpatients:** He has 9 inpatients, and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient.
   - \( 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \)
   - Convert 180 minutes to hours: \( 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Appointments:** He has 10 appointments, and each takes 30 minutes.
   - \( 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \)

"To figure out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake and then count backwards from 5:00 pm.

First, let's add up all the time:
- Making the batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add these times together:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the same as 3 hours.

So, Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake from start to finish. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, she needs to start 3 hours before that.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Let's call the number of chocolate bars in one box \( x \).

The total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter can be represented as:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:

"To find out how much the dance studio earns in a month, we need to calculate the total cost and then determine the earnings. However, the problem doesn't specify the charge per student or the total number of weeks in the month, so I'll assume the studio charges a fee to cover the costs and make a profit, and we'll calculate based on a typical 4-week month.

1. **Calculate the weekly cost:**
   - **Studio rental cost per week:** $25 per session * 3 sessions = $75
   - **Cost per student per session:** $1.50 * 10 students = $15 per session
   - **Total cost per student for 3 sessions:** $15 * 3 = $45
   - **Total cost for all students per week:** $45 * 10 students = $450

2. **Total weekly cost:**
   - **Total cost per week:** $75 (studio rental) + $450 (student costs) = $525

3. **Monthly cost:**
   - **Total cost per month (4 weeks):** $525 * 4 = $2100

Since the problem asks for the expected earnings and not the profit, and it doesn't specify the income, the expected earnings would be the total cost, which is the amount the studio needs to cover.

"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, we first need to figure out how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population of 50 porcupines.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, in one month, the total number of babies born is:

Babies born in one month = 30 * 4 = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Babies born in one year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the number of babies born in a year to the original population to find the total population after a year:

Total population after a year = Original population + Babies born in one year
Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Use the volume to find out how many gallons of water are needed.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular shape, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

Next, let's calculate how far Shandy traveled. Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Again, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

4. The remaining students over 16 years old are female, so:
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125

"First, let's figure out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank:
1/4 of 18,000 gallons = 18,000 / 4 = 4,500 gallons

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda did on the first day:
3/4 of 4,500 gallons = 4,500 * 3/4 = 3,375 gallons

So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is:
4,500 gallons (Wanda) + 3,375 gallons (Ms. B) = 7,875 gallons

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
2/3 of 4,500 gallons = 4,500 * 2/3 = 3,000 gallons

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:
1/3 of 3,375 gallons = 3,375 * 1/3 = 1,125 gallons

So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is:
3,000 gallons (Wanda) + 1,125 gallons (Ms. B) = 4,125 gallons

Now, let's add the water pumped on both days to find the total amount of water in the tank:
7,875 gallons (first day) + 4,125 gallons (second day) = 12,000 gallons

Finally, to find out how many gallons are remaining to fill the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity:
18,000 gallons (total capacity) - 12,000 gallons (pumped) = 6,000 gallons

   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - So, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - So, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"First, let's figure out how much Janet makes in a week. She makes $10 an hour from her wages and $15 an hour from tips, so that's $25 an hour in total. If she works 40 hours a week, she makes:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 if she saves all her earnings. Since she makes $1000 per week, we divide the total amount she needs by her weekly earnings:

\[ 2000 \div 1000 = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's figure out how much Jamaar has spent so far.

- He bought 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- He bought 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- He bought 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up all the costs to see how much he has spent in total:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so let's see how much he has left:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can find out how many plums he can buy by dividing the money he has left by the cost of one plum:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"First, let's find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. She had 15 packs and kept 2, so she gave away:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets are in those 13 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces:

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally, so each friend received:

780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces/friend

So, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is similar to calculating the growth of the price. The formula is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial price is $120, the rate is 5% (or 0.05 as a decimal), and the number of years is 3.

First, we calculate the factor by which the price increases each year:
\[ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 \]

Next, we raise this factor to the power of 3 (for three years):
\[ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply the initial price by this factor:
\[ 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding 138.915 to the nearest integer gives us:
\[ 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.

"First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits. So, we can find out the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of pictures per album by the number of albums for each type:

Selfies: 3 albums × 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies
Portraits: 2 albums × 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the two amounts together:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to figure out how many minutes it takes him to read 18 pages. We know that he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. 

First, we find out how many sets of 3 pages are in 18 pages:
18 pages ÷ 3 pages/set = 6 sets

Since it takes him 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set:
6 sets × 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests is now:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests is now:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
   So the number of guests is now:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the number of guests is now:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

So, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add up the bananas he picked each day.

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday, which is 3 times 4, so that's 12 bananas.

Now, we add them all together:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

So, John has 22 bananas in total.

"First, let's figure out how many questions are easy, average, and difficult.

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of these are easy:
\[ 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \text{ easy questions} \]

The rest of the questions are 60 - 24 = 36 questions. These are equally divided into average and difficult questions:
\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \text{ average questions} \]
\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \text{ difficult questions} \]

Now, let's calculate how many questions Aries is sure to get right.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
\[ 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \text{ easy questions correct} \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct:
\[ 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ average questions correct} \]
\[ 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ difficult questions correct} \]

Adding these up gives the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
\[ 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \]

So, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the price of a large stuffed animal:**
   - Since a large stuffed animal costs three times as much as a small one, and a small one costs $4, a large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of small and large stuffed animals sold:**
   - Let \(L\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so she sold \(2L\) small stuffed animals.

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from small stuffed animals is \(4 \times 2L = 8L\) dollars.
   - The total earnings from large stuffed animals is \(12 \times L = 12L\) dollars.
   - The total earnings from all sales is \(8L + 12L = 20L\) dollars.

4. **Set up the equation based on the total earnings:**
   - Teresa earned $120 in total, so \(20L = 120\).

5. **Solve for \(L\):**
   - \(L = \frac{120}{20} = 6\).

6. **Determine the number of small stuffed animals sold:**
   - Since she sold \(2L\) small stuffed animals, she sold \(2 \times 6 = 12\) small stuffed animals.

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by 7 days.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, add up the sandwiches eaten by the family each day:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Now, multiply the daily total by 7 to find the weekly total:

"First, let's figure out how much money Suzanne made from selling the cookies and cupcakes.

From the cookies:
80 cookies * $1 per cookie = $80

From the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4 per cupcake = $240

Now, let's add the money from the cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so:
2 sisters * $10 each = $20

Now, let's subtract the money given to her sisters from her total earnings:
$320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"First, let's figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.

1. A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, 50% of 24 pounds is 24 * 0.5 = 12 pounds.
4. Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate how much 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per dwarf = 1440 pounds per day.

Finally, let's find out how much they can mine in 30 days:
1440 pounds per day * 30 days = 43200 pounds.

"To solve this, we need to see if the prices are proportional based on the number of sandwiches. 

First, let's look at the price per sandwich for the first two packages:
- For the first package, 2 sandwiches cost $3, so each sandwich costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.
- For the second package, 4 sandwiches cost $6, so each sandwich costs $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the price per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can assume the price per sandwich is $1.50 for all packages.

Now, for the third package with 8 sandwiches:
- The cost for 8 sandwiches would be 8 * $1.50 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"First, let's figure out how many red balloons burst. Sally had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. 

40% of 25 is:
\[ 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \] red balloons.

Next, she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She had 12 yellow balloons, so half of them is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \] yellow balloons.

She found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her clutch. 

75% of 8 is:
\[ 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up all the balloons she has left:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6

"To figure out the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to look at all the different scenarios where he might not have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher, and if there is, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.
   - So, the chance he doesn't have to turn it in because of a substitute is 50%.

2. **Normal Teacher Gives Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher is there (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension to the whole class.
   - The combined chance for this scenario is 50% (normal teacher) * 40% (extension) = 20%.

3. **Marcus Gets Personal Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher is there (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension to the whole class (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension.
   - The combined chance for this scenario is 50% (normal teacher) * 60% (no class extension) * 20% (personal extension) = 6%.

Now, we add up all the chances where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher gives class extension: 20%
- Marcus gets personal extension: 6%

Total chance Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework = 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

So, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%.

"First, let's figure out how much Melissa earns in total from her jury duty. She is paid $15 per day and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day, and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out how much she makes after expenses:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total number of hours she spends is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the total number of hours she worked:

"First, let's figure out how much money Jim borrowed for college. He borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years.

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Jim lost by not working during the 4 years he was in college. He would have earned $25,000 each year.

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

So, the total amount of money Jim needs to make up is the sum of the loans and the lost income.

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Now, let's find out what Jim's new income is after college. His degree tripled his income from $25,000 a year.

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 with his new income, we divide the total amount by his new annual income.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to figure out the dimensions of the fabric pieces he needs. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric piece will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of the fabric piece will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we need to find the area of one piece of fabric:
Area = length × width
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total fabric needed = 80 square feet × 2
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole was already 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say the first person took \( x \) dollars.
2. The second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars.
3. The third person took twice what the second person took, so that's \( 2(x + 80) \) dollars.

"First, let's figure out how many days are in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 21 days.

Next, we need to find out how many days of work the painters did in total. They worked for 3/8 of a day each day, so we multiply 21 days by 3/8:
\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
\[ 7.875 \times 24 = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked:

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is \( x \).
2. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

We know the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. So, we can write the equation:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, first combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory retrieved 6 balls. 

Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

1. First, determine the number of years from 2007 to 2010:
   \[
   2010 - 2007 = 3 \text{ years}
   \]

2. The formula to calculate the price after depreciation is:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}}
   \]

3. Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3
   \]

4. Calculate \(0.79^3\):
   \[
   0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493
   \]

5. Now, multiply the initial price by this factor:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493 \approx 9860
   \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.

9860"
"First, let's figure out how many books are in each language.

- Total books: 50
- English books: Half of 50 = 50 / 2 = 25
- German books: 10% of 50 = 50 * 0.10 = 5

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books.

- Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. 

So, we multiply 325 kilometers by 4 days:
325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance from San Diego to New York City:
1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

655"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in that time. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. So, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon:
\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (100 people) board the train:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off the train:

"Let's break down the costs:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8, but with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.

"To find out how much it will cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to figure out how many tiles you will need and then multiply that by the cost of each tile.

1. First, we need to know how many tiles will cover the kitchen floor. Since each tile is 1 square foot (because each side is 1 foot), and your kitchen floor is 200 square feet, you will need 200 tiles.
2. Next, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile. Each tile costs $12, so:
   200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400.

"First, we need to find out how much more James has to pay each month because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it's 60% more because of the accident.

60% of $120 is calculated as:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the extra cost per month is $72.

Now, we add this extra cost to the normal cost to find the total monthly cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

James pays $192 each month. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year.

"To figure out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Weekly Laundry Loads:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
   - He can wash 2 twin sets of sheets in one load and 1 king set of sheets in one load.
   - For the twin beds: 4 twin sets / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads.
   - For the king bed: 1 king set / 1 king set per load = 1 load.
   - Total weekly loads = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads.

2. **Yearly Laundry Loads:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total yearly loads = 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads.

So, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year.

"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday compared to Saturday.
   - Half of 4 movies is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
   - Total for one weekend: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - They watch 6 movies each weekend.
   - Over 4 weeks, they watch \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) movies.

So, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24.

"To find out how many stickers Leo has now, we need to add up the stickers he had and collected over the past years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers at the end of last year.
This year, he collected twice as many stickers as he did last year, which means he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers this year.

Adding this year's stickers to his collection, Leo now has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of food the cats eat in one day.
2. Divide the total amount of food Imma has by the amount the cats eat in one day.

First, since Imma feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams each time, the total amount of food per feeding for all 3 cats is:
60 grams/feeding × 2 feedings/day = 120 grams/day

Now, we divide the total amount of food Imma has by the amount the cats eat in one day:
720 grams ÷ 120 grams/day = 6 days

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days.

"First, let's figure out how many slices Jake ate. We know Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and Becky ate 10 slices. So, Jake ate:

10 slices - 3 slices = 7 slices

Now, let's find out how many slices Silvia ate. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:

2 * 7 slices = 14 slices

Now, we add up all the slices they ate:

Becky: 10 slices
Jake: 7 slices
Silvia: 14 slices

10 slices + 7 slices + 14 slices = 31 slices

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31.

"Let's figure this out step by step. If we call the time Donovan spent on his part \( D \) minutes, then Betsy spent \( D + 18 \) minutes on her part. The total time they spent together is 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find out the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the different costs:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 per hour for a visit. Since the visit lasted 30 minutes, which is half an hour, the cost is $300/2 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill. For 30 pills, the cost is 30 * $4 = $120.
4. The parking fee is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482.

"First, we need to find out how many emails James responds to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require a response, that means 80% do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as:
0.80 * 80 = 64 emails per day

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
64 * 5 = 320 emails

- On Wednesday, three times as many as Monday visited, so that's 32 * 3 = 96 classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247

"First, let's figure out how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is \( 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \) pizzas.
So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas and has \( 20 - 14 = 6 \) pizzas left.

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means they ordered \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
80% of 40 is \( 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \) pizzas.
So, the football team ate 32 pizzas and has \( 40 - 32 = 8 \) pizzas left.

Now, we add the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:
\( 6 + 8 = 14 \) pizzas.

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

First, let's figure out how many big coupons Anthony is sending:
- He sends out 700 small coupons.
- He sends out twice as many big coupons, so that's \(700 \times 2 = 1400\) big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost for the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail.
- So, the total cost for the small coupons is \(700 \times 5 = 3500\) cents.

Now, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail.
- So, the total cost for the big coupons is \(1400 \times 15 = 21000\) cents.

Finally, we add the costs together to get the total amount spent on postage:
- Total cost = cost for small coupons + cost for big coupons
- Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = \(24500 \div 100 = 245\) dollars

So, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage.

"To figure out how much Dennis will spend on butter, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the other pound.

3. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - For every 2 pounds, he pays $4.00 for the first pound and $2.00 (half of $4.00) for the second pound.
   - So, for 2 pounds, the total cost is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.
   - Since he needs 6 pounds, he will buy 3 sets of 2 pounds.
   - The total cost for 6 pounds is 3 sets * $6.00 = $18.00.

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

45 - 4 = 41 people

The theater costs $125 for the first 20 people. For the additional guests, we need to pay $6 for each one. Since 41 people are coming, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21 people

The cost for these additional guests is:

21 * 6 = $126

Now, we add the base cost of the theater to the cost for the additional guests:

125 + 126 = $251

So, the total cost for the party is $251.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total bananas for a week:**
   Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days).

2. **Bananas eaten by the first monkey:**
   The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   So, in a week, the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. **Bananas eaten by the second monkey:**
   The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   So, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Total bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:**
   \[
   70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. **Bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week:**
   The total number of bananas is 315, and the first and second monkeys together eat 168 bananas.
   So, the third monkey eats:
   \[
   315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

6. **Bananas eaten by the third monkey each day:**
   The third monkey eats 147 bananas in a week, so each day the third monkey eats:
   \[
   \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"First, let's figure out how much Jenny spends on the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, we can calculate the cost in two ways: by the dozen or by the single price.

- A dozen roses cost $15, so for 12 roses, she pays $15.
- For the remaining 3 roses, at $2 each, she pays 3 * $2 = $6.

So, the total cost for 15 roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which means she had 5 * $5 = $25.

The amount of money she has left after buying the roses is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to figure out how many quarters make up $4. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:

$4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters

"First, let's figure out how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been saving for 12 weeks. So, we multiply 10 by 12:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200. We subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total she needs:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week to find out how many more weeks she needs to save:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

So, Mr. Rogers bought the watch for $1500.

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid for it.

120% of $1500 = 1.20 * $1500 = $1800

So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for $1800.

Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price of $2000.

The discount amount is the original price minus the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid:
$2000 - $1800 = $200

The percentage discount is the discount amount divided by the original price, multiplied by 100:

- Jenny bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas.
- So, the total number of bananas is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.
- The cost of 40 bananas at $0.80 each is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny bought 10 bunches.
- The cost of 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to see how much Jenny saved:
- The cost of buying individually is $32.
- The cost of buying in bunches is $30.
- The savings is \(32 - 30 = 2\) dollars.

So, Jenny saved $2 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To solve this problem, let's figure out how much fence each person gets. We know that together they have 100 feet of fence, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of fence. Then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of fence. Together, they have 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to figure out how much it grows each year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, we divide 8 inches by 4 years to find the growth per year:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, we know the crocodile grows 2 inches every year. To find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the yearly growth by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.
3. **BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.
4. **MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars.
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars (since BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, \( 500 / 2 = 250 \)).
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \) dollars.

Finally, we add up all the earnings:
- Total earnings: \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many bales the farmer makes and how many the truck picks up over the 6-hour day.

1. First, calculate how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours:
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - In 6 hours, the farmer makes \(5 \times 6 = 30\) bales.

2. Next, calculate how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours:
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - In 6 hours, the truck picks up \(3 \times 6 = 18\) bales.

3. Finally, find out how many bales are left in the field by subtracting the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made:
   - Bales left = Bales made - Bales picked up
   - Bales left = 30 - 18 = 12

So, the number of bales left in the field is 12.

"First, let's figure out how many classes John has in a day. He has 6 normal classes plus 2 extra classes, which makes 8 classes a day.

Each class is 40 minutes long, so for 8 classes, he spends:
8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes a day

He goes to class for 5 days a week, so in a week, he spends:
320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Now, he spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday for extra learning. So, the extra time he spends on each of these days is:
1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes/day

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra time is:
100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes

Adding this to his regular weekly class time, the total time he spends learning in a week is:
1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours

"First, we need to find out how high Nathan drops the ball from. Since each story is 24 feet high and he drops it from the third floor, the ball is dropped from a height of 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height. So, the height after the first bounce is 72 feet * 2/3 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball again bounces to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is 48 feet * 2/3 = 32 feet.

   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches}

   - Total apples sold: 2000
   - Apples per bag: 10
   - Number of bags sold: 2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

2. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag.
   - Price per bag: $5
   - Total earnings: 200 bags × $5 = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors had already taken half of what was left after the T-Rex. So, the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the velociraptors.
3. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.
4. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is the other half that was left after the T-Rex ate.
5. Therefore, the triceratops originally had 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

"First, let's figure out the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet

Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet

Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
40 square feet * 2 = 80 square feet

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon:
240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost is:
12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas, 3 of which are shaken.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken, 8 unshaken).
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas (2 shaken, 6 unshaken).

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. We need to find the probability that the soda is one of the 2 shaken ones out of the 8 remaining sodas.

The probability is calculated as:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"First, let's figure out how many days Billy is working. March has 31 days, and April 1st to April 19th is 19 days. So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is:

31 days (March) + 19 days (April) = 50 days

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he takes:

20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days off

This means he works:

50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours each day, so he helps:

2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Over 40 days, he helps:

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each one and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length = 300 feet
- Speed = 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length = 240 feet
- Speed = 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

"First, let's figure out how much time Bobby spends on breaks and lunch each day.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. So, the total time for breaks and lunch per day is:
30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (first break) + 15 minutes (second break) = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means Bobby spends 1 hour on breaks and lunch each day.

Now, we need to find out how much time this adds up to over 5 days:
1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

Micah's miles = 28

Now, we know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"First, let's figure out what Sheila's balance was after she returned the $15.00 item. She originally charged $85.00, so:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price is $20.00, so the discount is:

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

So, the frying pan costs:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price is $30.00, so the discount is:

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( J \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).
4. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. So, \( \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \).

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Current annual salary = $100,000.
   - Annual retirement need = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount Lauren needs for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement need = Annual retirement need * 20 years = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. **Calculate how much Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

4. **Determine how many years Lauren needs to save $800,000:**
   - Number of years needed = Total retirement need / Annual savings = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

To solve for \( P \), we convert 40% to a decimal:

\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600 students.

Next, we need to find the number of girls. Since 40% are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can calculate the number of girls as follows:

2. **Number of days in June:** 30 days.
3. **Miles Soledad plans to hike each day:** 125 miles twice a day, which is 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Now, let's calculate the total miles she will hike if she sticks to her plan:
- **Total miles hiked in 30 days:** 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles, but with her current plan, she will only hike 7,500 miles. Let's find out how many more miles she needs to hike in total:
- **Additional miles needed:** 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the additional miles by the number of days:
- **Additional miles per day:** 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day.

So, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles each day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance John drives to visit his parents.
2. Double that distance to account for the round trip.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits he makes in a month.

First, we know that John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph to get to his parents' place. To find the one-way distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

This is the one-way distance. For a round trip, he drives this distance twice:

   - Each worker works for 10 hours.

   So, the total number of toys produced by the first 2 workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
   \]

   The total number of toys produced by the next 2 workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
   \]

   Adding these together gives the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:
   \[
   120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of toys needed to complete the order:**
   - The order is for 400 toys.
   - By the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys to complete the order.

   Therefore, the number of toys produced by all 5 workers together:
   \[
   400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The first 4 workers produced 200 toys.
   - The total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 380 toys.

   So, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:
   \[
   380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
   \]

4. **Determine the rate of production for the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker worked for 10 hours.
   - The number of toys produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours is 180 toys.

   Therefore, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
   \]

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"First, let's find out how much each of Elijah's dogs weighs.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
1/4 * 60 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
1/2 * 60 = 30 pounds

Now, let's add up the weights of all the dogs:
Kory’s dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds

60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.
2. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.
3. Kris received these 16 stickers from Luis, who gave him half of what he had.
4. If 16 stickers is half of what Luis had, then Luis originally had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
5. Luis received these 32 stickers from Seth, who gave him half of what he had.
6. If 32 stickers is half of what Seth had, then Seth originally had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

"First, let's find out how many M&M's John has in total.

1. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces.
2. John buys 3 large bags, so the total weight is \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \) ounces.
3. Each ounce contains 30 M&M's, so the total number of M&M's is \( 30 \times 30 = 900 \) M&M's.

Now, John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag.

4. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: \( 900 \div 10 = 90 \).

So, John can make 90 small bags.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate what half the circumference of the earth is. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

"To solve this, let's think step by step.

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. At that time, Liam’s age was twice Vince’s age. So, if we let Vince’s age two years ago be \( V \), then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago.
6. To find Vince’s current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9
   \]

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs Painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

3. **Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Since the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, Arnold and Madeline together painted:
     \[
     56 - 30 = 26 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Eggs Painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted 30 eggs:
     \[
     S + (S + 12) = 30
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2S + 12 = 30
     \]
   - Subtract 12 from both sides:
     \[
     2S = 18
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     S = 9
     \]
   - So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted:
     \[
     9 + 12 = 21 \text{ eggs}
     \]

5. **How Many More Eggs Did Camden Paint Than Arnold?**
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     21 - 13 = 8
     \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"First, let's figure out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons.

200 crayons ÷ 8 crayons per group = 25 groups

Since each group goes into a box, there will be 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes × 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons × 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight to pounds:

400 ounces ÷ 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

"First, we need to find out how much of the tree John can use to make logs. Since he can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet:

80 feet * 0.80 = 64 feet

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of usable tree:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks he gets from each log. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we need to find out how much money he makes by selling each plank for $1.2:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

So, John makes $96.

"First, let's figure out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out their combined salary. Valerie and her brother together earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long Grandma spends walking on the sidewalk and then add that to the time she spends on the beach.

First, let's find out how fast Grandma walks on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

So, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we know that on the sidewalk, she walks at twice the speed. So, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means she walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

50 minutes"
"First, let's figure out how much Jane has already saved. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

$4 per week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60.

$60 total - $32 already saved = $28 more needed

Since she saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take by dividing the amount she still needs by the amount she saves each week.

$28 more needed / $4 per week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Finally, we add the 3 blue birds from the last tree:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, we add all these numbers together:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

"First, let's figure out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 24. So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let's set up the equation:
\[ \text{Initial marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:
\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles from the 36 he has, we need to subtract 10 from 36:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug so that the mixture in Donny's water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- The temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug as 33 degrees.
- The amount of water from the first mug as 4 ounces.
- The amount of water from the second mug as 1 ounce.

The formula to find the final temperature of a mixture is:
\[ \text{Final Temperature} = \frac{\text{Total Heat}}{\text{Total Mass}} \]

The total heat is the sum of the heat from each part of the mixture:
\[ \text{Total Heat} = (4 \text{ ounces} \times 33 \text{ degrees}) + (1 \text{ ounce} \times T \text{ degrees}) \]

The total mass is the sum of the masses of the water:
\[ \text{Total Mass} = 4 \text{ ounces} + 1 \text{ ounce} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the final temperature \( F \) is:
\[ F = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \]

We know that Donny can drink the water if the final temperature is at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find out the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the number of cows added is \(20 \times 7 = 140\) cows.
- Over three weeks, the number of cows added is \(140 \times 3 = 420\) cows.

Next, let's calculate the increase in chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- In one week, the number of chickens added is \(10 \times 7 = 70\) chickens.
- Over three weeks, the number of chickens added is \(70 \times 3 = 210\) chickens.

Now, let's add these increases to the initial numbers:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Cows added: 420
- Total cows: \(50 + 420 = 470\)

- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Chickens added: 210
- Total chickens: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, let's find the total number of animals:
- Total animals: \(470 + 230 = 700\)

"First, let's find out how much 4 packs of bagels cost without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs would cost:

4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

Now, let's calculate the discount. A 10% discount on $40.00 is:

10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

So, the total cost after the discount is:

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Russell ordered 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels is:

4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel

So, the cost of each single bagel is $1.00.

$1.00"
"First, let's figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are used to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down:

3 less than 6 potatoes is:
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes

1 less than 3 scoops is:
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply and divide:

\( x = (3 \times 18) / 2 \)
\( x = 54 / 2 \)
\( x = 27 \)

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, let's add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens 240 eggs make:

240 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 60. We can find out how many blue jelly beans there are by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total:

60 total jelly beans - 17 green jelly beans - 34 red jelly beans = 9 blue jelly beans

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 9.

"First, let's find out how many men and women were on the bus initially.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 people (5 men + 9 women), 5 are men and 9 are women.

The total number of passengers is 84. To find out how many groups of 14 are in 84, we divide 84 by 14:
\[ 84 \div 14 = 6 \]

This means there are 6 groups of 14 people on the bus. Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women: \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number included in the bouquets.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers were sold individually:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- So, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's find out how many bouquets were sold:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- So, the number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers are in the bouquets:
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- So, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

Now, let's add the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 (individual) + 84 (in bouquets) = 97.

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
- Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day \(\times\) 3 days = 291.

"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to complete all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the time for each size of picture scene separately and then add them together.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - Number of days for large-sized scenes = 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - Number of days for medium-sized scenes = 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - Number of days for small-sized scenes = 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days.

Now, we add the days for each type of scene:
- Total days = 9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days.

5 weekdays * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekends. There are 2 weekend days, and he eats 5 carrots each day:
2 weekend days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots

Now, we add the carrots from weekdays and weekends together:
20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekends) = 30 carrots

So, Mason eats 30 carrots a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and then add it to the length of the first song.

1. The first song is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes:
   \[
   5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. Add this 3 minutes to the original 5 minutes to get the length of the second song:
   \[
   5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. Now, add the lengths of both songs to get the total time of the cassette:
   \[
   5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes}
   \]

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find out how much profit Linus made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the devices bought.
3. Determine the total revenue from selling all the devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
- Linus buys a mobile device for $20.
- He sells it for twice the amount of the original price.
- Selling price = 2 * $20 = $40.

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the devices bought.
- He bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday.
- Total number of devices = 2 + 4 = 6.
- Total cost = 6 * $20 = $120.

Step 3: Determine the total revenue from selling all the devices.
- Selling price of one device = $40.
- Total revenue = 6 * $40 = $240.

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $120 = $120.

So, the profit Linus earned is $120.

"First, let's figure out how tall Ned is. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, we know Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can find Carl's height:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot
Carl's height = 6 feet

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, the length of Carl's cane is:

Cane length = Carl's height / 2
Cane length = 6 feet / 2
Cane length = 3 feet

3 feet"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many bottles of carrot juice are needed to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

1. First, determine how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand:
   - Since 1 bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles (100% / 20%) are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand.

2. Next, calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:
   - 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles

3. Now, we know that Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. We need to find out how many more bottles are needed to meet the total demand:
   - 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles

So, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"First, let's figure out how many of the octuplets are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets).

3/4 of them are dressed in purple:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \]
So, 6 babies are dressed in purple.

1/4 of them are dressed in blue:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]
So, 2 babies are dressed in blue.

Next, we need to find out how many of these babies are wearing bows.

All the blue-wearers wear bows:
\[ 2 \text{ blue-wearers} \]

1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
So, 2 purple-wearers wear bows.

Now, let's find the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue-wearers)} + 2 \text{ (purple-wearers)} = 4 \]

We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. There are 2 purple-wearers out of 4 total bow-wearers.

The percentage is:

"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports last week: 5168
Reports on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports on Thursday and Friday: 2136

First, add the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract this total from the total number of reports received last week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"First, let's figure out how much land Abraham sold each time and how much he earned from each sale.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.
3. After selling half, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.
4. He then sold 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.
5. After this sale, he has 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.
6. He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, which is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from the sales:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $60

Total earnings: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140

"First, let's figure out how many eggs each person found:

- Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total found from the total hidden:
36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"First, let's figure out how many apartments are in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add that to 400.

60% of 400 is:
0.60 * 400 = 240

So the third complex has:
400 + 240 = 640 apartments

Now, let's add up all the apartments:
200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, and he gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. So, the total amount he makes per week is:
1040 apartments * 3 collections/week * $0.40/collection = $1248

So, John makes $1248 in a week.

"To find out how many fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year:

1. **5-year-old tree:** 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree:** 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree:** 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree:** 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces first.
5. **9-year-old tree:** 0 fruits (it doesn't produce any fruit)
6. **10-year-old tree:** 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces:
- 8-year-old tree: 1000 fruits (10-year-old) - 200 fruits = 800 fruits

Next, we add up the fruits produced each year from age 5 to age 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the length of the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Combine like terms:
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]
8. Now, we know the blue rope is 5 centimeters long. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   4B = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we know that after giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money.

3. Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
4. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
5. According to the problem, \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).

Let's solve for \( x \):

\[
15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
\]

\[
15 - x = 12
\]

\[
x = 15 - 12
\]

\[
x = 3
\]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister.

6. Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister.

\[
5 - 3 = 2

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The mural is half yellow, so the other half is made up of red, white, and purple.
2. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of it (which is yellow) would be 12 / 2 = 6 pints.
3. The remaining half of the mural, which is 6 pints, is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
4. To find out how much paint was used for each of these colors, we divide the 6 pints by 3 (since there are three colors).

So, 6 pints / 3 colors = 2 pints per color.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

- On Wednesday, she saw double the number from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) clouds.
- On Thursday, she saw double the number from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) clouds.
- On Friday, she saw double the number from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) clouds.

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find out how many pods you get for $1, we divide the number of pods by the cost:

"First, let's figure out how many $20 bills Thomas gets when he withdraws $1000. 

$1000 divided by $20 per bill equals 50 bills.

Thomas loses 10 of these bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Each of these 20 bills is worth $20, so he has 20 * $20 = $400.

Thomas then triples his money, so he has $400 * 3 = $1200.

He converts all his money into $5 bills. $1200 divided by $5 per bill equals 240 bills.

"First, let's figure out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. He started with a 5-inch piece and used 45% of it.

45% of 5 inches is:
0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. Now, we need to find out how much chalk is left:
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

The teacher plans to use 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the amount of chalk left after each day:

- **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
  20% of 2.75 inches is:
  0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches
  Chalk left after Tuesday:

- **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
  20% of 2.20 inches is:
  0.20 * 2.20 = 0.44 inches
  Chalk left after Wednesday:
  2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches

After Wednesday, the chalk is less than 2 inches, so the teacher will have to recycle it.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 more days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"Let's use some algebra to solve this problem. We'll call Colin's current age \( C \) and Wendy's current age \( W \).

From the first part of the problem, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write this as:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second part, in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write this as:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( W \):

   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, the net change in bandages is \( -38 + 50 = 12 \) bandages added.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - No new packs were ordered.
   - So, the net change in bandages is \( -28 \).

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - So, the net change in bandages is \( 100 - 25 = 75 \) bandages added.

4. **Total Change Over Three Days:**
   - First day: \( +12 \)
   - Second day: \( -28 \)
   - Third day: \( +75 \)
   - Total change: \( 12 - 28 + 75 = 59 \) bandages added.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - If they ended with 78 bandages and the total change over the three days was +59 bandages, then they must have started with:
   \[
   78 - 59 = 19
   \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"First, we need to find out how many inches of hair were cut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is:

10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, it would be:

2 inches * $30/inch = $60

Now, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40:

$60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100

So, the total cost for May's haircut and color is $100.

"First, let's calculate how much Jen earns from her hourly work. She works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. So, the total hours she works in a week is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings from her hourly rate:
\[ 45 \text{ hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly work for April are:
\[ \$67.5/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270 \]

Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she had complete attendance for all 4 weeks, her total additional earnings are:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40 \]

Now, we add her earnings from her hourly work and her additional attendance bonus:
\[ \$270 + \$40 = \$310 \]

So, Jen will receive:
\[ \$310 \]

"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each task and then add them all up.

1. Laundry: $3.00 for doing it once.
2. Cleaning his room: $1.50 for doing it once.
3. Taking the trash out: $0.75 each time, and he did it twice.
4. Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 each time, and he did it 6 times.

Now, let's calculate:

- Laundry: $3.00
- Cleaning his room: $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Adding these amounts together:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishes) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in the two-week period.

"First, we need to find out how much blood one shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we multiply 40 gallons by 3.

40 gallons * 3 = 120 gallons

This means one shark has 120 gallons of blood. Now, to find out how much blood ten sharks have, we multiply the amount of blood one shark has by 10.

120 gallons * 10 = 1200 gallons

So, ten sharks have 1200 gallons of blood.

"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. This means \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (in the morning) entered the restaurant. This means \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together to get the total number of people:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320.

"To find out how many pens Alain has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
2. Each pack has 5 pens, so the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

3. She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
   \]

4. Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

5. To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens:

"First, let's figure out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so each bottle costs:
\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the cognac:
\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's figure out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day.

He planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted:
20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so:
20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30 White Oak trees in total.

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more on the second day than the first day. So, the additional number of Lodgepole Pine trees is:
40 * 1/4 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees.

Therefore, on the second day, he planted:
40 (first day) + 10 (additional) = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days:
30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees in total.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so:
   24 - 4 = 20 gallons left.
3. On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so:
   20 - 7 = 13 gallons left.
4. On the third day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so:
   13 - 5 = 8 gallons left.
5. On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, including Fred, so there are 4 people in total (Fred + 3 guests).

To find out how much root beer each person gets, we divide the remaining 8 gallons by 4 people:
8 ÷ 4 = 2 gallons per person.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's call the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge \( x \).
2. According to the problem, ""four times the number of coffee mugs"" is \( 4x \).
3. ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" is \( 4x + 8 \).
4. We know that this equals 40, so we can write the equation: 
   \[
   4x + 8 = 40
   \]
5. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation. First, subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
   \]
   \[
   4x = 32
   \]
6. Next, divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4}

   \[
   x = 8
   \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after taking out the ones with red stripes:

66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish remaining

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we can calculate this by:

44 fish * 5/11 = 20 fish with blue stripes

Now, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total:

22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each. So, that's 2 palettes * 4 colors/palette = 8 colors from the palettes.
2. She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each. So, that's 3 sets * 6 colors/set = 18 colors from the makeup sets.
3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she loses 4 colors. Now, she has 8 - 4 = 4 colors left from the palettes.
4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 colors used.
5. After using up 3 colors from one makeup set, she has 6 - 3 = 3 colors left from that set.
6. The other two makeup sets are still full, so she has 2 sets * 6 colors/set = 12 colors left from those sets.
7. Adding up all the colors she has left: 4 colors from the palette + 3 colors from the partially used makeup set + 12 colors from the other two makeup sets = 4 + 3 + 12 = 19 colors.

"To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of the house.
2. Calculate the height of the first floor.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof.

First, we know that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is. So, the total height of the house is:
\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, the height of the first floor is thrice Mattison's height:
\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 240 inches.

We know the distances for the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these distances together gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance the first three dogs walk from the total distance for all four dogs:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier at each setting and then add these amounts together.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**

"First, let's figure out the volume of the jar. The jar is a rectangular prism, so we can find its volume by multiplying the length, width, and height.

The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches by 15 inches, so:
\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to account for the packing efficiency. The jelly beans only fill about 80% of the jar's volume. So, the effective volume filled by the jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we need to find out how many jelly beans can fit in this effective volume. Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so:

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans he estimates is:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his estimate from the true number:

"To find out how much fabric Luke needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total width of all the windows combined. Since each window is 35 inches wide and there are five windows, we multiply 35 inches by 5:

35 inches/window × 5 windows = 175 inches

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, so we multiply the total width by 2:

175 inches × 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

"To figure out the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after that.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. For the remaining 20 minutes (36 minutes - 16 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute.
   - 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the costs of both parts together:
- $4.00 (first 16 minutes) + $4.00 (remaining 20 minutes) = $8.00

So, the total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of treats needed:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people.
   - Each person gets 2 treats.
   - Total treats needed = 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
   - Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - Number of brownies = \( 3c - 2 \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - Total treats = Number of cupcakes + Number of brownies
   - \( c + (3c - 2) = 10 \)

4. **Solve the equation:**
   - Combine like terms: \( c + 3c - 2 = 10 \)
   - Simplify: \( 4c - 2 = 10 \)
   - Add 2 to both sides: \( 4c = 12 \)
   - Divide by 4: \( c = 3 \)

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's find out how much the manicure and pedicure cost together with the 20% discount.

The cost of a manicure is $35, and the cost of a pedicure is $40. So, the total cost without any discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount on the total cost of both services. To find the discount amount:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and she has 10 fingers. The cost per nail is $3, so the total cost for the nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Now, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay:
\[ 90 \]

90"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to add up all the issues from each of the magazines she subscribes to.

1. The first 3 magazines send 12 issues each year. So, for 3 magazines, that's \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues.
2. The next magazine sends 6 issues a year.
3. The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues.

Now, we add all these issues together:
\[36 + 6 + 24 = 66\]

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year.

66"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to the number of paintings Samantha has, we get the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \( 27 + 12 = 39 \)
   So, Shelley has 39 paintings.
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has, we get the number of paintings Kim has:
   \( 39 - 8 = 31 \)
   So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"First, let's figure out the price of the toy in December after the 80% increase.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by 80% of $40. 

80% of $40 is calculated as:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the price in December was:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price went down by half of $72.

50% of $72 is:
\[ 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price in January after the discount was:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

"First, let's figure out how much Charlie makes from the standard lessons. He has 4 lessons at $80 each:
4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. The standard rate is $80, and he reduces it by 25% for veterans:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

So, the reduced rate for veterans is:
$80 - $20 = $60

Now, let's calculate how much he makes from the 2 veteran lessons:
2 lessons * $60/lesson = $120

Finally, we add the money from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons to find the total amount he makes for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

"First, let's figure out how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of the 60 apples.

2/5 of 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate them.

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. 25% is the same as 1/4.

1/4 of 36 = 36 / 4 = 9 apples

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he has left to sell.

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

27 * 3 = 81

Walter received $81 from selling the apples.

3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]
4. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes eaten by Madeline, the grapes used by her brother, and the grapes used by their mother:

"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of teachers who were sick = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers who were sick + Number of substitute teachers

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9

Now, let's do the math:

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to add up the costs of the ingredients he uses each week and then multiply by the number of weeks in a year.

1. The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box.
2. The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
3. The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, so it's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up the weekly cost:
- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Gruyere cheese: $6.00

Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52:
- Yearly cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

"To figure out how many bookcases Elly needs, let's first find out how many books each bookcase can hold.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books each, so together they can hold:
   \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
   \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
   \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

4. Now, let's add up all the books each bookcase can hold:
   \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books per bookcase.

5. Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:

"First, let's figure out how much Rose spent on the eggs. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

So, the total cost is:
5 dozens * $2.40 per dozen = $12.00

Next, we need to find out how many eggs she has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs:
5 dozens * 12 eggs per dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how much she will sell the eggs for. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. So, for 60 eggs:
60 eggs / 3 eggs per $1 = 20 units of $1

So, she will make:
20 * $1 = $20.00

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total sales:
$20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is:

First, let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is 116. So, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 116 + 4 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = \frac{120}{6} \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, the number of strawberry cubes is 20.

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made each day.
2. Determine the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

First, we know that Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

So, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Each doughnut sells for $2, so the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost for one week and then multiply it by 5.

First, let's calculate the cost for one week:
- Cost for blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Cost for pants: 2 pants * $8.00 per pair of pants = $16.00
- Cost for skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Now, add these costs together to get the total cost for one week:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Next, multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the total cost for 5 weeks:
$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Conor saw 50 people.

2. **Second Day:**
   - 20 more people than the first day.
   - Number of people = 50 + 20 = 70.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Twice the number of people as the second day.
   - Number of people = 2 * 70 = 140.

4. **Rest of the Week (4 days):**
   - Average number of people each day = 60.
   - Total number of people for 4 days = 60 * 4 = 240.

5. **Total for the Week:**
   - Add the number of people from each day.
   - Total = 50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week).

Now, let's add these numbers together:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop. So, \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial rate pop. So, \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds. So, \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels pop.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:

\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"To figure out how many lemons Tim needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Lemons for the pool party:**
   - Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice for 1 gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - So, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 cups of juice, he needs \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) lemons.

2. **Lemons for Allen's extra gallon:**
   - Allen wants a gallon that is twice as tart.
   - This means Allen's gallon needs 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 2 cups of juice, he needs \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) lemons.

3. **Total lemons needed:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Elvis traveled in each direction and then find the net distance from his starting point.

1. **Distance traveled west:**
   - Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

2. **Distance traveled east:**
   - Elvis drives east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

3. **Net distance from the starting point:**
   - Since Elvis first traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance.
   - Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and then apply it to the boat's value.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by 30%.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by another 30%.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by 20%.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

"To find out how much profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and subtract the total cost to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the cost of making one jar:**
   - Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
   - Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
   - Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
   - Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Revenue from selling 10 jars = 10 * $50 = $500

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

So, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60.

"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them all together.

- Quarters: 32 quarters × $0.25 = $8.00
- Dimes: 95 dimes × $0.10 = $9.50
- Nickels: 120 nickels × $0.05 = $6.00
- Pennies: 750 pennies × $0.01 = $7.50

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

"First, let's add up all the money Janet spent at the mall.

She spent:
- $3.50 on ice cream
- $7.50 on a movie ticket for herself
- $7.50 on a movie ticket for her sister
- $8.50 on a bracelet

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$3.50 + $7.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40.00. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she was given:

$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

   - Oatmeal: 9
   - Chocolate chip: 4
   - Sugar: 5

2. **Eating 3 cookies (one of each flavor):**
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. **Eating 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:**
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. **Giving 2 sugar cookies to his friends:**
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. **Baking 4 of each flavor for dinner:**
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies: 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

"To find out how much money Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the total amount he would get from selling half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy.

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers, so half of his collection is:
12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers

For the first half (6 toy soldiers) at $5 each:
6 * $5 = $30

For the second half (6 toy soldiers) at $7 each:
6 * $7 = $42

Now, we add the amounts from both halves to find the total:
$30 + $42 = $72

Matthew would earn $72.

"First, let's figure out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so:

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

When Nate gets back, he fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks it will take:

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Norman High School enrolls 4000 students. Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. So, we calculate the enrollment at Butler High School by multiplying 4000 by 3/4:

\[ 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Test Tubes:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes.
   - Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
   - Half of 16 is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.

2. **Petri Dishes:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
   - Two more than 14 is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

3. **Beakers:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
   - However, he lost some beakers on the way to the lab bench.

4. **Total Items on the Lab Bench:**
   - The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor actually placed on the lab bench:
- Test tubes: 8
- Petri dishes: 16
- Beakers: Let's call the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench \( x \).

The equation for the total number of items is:
\[ 8 + 16 + x = 29 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 24 + x = 29 \]
\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor placed 5 beakers on the lab bench. Since he was supposed to place 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he will use for the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

First, we calculate the total number of legs for the 4 tables:
4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs

Next, we calculate the total number of screws needed for the legs:
16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws

James has 40 screws, so we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws:
40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

So, James will have 8 screws left over.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - So, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - If Aaron's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \), then Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{16 \text{ minutes}} \).
   - To run 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost per reservation:**
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each, so the cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
   - Each reservation also orders a $5 bottle of wine.
   - Therefore, the total cost per reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue per night:**
   - The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - So, the total revenue per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total revenue per week is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

So, the restaurant makes 180 dollars a week.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the total cost.

1. Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:
   Total cost = $80

2. Calculate the profit:
   Profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

3. Calculate the total selling price:
   Total selling price = Total cost + Profit = $80 + $20 = $100

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"First, let's figure out how old Dora is now. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, that means she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since John was 19 when James was born, and James is now 18, John is now 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is now 37, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in one hour.
- So, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in one hour.
- So, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"First, let's figure out how much Mark paid for the radiator at the junk shop. The radiator originally costs $400, and he gets it for 80% off. 

80% of $400 is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the discount is $320. Therefore, the price he pays for the radiator is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve this, let's use a bit of math. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Let's say the number of chickens is \( C \) and the number of cows is \( K \).

We have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. The total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to find \( K \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting \( K \) back into the first equation:
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
