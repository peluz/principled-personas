"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue bolts)} + 1 \text{ (white bolt)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3.

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the increased value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   - 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

2. Calculate the new value of the house:
   - Original value + Increase in value = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including repairs:
   - Purchase price + Repair costs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

4. Calculate the profit:
   - Selling price - Total cost = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total feed needed per day is:
   \( 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \)

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
   \( 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \)

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   The total feed needed for the day is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given. Therefore, the feed needed for the final meal is:
   \( 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \)

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses where every second glass is 60% of the price, we can break down the purchase into pairs of glasses. Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.

1. The cost of one full-price glass is $5.
2. The cost of one discounted glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

For each pair of glasses, the total cost is:
$5 (full price) + $3 (discounted price) = $8.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, he is buying 8 pairs of glasses. The total cost for 8 pairs is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John travels away from home and then subtract the distance he travels back towards home.

1. **Distance traveled away from home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Distance traveled back towards home:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours have already passed), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total distance traveled back towards home:**
   - Total distance back = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Final distance from home:**
   - Distance from home = Distance away - Distance back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads. The reduction in downloads is:
30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads.

Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Income**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the annual income from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.
4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit per year is the annual income minus the annual expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]
5. **Break-even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net annual profit:
   \[
   \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before selling at the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

2. Before selling at the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners, which is after selling 2 more to the red house. Therefore, before selling to the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

3. The 12 vacuum cleaners represent the amount left after selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If 12 is two-thirds of the original amount (since she sold a third at the green house), then the original amount is 12 * (3/2) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Solving for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Initially, there are 10 liters of orange drink.
   - The amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

2. **Account for the spill:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled.
   - The amount of water in the spilled 1 liter of orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \) liters.
   - The remaining amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - There are 15 liters of pineapple drink.
   - The amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

4. **Sum the amounts of water:**
   - The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters.

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age of Raymond when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old and that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's current age is:

31 (Samantha's age) + 6 (years older than Samantha) = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago this was, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

37 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when his son was born) = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount. If \( P \) is the original price, then the price Kyle paid is 75% of \( P \) (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

The equation is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples:

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- The 5 packs of milk cost 5 * $3 = $15.
- The 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total cost of these items:

$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:

$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of other items) = $17.

Now, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she ordered:

$17 / $8.50 (cost per box of pizza) = 2.

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings consumed in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will eat:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons needed is:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the cost of the boots, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $33 * 2 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of the boots:

Cost of boots = Cost of two pairs of high heels + $5
Cost of boots = $99 + $5
Cost of boots = $104

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. Let's denote Darrell's age by \(7x\) and Allen's age by \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solve for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine what each friend guessed and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 80 \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S \)), we can find the number of gold coins (\( G \)):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find out how many more points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So in the second 20 minutes, he scores 1 point more than the first 20 minutes, which is:

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. After selling them, he uses the money to buy video games and has $5 left. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine if he sold all of them or not.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the lego sets:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games he bought:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is:
$160 (cost of video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

Since the total amount of money John made from selling the lego sets is $195 and he spent $165, this means he did indeed sell all of his lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
0

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
- Total distance = 60 miles
- Total time = 6 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Average speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on the information given about her skipping speed.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = Running speed \(\times\) Time running = \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = Walking speed \(\times\) Time walking = \(1.5 \times 4 = 6\) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We know that one serving of chips is 250 calories and the 300g bag has 5 servings. Therefore, each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since 250 calories are in 60g of chips, we can calculate the number of grams that contain 200 calories:

(200 calories / 250 calories) * 60g = 48g

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies and the total revenue from selling the candles.

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Add the number of Post-it notes she had remaining to the number she used.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she originally had in her purse from the total to find out how many were in the package.

Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes at work. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package is:

220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243 Post-it notes

She originally had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

243 (total after purchase) - 80 (original) = 163 Post-it notes

The number of Post-it notes in the package is 163.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on all ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he covers is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes him to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, let's calculate how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 pounds * (2 toys/pound) = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity is:

5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

1245 pounds / 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

Since the number of boxes must be a whole number, and we cannot load a fraction of a box, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is 83.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level, starting from the top and working our way down.

Given that the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Number of levels = 4

Average square footage per level = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive over these years, starting from the point where she has completed five years of service.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7200

Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she is eligible for a 10% increase in her salary.

3. **Salary Increase after 5 years**: 10% of $7200 = 0.10 * $7200 = $720
4. **New Annual Salary after 5 years**: $7200 + $720 = $7920

Now, we need to calculate the salary for each of the next three years, with a 10% increase each year.

5. **Salary after 6 years**:
   - 10% of $7920 = 0.10 * $7920 = $792
   - New Annual Salary = $7920 + $792 = $8712

6. **Salary after 7 years**:
   - 10% of $8712 = 0.10 * $8712 = $871.20
   - New Annual Salary = $8712 + $871.20 = $9583.20

7. **Salary after 8 years**:
   - 10% of $9583.20 = 0.10 * $9583.20 = $958.32
   - New Annual Salary = $9583.20 + $958.32 = $10541.52

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $10541.52.

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adult dinosaurs.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the child dinosaurs.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we know that each adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad. There are 20 adult dinosaurs, so the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is:
\[ 10 \text{ lbs/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, each child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, which is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]
There are 5 child dinosaurs, so the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is:
\[ 5 \text{ lbs/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of potato salad needed:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total area of the fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice, her fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. The area (total number of roll-ups) she had is:
2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups

For Marcell, his fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. The area (total number of roll-ups) he had is:
3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups

To find the average, we add the total number of roll-ups they both had and divide by 2 (since there are two people):

(48 + 42) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

So, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups each.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore is:

"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lessons in a day.
2. Multiply the total number of lessons by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons/day} \]

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day} \]

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.

2. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.
   - Let \( d \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50d \).

3. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - \( d = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she has and then the total selling price based on the 50% price increase. Finally, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Number of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10
   - Cost per 2 x 4 x 10 board: $10
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $10 = $100

2. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Number of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5
   - Cost per 4 x 4 x 10 board: $16
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $16 = $80

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the lumber:**
   - Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180

4. **Calculate the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards after a 50% increase:**
   - Original price per 2 x 4 x 10 board: $10
   - New price per 2 x 4 x 10 board: $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15
   - Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150

5. **Calculate the selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards after a 50% increase:**
   - Original price per 4 x 4 x 10 board: $16
   - New price per 4 x 4 x 10 board: $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24
   - Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $24 = $120

6. **Calculate the total selling price of all the lumber:**
   - Total selling price: $150 + $120 = $270

7. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
   - Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

Sasha makes a profit of $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of both combined.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. To find out how many parts each unit represents, we divide the total amount by the total number of parts in the ratio:

120 / 20 = 6

This means each part in the ratio represents 6 units. Since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts, the amount of sugar used is:

7 parts * 6 units/part = 42 units

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \)
   - \( 40,000 = 1.30L \)
   - \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \)
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately)

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \)
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40,000 + 16,000 \)
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 56,000 \)

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's salary.
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \)
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \)
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 43,076.92 \) (approximately)

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 \)

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation for \( W \):
  \[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, we substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we have \( Q \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples per harvest
- John has 10 hectares of land.
- Each hectare yields 100 pineapples.
- Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is \(10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}\).

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, the number of harvests in a year is \(12 \text{ months/year} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year}\).

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
- Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.
- \(1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}\).

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is 4000.

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees at each stage:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 that many bees return. This means \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first group leave the hive. This means \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that and hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This includes the 30 bees that left initially and the 60 bees that left later, minus the 15 bees that had already returned.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is \( 30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \).

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received to this amount.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.

The total cost for 1 adult and 1 child ticket is:
$12 (adult ticket) + $10 (child ticket) = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
$22 (total cost of tickets) + $8 (change) = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference in their travel times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance to home in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance to home in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home by dividing the distance by their speed.

Steve's time to get home:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time to get home:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in their travel times is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar).

500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to find the original number of fries in the pack.

1. We start with the 5 fries left after the ants took one. Before the ants took the fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
2. The raccoon took two thirds of the fries, leaving one third. If 6 fries represent one third, then the total before the raccoon took the fries was 6 * 3 = 18 fries.
3. The three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.
4. The seagull ate half the amount that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Before the seagull ate, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.
5. Dave ate 14 fries initially, so before he ate, there were 34 + 14 = 48 fries.

Therefore, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on each type of day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. Therefore, the total number of hours on these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours on these days is:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all the days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 4 \text{ hours/week} = 13 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[
13 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 208 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
208

   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Next, we sum the total lengths in inches and convert the result to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Total length in inches: \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches
- Total length in feet: \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first need to calculate the total distance each person runs.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back-and-forth run is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).

\[ \text{Blake's total distance} = 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, and then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).

\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 1 \times 200 + 34 \times 80 \]
\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

**Difference in Distance:**
To find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to calculate their total expenses and then isolate the cost of the lemons.

First, let's find out how many gallons of lemonade they sold. Since they make 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50, the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons they sold to make a profit of $25. Let \( x \) be the number of gallons sold. The total revenue from selling \( x \) gallons is:
\[ 10x \]

The cost to make \( x \) gallons is the sum of the cost of lemons and sugar:
\[ 3x \text{ (lemons)} + 2x \text{ (sugar)} = 5x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 10x - 5x = 5x \]

We know the profit is $25, so:
\[ 5x = 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

They sold 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons.

   - Therefore, Monic has \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) crabs.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**
   - Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
   - Therefore, Rani has \( 36 + 10 = 46 \) crabs.

3. **Calculate the total number of crabs:**
   - Bo has 40 crabs.
   - Monic has 36 crabs.
   - Rani has 46 crabs.
   - The total number of crabs is \( 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \).

"Lloyd earned $10 per hour for tutoring. In the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, and in the second week, he tutored for 8 hours. To find out how much he earned in the first two weeks, we calculate the earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Total earnings for the first two weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. Since the total number of students who voted is 80, we calculate the winner's votes as follows:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes

Let's do the calculations:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80 = 60

Loser's votes = 80 - 60 = 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20.

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( C \).

From the information given:
\[ 200 = 5C \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ C = 40 \]

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

\[ R = 4C \]
\[ R = 4 \times 40 \]
\[ R = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, we need to determine Jan's age two years ago:
- Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Next, we use the information that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time:
- Half of Jan's age two years ago = 28 / 2 = 14 years.
- Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5 = 19 years.

Now, we find Mark's current age:
- Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years.

Finally, we use the information that Jean is two years older than Mark:
- Jean's age = 21 + 2 = 23 years.

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Team A (Well-Rounded Team):**
- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team A = 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

**Team B (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
- Time taken by Team A = 220 seconds
- Time taken by Team B = 222 seconds
- Difference = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds

The faster team (Team A) will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - The difference in probabilities is \( 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \).

4. **Expressing the difference as a percentage:**
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we calculate the percentage increase:
   - Percentage increase = \( \frac{0.5 - 0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \).

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.
2. The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
3. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
4. There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits:

- Hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw.
- Rabbits: 20 pieces of straw.

So, the total straw used for hamsters and rabbits is:
50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70 pieces of straw.

Now, subtract this from the total straw to find out how much straw is used for the rats:
160 (total) - 70 (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total straw for rats by the straw per rat:
90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is:
15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 2\% = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Buying the Bags**: The trader buys each bag for $20.
2. **Transportation Cost**: It costs $2 to transport each bag.
3. **Total Cost per Bag**: The total cost for the trader per bag is $20 (purchase) + $2 (transport) = $22.
4. **Selling Price per Bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. **Profit per Bag**: The profit per bag is $30 (selling price) - $22 (total cost) = $8.
6. **Total Profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400.

To find the number of bags sold, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Total Profit} = \text{Profit per Bag} \times \text{Number of Bags} \]

Rearranging to solve for the number of bags:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Profit per Bag}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: $20.25 for 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees Tom plants each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees.

Step 1: Net number of trees planted each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees he adds each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees will be:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Final number of trees
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. According to the information provided:

- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of one pencil} + \text{Cost of one eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times the initial number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Therefore, in the third month, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards she has:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards collected in the first month: 60

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and then calculate the earnings from each publisher.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, we get:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to achieve an average of 93:
- The formula for the average is: (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)
- We want the average of the five highest scores to be 93.
- Therefore, the total score needed for the five highest scores is: 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we need to find the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 92, 100, 86
- Sum of these scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total score of the five highest scores will be:
- 367 + \( x \)

We set up the equation:
- 367 + \( x \) = 465

Solving for \( x \):
- \( x \) = 465 - 367
- \( x \) = 98

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance he rode in the first four weeks and the distance he rode in the following three weeks.

1. For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides \(125 \times 4 = 500\) kilometers.

2. For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides \(120 \times 3 = 360\) kilometers.

Adding the distances from both periods gives us the total distance:
- Total distance = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40 grams/chocolate bar = 1000 grams

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs:
40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20 grams/candied apple = 1600 grams

Now, we can find the total weight of the bag by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000 grams (chocolate bars) + 1600 grams (candied apples) = 2600 grams

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
2 pairs * $20/pair = $40

The total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs is:
$70 - $10 = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
4 times * $5/time = $20

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings, she has:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30

The remaining amount she needs after babysitting is:
$60 (needed) - $30 (savings + babysitting) = $30

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $30, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$30 / $4/lawn = 7.5

Since Sara cannot mow a half lawn, she will need to mow the lawn 8 times to have enough money.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The number of eggs produced by the red chickens each day is \( 3R \) (since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day), and the number of eggs produced by the white chickens each day is \( 5W \) (since each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day).

The total number of eggs collected each day is the sum of the eggs from the red and white chickens:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter for \( d \) and Gary's walking speed for \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers (first day) + 50 more customers = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days: 500 customers.
4. Subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total to find the number of customers on the third day: 500 customers (total) - 100 customers (first day) - 150 customers (second day).

Now, let's do the calculation:

500 - 100 - 150 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 16 \) gallons (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons), and the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after paying $165 a month for 12 months, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, including the 10% interest.

1. Calculate the total amount owed:
   - Principal amount: $2000
   - Interest: 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200
   - Total amount owed: $2000 + $200 = $2200

2. Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months:
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Total payments: $165 * 12 = $1980

3. Calculate the remaining balance:
   - Remaining balance: Total amount owed - Total payments
   - Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total of 251 points.

1. Naomi's score is given as 68 points.
2. Yuri's score is 10 more than half of Naomi's score. Half of Naomi's score is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \), so Yuri's score is \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. Brianna's score is 17 points more than Naomi's score, so Brianna's score is \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we add up the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from 251:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:

"First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is 33%.

"First, let's calculate how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited the farm. There were 120 baby watermelons, and 30% of them were ready:

120 watermelons * 30% = 120 * 0.30 = 36 watermelons

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home. This leaves:

120 watermelons - 36 watermelons = 84 watermelons

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:

84 watermelons * 3/4 = 84 * 0.75 = 63 watermelons

So, she harvested 63 more watermelons. The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is the remaining 1/4 of the 84 watermelons:

84 watermelons * 1/4 = 84 * 0.25 = 21 watermelons

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen he made.

"To find out how many boys are in the third class, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students in the school.
2. Determine the total number of girls in the school.
3. Use the information about the number of girls in the first and second classes to find the number of girls in the third class.
4. Subtract the number of girls in the third class from the total number of students in the third class to find the number of boys.

Step 1: Total number of students in the school
- Each class has 20 students.
- There are 3 classes.
- Total students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students.

Step 2: Total number of girls in the school
- The school is 50% girls.
- Total girls = 50% of 60 students = 0.50 * 60 = 30 girls.

Step 3: Number of girls in the third class
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.
- Total girls in the first and second classes = 15 + 12 = 27 girls.
- Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first and second classes = 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Step 4: Number of boys in the third class
- Each class has 20 students.
- Number of boys in the third class = Total students in the third class - Girls in the third class = 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cougars killed today:**
   - Last night, Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Today, he killed three fewer cougars than last night.
   - Therefore, the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

2. **Determine the number of wolves killed today:**
   - Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Since he killed 12 cougars today, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of animals killed today:**
   - Wolves killed today: 36
   - Cougars killed today: 12
   - Total animals killed today: \( 36 + 12 = 48 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of animals killed over both days:**
   - Wolves killed last night: 10
   - Cougars killed last night: 15
   - Total animals killed last night: \( 10 + 15 = 25 \)
   - Total animals killed over both days: \( 25 + 48 = 73 \)

"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys any additional cows. There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows, so the total number of cows initially is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. The number of new cows added to each stall is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, each stall will have the original 20 cows plus the 2 new cows:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows per stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and dollar bill and then sum them up.

1. The value of the pennies: 100 pennies * $0.01/penny = $1.00
2. The value of the nickels: 40 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $2.00
3. The value of the dimes: 20 dimes * $0.10/dime = $2.00
4. The value of the dollar bills: 40 dollar bills * $1.00/dollar bill = $40.00

Now, we add up all the values:
$1.00 (pennies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $45.00

Therefore, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

The total weight of the tree is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, the weight of the wood they ate is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Jamal has:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - Therefore, Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.

2. **Determine the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Therefore, Jamal has \( 44 + 4 = 48 \) bananas.

3. **Determine the number of bananas Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Therefore, Andrea has \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) bananas.

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.
   - Total number of fruits = \( 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \).

Now, let's add these together:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount needed for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies:**
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the amount needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:**
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Sum the amounts of flour needed for both days:**
   - Total flour needed = 6 cups (for 36 cookies) + 5 cups (for 30 cookies) = 11 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

1. **Selling Price of the House**: $350,000
2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]
3. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the House**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:** 20 minutes.
2. **Time to heat oil from 300 to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.

   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:** 
   - \( 20 \) minutes (to 300 degrees) + \( 28 \) minutes (to 400 degrees) = \( 48 \) minutes.

4. **Time to cook the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil.
   - Time to cook the chicken = \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) minutes.

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - Total time = Time to heat the oil + Time to cook the chicken
   - Total time = \( 48 \) minutes + \( 43 \) minutes = \( 91 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:

There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so the number of guests is:
12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests

Adding the team members, the guests, and the coaches, the total number of people is:
12 team members + 24 guests + 3 coaches = 39 people

Each pizza serves 3 people, so the number of pizzas needed is:
39 people / 3 people/pizza = 13 pizzas

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:
13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
2. The total length of the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.
3. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.
4. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of sterling silver beads needed is \( \frac{17}{0.25} = 68 \).

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

So, in the second week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stories they wrote over the two weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives the total number of stories:
\(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\)

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first calculate the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of medals given out.
   - Therefore, \( 39 = \frac{T}{10} \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to find \( T \):
   - \( T = 39 \times 10 = 390 \).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. Each of the 4 adults gets 6 chocolate bars:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

These 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To determine how much Susan earns, we first need to calculate the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

The total time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours. Converting this to minutes gives us:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Since Susan takes a half-hour pause, the actual working time is:
180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval:
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point. Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point. Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to add up the number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

Crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates
Crates sold on Tuesday: 15 crates
Crates sold on Wednesday: 12 crates
Crates sold on Thursday: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18

Now, let's calculate the total:

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates, so we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates he was off:

Crates off target = 120 - 65

Now, let's calculate the difference:

Crates off target = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in each of the three years and then calculate the earnings for the second year.

1. We know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
   \( 250 - 50 = 200 \) books.

2. We also know that she sold 45 books in the current year (the third year).

3. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the third year, the number of books sold in the first year is:
   \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \) books.

4. To find out how many books were sold in the second year, we subtract the number of books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold:
   \( 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \) books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning:
   \[

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We can calculate this by dividing the total weight Sandy wants to lose by her weekly weight loss:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of people at the party:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **Number of people who left after an hour:**
   - 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10 people left.

3. **Number of people remaining after an hour:**
   - Total remaining: 40 - 10 = 30 people

4. **Number of men who stayed:**
   - 22 men stayed.

5. **Number of women who stayed:**
   - Total remaining people: 30
   - Men who stayed: 22
   - Women who stayed: 30 - 22 = 8

So, the number of women left is 8.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the following equation to find out how many pencils are in each box:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with the number of pencils per box:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \text{ pencils} \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We can do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, the number of ice cubes required is:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube adds 12 milliliters of water to the coffee, so the total amount of water added by the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Water added by ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream. Therefore, the total amount of liquid added to the coffee is:

\[ \text{Total liquid added} = 60 \text{ milliliters (from ice cubes)} + 15 \text{ milliliters (from cream)} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the exchange rate and the total number of new records received.

The exchange rate is 2 old records for 1 new record. If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in by multiplying the number of new records by the exchange rate.

\[ \text{Number of old records} = \text{Number of new records} \times \text{Exchange rate} \]
\[ \text{Number of old records} = 7 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of old records} = 14 \]

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Monthly salary of each junior programmer = $2000.
   - Total monthly salary for junior programmers = 40 \times 2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   - Number of senior programmers = 60.
   - Monthly salary of each senior programmer = $2400.
   - Total monthly salary for senior programmers = 60 \times 2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:**
   - Total monthly salary for all programmers = Total monthly salary for junior programmers + Total monthly salary for senior programmers.
   - Total monthly salary for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. Therefore, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
   24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has:
   22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 to his friends, he buys:
   2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.
5. Adding the lollipops he bought to the ones he has left, he now has:
   8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
6. He eats 3 more that night, so he has:
   36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has:
   33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge required:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, it will take:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = $4 off

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 rewards, and the coupon they applied took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

Coupon discount = 2 * $4 = $8 off

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to this shopping trip:

Total discount = Rewards + Coupon discount = $4 + $8 = $12 off

The amount the customer paid on this shopping trip is the total spent minus the total discount:

Amount paid = $43 - $12 = $31

"To determine which job offers Nick a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for each job after accounting for the respective taxes.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax on net income: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \).
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60

6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears that Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
6 * $2 = $12

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
5 * $1 = $5

The total cost of the toys is:
$12 + $5 = $17

Dean initially had $28 and spent $17, so he has:
$28 - $17 = $11

After his mother gives him an extra $10, Dean has:
$11 + $10 = $21

So, Dean has $21 left.

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person (Morgan) to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we can see how many people can be accommodated within the $90 budget.

1. **Cost for one person:**
   - Mini-golf: $5
   - Arcade tokens: $5
   - Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

   Total cost for one person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

2. **Total budget: $90**

3. **Number of people (including Morgan) that can be accommodated:**
   - Total budget / Cost per person = $90 / $30 = 3

Since the total number of people is 3, and this includes Morgan, the number of friends she can invite is:

3 - 1 = 2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost of gumballs = 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00.

2. **Determine the amount of change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, so the total change he had before buying gumballs is twice the cost of the gumballs.
   - Total change before buying gumballs = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

3. **Determine how much money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy started with $10 and had $4.00 left as change.
   - Money spent on candy = $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.50 per pound.
   - Number of pounds of candy = $6.00 / $1.50 per pound = 4 pounds.

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can write this as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day, and finally determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second and then to the third is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles, which is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   - The total distance for one trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   - The train makes 3 trips a day, so the total distance in one day is 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.

4. Determine how many days the train can operate before needing service:
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so the number of days before service is 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then the total amount to be repaid, which includes both the principal and the interest. After that, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 152.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50

"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, which means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles can be expressed as:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing her song, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities:
Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100

Substituting the values we have:
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100

Now, let's calculate the percentage:
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pizza has 12 slices in total.
2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since 1/3 of 12 is 4, Bill gets 4 slices.
3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since 1/4 of 12 is 3, Mark gets 3 slices.
4. Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away and eaten:

- Slices given to Bill: 4
- Slices given to Mark: 3
- Slices eaten by Jenny: 2

Total slices given away and eaten: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9

Finally, we subtract the total slices given away and eaten from the total number of slices:

12 - 9 = 3

So, the number of slices left is 3.

"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, let's break down the information given:

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders. So, the number of millipedes is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).
3. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ 90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168 \]

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - If Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]

2. Convert the daily energy consumption from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, the daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours is:
     \[
     \frac{7200 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 7.2 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. Calculate the energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day:
   - If Mel uses the air conditioner for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours), the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
     \]
   - Convert this to kilowatt-hours:
     \[
     \frac{2700 \text{ watt-hours}}{1000} = 2.7 \text{ kWh}
     \]

4. Determine the daily energy savings:
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original daily consumption and the reduced daily consumption:
     \[
     7.2 \text{ kWh} - 2.7 \text{ kWh} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
     \]

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - The total energy savings over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Therefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are a total of 4 zebras. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 \div 4 = 22\]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Adding the cost of the meat and the cheese together gives us the total cost:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **After Buying More Cannolis:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **New Quantity of Corns:**
   - Allan now has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis, the number of corns is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total of corns and cannolis is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 160.

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the payments for May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Pay rate per hour: $15

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 160 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$2400 \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times \$2400/\text{employee} = \$96,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees who continued working in June:
\[ 40 \times \frac{3}{4} = 30 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 160 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$2400 \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times \$2400/\text{employee} = \$72,000 \]

**Step 4: Add the payments for May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months.**

"To determine how much money Sally has left after her purchases, let's break down the costs of the items she bought.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of All Items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
   - Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- 80% of $1200 is $1200 * 0.80 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. We know that 1% of Marcy's candles are expected to explode because they are 99% guaranteed not to explode. Out of these exploding candles, 5% also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, we calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:

1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we calculate the number of these exploding candles that also smell like wet dog:

5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

Therefore, 25 candles are expected to both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and set up equations to find the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
   - From the average trees: Let's denote this as \( x \) apples.

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both sisters:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 \)
   - Combined total: \( (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500 \)

Now, let's set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
\]

Combine the known values:

\[
150 + x = 500
\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = 500 - 150
\]

\[
x = 350
\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- Each camel has 1 head and 2 humps.
- Each dromedary has 1 head and 1 hump.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. For the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day:
   \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \)

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days:
   \( 30\% \times 800 \, \text{km} = 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \)

3. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is:
   \( 0 \, \text{km} \)

4. During the second week (7 days), he made 300 kilometers every day:
   \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \)

Now, we sum all the distances:
\( 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \)

   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after a $4 savings, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after a $2 savings, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented for the trip.

- The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.
- The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.
- The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.

Adding these capacities together gives us the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

240 employees (from buses) + 180 employees (from minibusses) + 150 employees (from minivans) = 570 employees.

"Lillian has built 3 bird feeders and bought 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, so the 3 store-bought feeders attract:
3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds

The homemade feeders attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. Therefore, the 3 homemade feeders attract:
3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding the birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade feeders gives us the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see each day:
60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4:
   - 25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup = $4 + $1 = $5
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel:
   - Half of $4 = $4 / 2 = $2

Now, we add the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of soup + Cost of bagel + Cost of cake
- Total cost = $5 + $4 + $2 = $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needed to make from selling his cards and then figure out how many cards he sold to achieve this.

1. The cost of the amusement park ticket is $100.
2. Kenny also wants to have $50 in spending cash.
3. Therefore, the total amount of money Kenny needs is $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.
4. Kenny sells each card for $1.5.
5. To find out how many cards he needs to sell to make $150, we divide the total amount needed by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.
6. Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, which means he sells 2/3 of his cards.
7. If 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection, then the total number of cards he started with can be found by dividing 100 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 100 by 3/2: 100 * (3/2) = 150 cards.

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially preparing for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means he prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs and the other 18 guests to have one hotdog.
3. The total number of hotdogs prepared is:
   - 18 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 36 hotdogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hotdog each = 18 hotdogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

4. However, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
5. The total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests, each having 2 hotdogs, is:
   - 40 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 80 hotdogs

6. The caterer only had 54 hotdogs prepared, so the number of hotdogs short is:
   - 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs

7. Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs to be satisfied, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
   - 26 hotdogs / 2 hotdogs per guest = 13 guests

Therefore, 13 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, Charlotte's order was $132.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater and then calculate how much earlier she should leave compared to Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time difference:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) (since his travel time is 4 minutes).
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet, since the area is given in square feet and we need the perimeter in feet. There are 3 feet in a yard.

The length of the room in feet is:
3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We know the area of the room is 360 square feet, and the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. We can use this information to find the width of the room.

Let's denote the width of the room as \( w \) feet. The area of the room is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times w \]

Solving for \( w \):
\[ w = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} \]
\[ w = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width of the room, we can calculate the perimeter. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - If there are 15 red cards, then the number of green cards is:
     \[
     15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24
     \]

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is:
     \[
     15 + 24 = 39
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - The total number of cards is the sum of the red, green, and yellow cards.
   - Therefore, the total number of cards is:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 39 = 78
     \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100

Now we calculate the percentage:

Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100 = 35%

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. After that, we can divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are necessary.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:

- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips:

- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, the weekly earnings from cans are 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, the weekly earnings from bottles are 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Now, let's add the weekly earnings from cans and bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

Finally, to find the earnings for a four-week month, we multiply the total weekly earnings by 4:
- Monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

First, we determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we calculate Toni's plants as follows:

60% of 10 plants = 0.60 * 10 = 6 plants

So, Toni has 10 plants + 6 plants = 16 plants.

Next, we find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 plants - 7 plants = 9 plants

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are the ones she gives to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 45 \) cents.
- Convert 45 cents to dollars: \( 45 \) cents = \( 0.45 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 50 \) cents.
- Convert 50 cents to dollars: \( 50 \) cents = \( 0.50 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is \( 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \) dollar.
- The final cost for Kelly is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, calculate how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Kelly paid \( 9 \) dollars.
- Becky paid \( 8 \) dollars.
- The difference is \( 9 - 8 = 1 \) dollar.

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:

     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost of 2 packs:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Cost Per Razor:**
   - The total cost after the discount and coupon is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

6. **Convert to Cents:**
   - \$0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount and coupon is 25 cents.

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we first need to calculate the total height in inches and then convert it to feet.

The height of each of the 9 cheerleaders is 64 inches, and the height of the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches. The pyramid is structured as follows:

- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom layer
- 3 cheerleaders on the second layer
- 2 cheerleaders on the third layer
- 1 cheerleader at the top

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders, each standing on the shoulders of the ones below them. Since the shortest girl (60 inches) is at the top, the height of the pyramid is:

\[ 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 60 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \]
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \]
\[ 1 \times 60 = 60 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \]

Now, convert the total height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ 636 \div 12 = 53 \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old in four years.
4. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from her age in four years: 42 - 4 = 38.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we can calculate the cost of his rides separately for the morning and the afternoon, and then add them together.

For the morning rides:
- He drives twice a day, once in the morning, for 14 days.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- The total cost for the morning rides is 14 days * $6/ride = $84.

For the afternoon rides:
- He drives once in the afternoon, for 14 days.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- The total cost for the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2/ride = $28.

Now, we add the total cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides to get the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = $84 + $28 = $112.

Therefore, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"To determine how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges they have.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box:
5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

The total number of oranges they have together is:
50 oranges (Ashley) + 70 oranges (Brianne) = 120 oranges

Each Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so the number of pies they can make is:
120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of insects each person found with variables:
- Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
- Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
2. \( D = \frac{B}{2} \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)
3. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (Together they found 43 insects)

First, substitute \( D \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ L = \frac{B}{2} + 7 \]

Now, substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the third equation:
\[ \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) + \frac{B}{2} + B = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ B = 18 \]

Now, find \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Finally, find \( L \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To add these fractions, we can convert 1/2 to 2/4 to have a common denominator:

1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

This means they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together. Now, we need to find out what 3/4 of 364 yards is:

3/4 * 364 = (3 * 364) / 4

Now we calculate the result:

(3 * 364) / 4 = 1092 / 4 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to determine the width of the rug and then use that to find the length of the couch.

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the width of the rug is:
   \[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 \]
   \[ \text{Width of the rug} = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so the length of the couch is:
   \[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 \]
   \[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

The length of the couch is 18 feet.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then determine the best combination within his budget.

1. **Cost and Yield of Each Type of Wood:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - To maximize the number of sticks, Frederick should buy the type of wood that gives the most sticks per dollar.
   - The cost per stick for a 2 x 4 piece of wood is \( \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \) dollars per stick.
   - The cost per stick for a 2 x 8 piece of wood is \( \frac{6}{400} = 0.015 \) dollars per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides more sticks per dollar, it is the cheaper option in terms of cost per stick.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Sticks:**
   - With $24, Frederick can buy \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces of 2 x 8 wood.
   - Each piece of 2 x 8 wood yields 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will yield \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day for her bus trips is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of a weekly bus pass is $20.00. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ 2.00 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(20 / 2 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Combined, the farm and the zoo have:

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th, and then calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 lbs.

1. **Calculate the total number of days:**
   - From January 1 to July 19, we have:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days (up to July 19th)
   - Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   - To lose 1 pound, Andy needs to burn 3500 calories.
   - To lose 30 pounds, Andy needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   - Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total number of days
   - Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Therefore, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
   - Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)
   - Combined total: \(42 + 130 = 172\)

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can break down the information given:

- For 5 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, we calculate the total hours for each part and then sum them up:

- 5 weeks at 4 hours each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours
- 2 weeks at 5 hours each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours
- 1 week at 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

Adding these together gives the total number of hours:

\(20 + 10 + 6 = 36\) hours

**First Stop:**
- 8 passengers get off the bus.
- 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) people.

After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 passengers get off the bus.
- 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) people get on the bus.

After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors:

Total cost of all items = Cost of computer + Cost of 2 monitors + Cost of printer
$2,400 = $1,100 + Cost of 2 monitors + $700

Now, we can solve for the cost of 2 monitors:

Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The cost of one monitor is $300.

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This can be expressed as: \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \).

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month, we first need to add up the number of vlogs she has already made over the first three weeks:

18 vlogs (first week) + 21 vlogs (second week) + 15 vlogs (third week) = 54 vlogs

Now, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal:

72 vlogs (monthly goal) - 54 vlogs (already made) = 18 vlogs

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"To calculate how much you end up paying, we first need to determine the total amount including the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 is calculated as:
0.20 * $50 = $10

So, the total amount including the tip is:
$50 + $10 = $60

Since you are splitting the check evenly with your wife, you each pay half of the original bill, which is:
$50 / 2 = $25

However, you are also paying the entire tip, which is $10. Therefore, the total amount you pay is:
$25 (half of the bill) + $10 (tip) = $35

So, you end up paying $35.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   The first half of April has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.

3. **Set up the savings for each half:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   Since he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, he will save \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   The total savings for the month should be $1125.
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   Since \( x = 25 \), the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

- In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
- In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

   - When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
   - When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.
   - Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this time gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun moves relative to the ground, not just relative to the pyramid. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid, and it does so for 10 hours. Therefore, the sun will have moved 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees from the tip of the pyramid.

Since the pyramid itself is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add this angle to the angle the sun has moved to find the total angle from the ground to the sun.

Total angle from the ground to the sun = angle of the pyramid + angle the sun has moved

"To determine how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

Finally, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

"To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the payments as follows:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half of $1.00, which is $0.50, for each tooth. So for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the amounts:

First tooth: $5.00
Next three teeth: $3.00
Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

The total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

"To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since there are 4 days and he spends an equal amount each day, we divide the total amount of money by 7 (the number of days in a week) to find out how much he spends each day:

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Since he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures for 4 days, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each wooden action figure is $5, so the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of money left for the rest of the week:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Peter will spend this remaining amount on plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday, which is 3 days. Since he spends an equal amount each day, the amount spent each day on plastic action figures is:

\[ \frac{30}{3} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

The cost of each plastic action figure is $2, so the number of plastic action figures he buys each day is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ plastic action figures per day} \]

Since he buys plastic action figures for 3 days, the total number of plastic action figures he buys is:

\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Finally, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops and the number of roses Ford can supply.

1. Calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per week:
   - First shop: 20 roses
   - Second shop: 15 roses
   - Third shop: 30 roses
   Total per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

2. Calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per month (assuming 4 weeks in a month):
   Total per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses

3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford can supply per month:
   - Ford grows 40 roses per week
   Total per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses

4. Determine the shortage:
   Shortage = Total required per month - Total supplied per month
   Shortage = 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

The percentage error is calculated as:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature.

Now, we need to find the temperature setting that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature.

Let \( x \) be the temperature setting. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \).

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]

\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost Pete if he buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

First, the cost of 2 boxes without the discount is:
2 boxes * $100.00/box = $200.00

Now, apply the 10% discount:
10% of $200.00 = 0.10 * $200.00 = $20.00

So, the total cost with the discount is:
$200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Next, the total number of contacts from 2 boxes is:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

Finally, the cost per contact is:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00/contact

Since each contact is a single use, the cost per pair (which is 2 contacts) is:
$1.00/contact * 2 contacts/pair = $2.00/pair

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed of the plane can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly production} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly production} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates they can make together in 12 hours. We do this by multiplying their hourly production by 12:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total production in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Marissa's total production in 12 hours} = 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total production of Ruiz and Marissa to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total production} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is $8 * 2 = $16.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is $16 * 4 = $64.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent over the three days:

Total spent = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday
Total spent = $8 + $16 + $64
Total spent = $88

Howard originally had $100, so the amount left after spending is:

Amount left = Original amount - Total spent
Amount left = $100 - $88
Amount left = $12

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the sales into two parts and then sum the earnings from each part.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour were 15 cups * $0.50/cup = $7.50.
- Over four hours, the total earnings were 4 hours * $7.50/hour = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour were 10 cups * $0.60/cup = $6.00.
- Over two hours, the total earnings were 2 hours * $6.00/hour = $12.00.

Adding the earnings from both parts:
- Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo based on Jeremy's monthly driving distance and then determine how many months (and subsequently years) it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity.

1. First, calculate the number of rotations per mile:
   - 725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

2. Calculate the total number of rotations per month:
   - 362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

3. Determine how many months it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity:
   - 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months

4. Convert months to years:
   - 72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, it will provide twice as many washes with 1 pump per wash:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per wash. The bottle costs $24.00, and it will now provide 240 washes:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since each wash now uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash, which is $0.10. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is:

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42 on the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants:
   - 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter.
   - Therefore, 4 dozen croissants will require 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter.

2. Calculate the total amount of butter needed for a week (7 days):
   - If 4 dozen croissants require 1 pound of butter per day, then for 7 days, he will need 7 * 1 = 7 pounds of butter.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Funding: $100,000

2. **Subsequent months:**
   - Total research duration: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for additional months: 50% more than the initial monthly funding
   - Initial monthly funding: $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month
   - Additional monthly funding: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month
   - Total funding for additional months: 45 months * $30,000 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Initial 5 months: $100,000
   - Additional 45 months: $1,350,000
   - Total cost: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat eaten by each player who consumed meat. 

- The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
- The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
- The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:

6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads Gary does in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of loads Gary does in a year.
3. Calculate the total amount of water used in a year.
4. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

Step 1: Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does 2 loads per week.

Step 2: There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads in a year is:
2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Step 3: Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:
104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Step 4: A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:
2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

1. The aquarium cost $10.00.
2. Two bags of rocks at $2.50 each would be 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
3. Three pieces of coral at $2.00 each would be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
4. Twenty fish at $0.50 each would be 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
5. The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the number of cars towed in the first three days and the number of cars towed in the remaining four days of the week.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
   \( 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \)

2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than the 10 cars pulled on the first three days. So, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
   \( 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \)
   Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
   \( 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \)

Adding the totals from both parts of the week gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

Step 2: Determine the cost to acquire the cars.
The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car.
Cost to acquire one car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
Total cost to acquire 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Total sales - Total cost to acquire the cars
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Step 4: Calculate James's commission.
James's commission is 10% of the profit.
James's commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

James made $17,500.

1. Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright.
2. Determine the number of women who can stay upright.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright.
- 25% of 100 riders can stay upright.
- 25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Step 2: Determine the number of women who can stay upright.
- 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women.
- 60% of 25 = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women.

Step 3: Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.
- Number of men = Total number of riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright.
- Number of men = 25 - 15 = 10 men.

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, the price of a gold jewel is:
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance of the gap by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per class over $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. The cost per class if he attends all classes is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

If Manny misses a class, the number of classes he attends decreases, and the cost per class he attends increases. We need to find the point where the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny misses as \( x \). The number of classes he attends is then \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class he attends is \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the largest \( x \) such that \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \).

Solving the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

1. Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
2. Julie processes customers twice as fast as Jewel, so Julie processes \(50 \times 2 = 100\) customers daily.
3. Together, they process \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers daily.
4. Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. Therefore, Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. If we let \(L\) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie's distance can be expressed as \(L + 3\).

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Solving for \(L\):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of one apple is:
$5.20 / 4 apples = $1.30 per apple

The cost of one orange is:
$3.30 / 3 oranges = $1.10 per orange

Now, we can calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples * $1.30 per apple = $6.50
5 oranges * $1.10 per orange = $5.50

The total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he plans to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular hole can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot, then the total time \( T \) can be calculated as:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of all the additional features he has chosen.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500
6. Towing package: The cost of the towing package is not specified, so we will assume it is included in the base price or is free, as it is not mentioned as an additional cost.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2S + 3 \]

We are also told that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To solve for \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we will convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is:
600 inches (final height) - 240 inches (initial height) = 360 inches

Now, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find the number of days:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one for each dog, so he now has 12 (current) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs the 3 toys for the dogs that are gone, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys, which is exactly the number of dogs he now has.

Therefore, James needs a total of 21 toys.

"To determine how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps of the investments made by Dylan and Frances, and then calculate the remaining amount for Skyler.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   - Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount.
   - Total amount = $1200
   - Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \)

2. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
   - Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   - Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.
   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \)

4. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Remaining amount after Dylan's investment - Frances's investment
   - Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240

5. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances have invested.
   - Skyler's investment = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment is $240.

"To determine how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Together, they have:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first calculate the total weight of the group and then compare it to the maximum load capacity.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults (including Jack):
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

2. Compare the total weight to the maximum load capacity of the elevator:
   - Maximum load = 700 kg.
   - Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has based on the information given.

1. Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
3. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
4. We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( C + 7 = 68 \).

From the equation \( C + 7 = 68 \), we can solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 68 - 7 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

5. Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies, which is:
\[ 61 + 12 = 73 \]

So, Max has 73 cookies.

6. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has:
\[ 73 + 23 = 96 \]

So, Summer has 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the cookies each person has:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's add these together:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length of the dress before adding the lace trim is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

She then adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length of the dress \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.

We know the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris took to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the time he took to mow the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, and then sum these times.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, he would take half of 60 minutes.
   - Time in turtle mode = 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, he would take half of 40 minutes.
   - Time in rabbit mode = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time to mow the lawn = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
   - Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R \), we can find \( T \):

\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"John has a total of 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting this to minutes, we have 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

The total time John needs to complete his homework is the sum of the time for each subject:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Adding these together, we get 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

The total cost for the candies can be found by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:

$3.20 (total cost) - $2.00 (cost of lollipops) = $1.20 (cost of candies)

Since he bought four candies, the cost per candy is:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. The cost for 10 lollipops is:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00

The cost for 10 candies is:

10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives us the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

$4.00 (cost of 10 lollipops) + $3.00 (cost of 10 candies) = $7.00

Therefore, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which means Neil saves an additional 2/5 * 20 coins each month.

Let's calculate how many more coins Neil saves each month:
2/5 * 20 = 8 coins

So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins each month.

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong's total savings in ten years:
20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins

Neil's total savings in ten years:
28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins

Now, we add Rong's and Neil's total savings to find the combined total:
2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins

Therefore, Rong and Neil have a total of 5760 coins after ten years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
   - The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the capacity of Gordy's truck and then use the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck capacity.

Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,800 pounds

The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. So, we can find Gary's truck capacity by subtracting the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:
Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's truck capacity + Gordy's truck capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 pounds - (4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds)

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

Given that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
3 dumplings/female + 1 dumpling = 4 dumplings

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Let's denote the speed of the turtle as \( S \) (in feet per second). Since the cat is 5 times faster, we can write the relationship as:
\[ 15 \text{ feet/second} = 5 \times S \]

To find \( S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ S = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

2. Determine the total amount of money still needed to reach the goal:
   \[
   \text{Amount Needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount Raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Additional Hours Needed} = \frac{\text{Amount Needed}}{\text{Hourly Rate}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours needed to find the total hours required:
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the firefighters have to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from the total percentage of water used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]
\[ 0.32 \times 100\% = 32\% \]

So, 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

Next, to find the percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial percentage from the total percentage used by the city:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

     \]

3. **Total Production in 48 Hours:**
   - For chocolate ice cream:
     \[
     50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
     \]
   - For vanilla ice cream:
     \[
     12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
     \]

4. **Total Quarts of Ice Cream in 48 Hours:**
   - Adding the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:

"To find Marcus' total bill, we first calculate the cost of each type of item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to find the final total:

Final total = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students in both classes**: 80 students.
2. **Number of students in each class**: Since the two classes have the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

3. **Percentage of girls in each class**: 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

4. **Number of boys in each class**: Since the total number of students in each class is 40, and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys in each class is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:**
   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so in two months, there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weeks.
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - Therefore, in 8 weeks, there are \(8 \times 5 = 40\) weekdays and \(8 \times 2 = 16\) weekend days.

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays:**
   - Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
   - The total number of chairs rented on weekdays is \(60 \times 40 = 2400\) chairs.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekends:**

"To solve this problem, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading 90% of Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27).

3. **Trading 50% of Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).

4. **Trading the Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 60 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 63 small buttons.

6. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 92 buttons.

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit he picked and then sum these costs.

1. **Peaches**: 
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums**: 
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Apricots**: 
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$18.00 \)

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
\[ \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00 \]

Therefore, Winston spent a total of $38.00 on fruit.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for a total of 6 hours minus the 1.5 hours they spent hiking, which is 4.5 hours. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 225 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 25 miles per hour, and 5 miles per hour less than this is 20 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance to their vacation spot:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 255 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points they each earn and then find the difference.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Ava's points:
- Enemies: \( (E + 8) \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( (B + 3) \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( (T - 4) \times 30 \)

Emma's points:
- Enemies: \( E \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( B \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( T \times 30 \)

Now, let's calculate the total points for each:

Ava's total score:
\[ 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

Emma's total score:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

The difference between their scores:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ = -25 \]

The difference between their two scores is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish.
3. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
- \( x + y = 17 \) (since he bought 17 fish in total).

After adding the new fish to his pond:
- The total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
- The total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Next, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation \( x + y = 17 \):
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify, if \( x = 4 \), then:
\[ y = 5 + 2(4) \]
\[ y = 5 + 8 \]
\[ y = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish.

Now, let's check the total number of fish:
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)

Indeed, 16 is twice 8, which confirms our solution is correct.

The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract that from the total number of TVs sold.

Given that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, we can calculate the number of smart TVs sold as follows:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Similarly, one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so the number of analog TVs sold is:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature during the night.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It is 33 degrees colder during the night, so the temperature at night is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The difference between the night temperature and the freezing point is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people are split into groups of 9, we divide 90 by 9 to find the number of groups:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. So we calculate 3/5 of 10:

(3/5) * 10 = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by each of these groups is:

9 members * 2 seashells/member = 18 seashells/group

Since 6 groups brought back seashells, the total number of seashells brought back is:

6 groups * 18 seashells/group = 108 seashells

"To calculate Jamie's pay for the 11 hours she worked, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay**: Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.
   - Regular pay = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

2. **Overtime Pay**: For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at 150% of her regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime hourly rate = 150% of $20 = 1.5 * $20 = $30
   - Overtime pay = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. **Total Pay**: The total pay for the day is the sum of the regular pay and the overtime pay.
   - Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid over three months.

Step 1: Determine the total number of employees after three months.
- Initial number of employees: 200
- Number of new employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Total number of new employees hired in three months = 20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

Total number of employees after three months = Initial employees + New employees
= 200 + 60

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
- Monthly salary per employee: $4000

Total monthly salary for all employees = Number of employees * Monthly salary per employee
= 260 employees * $4000/employee
= $1,040,000

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over three months.
Total amount paid over three months = Total monthly salary * Number of months

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total collection. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate is 40%. Therefore, the fifth-graders' pass rate is 80%, which means 80 out of 100 fifth-graders passed. For 400 fifth-graders, the number who passed is 80% of 400, which is 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700
- Total students who took the test = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students who took the test:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.70 \times 100 = 70\% \]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area that can be covered.

First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag holds 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
- Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Now, we know the mosaic is 3 inches tall, so we need to find out how long it can be:
- Area of the mosaic = height * length.
- 12 square inches = 3 inches * length.
- Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea that was available at the beginning of the party. Finally, we will convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons, knowing that 1 gallon equals 4 quarts.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   \( 4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts} \)

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the sixteen students:
   \( 16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts} \)

3. Add the amounts of tea consumed by both groups of students:
   \( 6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts} \)

4. Add the 10 quarts of tea that were left over to the total amount consumed to find the total amount of tea at the beginning:
   \( 38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts} \)

5. Convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons:
   \( 48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons} \)

The total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of May and then subtract the initial number of students to find out how many additional students have joined.

1. At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.
2. At the end of the first month (January), the number of students doubles: 10 * 2 = 20 students.
3. At the end of the second month (February), the number of students doubles again: 20 * 2 = 40 students.
4. At the end of the third month (March), the number of students doubles again: 40 * 2 = 80 students.
5. At the end of the fourth month (April), the number of students doubles again: 80 * 2 = 160 students.
6. At the end of the fifth month (May), the number of students doubles again: 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, to find the number of additional students that have joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

320 (students at the end of May) - 10 (initial students) = 310 additional students.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals on the flowers Rose picked and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. First, she picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

Since she drops 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one of each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

Total petals dropped:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the total:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Since there are two worse friends, the total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \).

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Using the relationships, we can substitute the variables:
- Since \( z = f \), we can replace \( f \) with \( z \).
- Since \( s = g \), we can replace \( g \) with \( s \).
- Since \( s = 2z \), we can replace \( s \) with \( 2z \).
- Since \( o = 2s \), we can replace \( o \) with \( 2(2z) = 4z \).

Now, substitute these into the total mixture equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he remains with \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, and they each earned the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

The total time walked over the two days in hours is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day:
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\) tasks.

2. Calculate the daily earnings:
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the daily earnings are \(150 \times 1.20 = 180\) dollars.

3. Calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are \(180 \times 7 = 1260\) dollars.

So, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. Calculate the shipping cost:
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - The total shipping cost is (4 pounds * $0.35/pound) + (20 miles * $0.08/mile).

2. Calculate the refund amount:
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.
   - The refund amount is 75% of $32.

3. Calculate the net loss:
   - The net loss is the purchase price minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost.

Let's do the math:

1. Shipping cost:
   - Weight cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
   - Distance cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
   - Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

2. Refund amount:
   - 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00

3. Net loss:
   - Purchase price: $32.00
   - Refund amount: $24.00
   - Shipping cost: $3.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height that Naruto can lift a mountain, given the relative lifting capabilities of Kagiyami, Saskay, and Pompei, and the base height that Pompei can lift a mountain.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}

4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

To convert the height from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals. The speed of the kangaroos is not directly given, but we can calculate the total distance they travel.
   - Let's denote the distance across the highway as \( D \) and the speed of one kangaroo as \( S \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can be calculated using the formula \( D = S \times T \), where \( T \) is the time taken. Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, the total distance \( D \) is \( D = 3S \times 18 \).

2. **Calculate the distance:**
   - The total distance \( D \) is \( 3S \times 18 = 54S \).

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

4. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is \( 4 \times \frac{S}{2} = 2S \).
   - Using the formula \( T = \frac{D}{V} \), where \( V \) is the total speed of the turtles, we get \( T = \frac{54S}{2S} = 27 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and her mom's contribution:
\[ P + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the reduced price of the laptop:
\[ P + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ P + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 350 - 230 \]
\[ P = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

2. Therefore, the total milk production from the 3 cows is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters a day, so the additional milk needed is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters a day.
4. Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce 10 liters is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[ 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters} \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. The remaining length is:
   \[ 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters} \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. The remaining length is:
   \[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters} \]

Now, we add the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[ 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters} \]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig starts with. He has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Total socks: Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
- Total dishes: Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

Total number of socks and dishes together: 90 + 90 = 180

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total, and 5 + 8 = 13 students are good at only one of the subjects, the number of students good at both is:

20 - 13 = 7 students

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including their setup, performance, and exit, and then subtract the intermission time from the total concert time.

Each group will take:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. If we subtract the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes available for performances.

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group takes:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal.
- Time (T) = 3 years

First, convert the rate to a decimal:
\[ \text{Rate} = 0.75 \]

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]

Next, add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
975"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - There are 40 white shirts in total.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - There are 50 floral shirts in total.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Baskets:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You buy 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green baskets = 3 * $25 = $75.

2. **Cost of Red Baskets:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You buy 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total cost for red baskets before discount = 3 * $18 = $54.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Total discount for red baskets = 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for red baskets after discount = $54 - $6 = $48.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for all baskets = Cost of green baskets + Cost of red baskets after discount.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many rooms are in one-half of the total rooms at the KozyInn Motel. 

There are 90 rooms in total, so one-half of the rooms would be:

90 rooms / 2 = 45 rooms

Next, we need to calculate the total time it would take to clean 45 rooms, given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes into hours:

900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"Let's denote your age as \( x \). According to the problem:

- You are three years younger than your brother, so your brother's age is \( x + 3 \).
- You are two years older than your sister, so your sister's age is \( x - 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs. This will ensure that he has enough glue sticks for all the students and some extra.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of books each person has with variables:
- Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Next, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 each:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he bought is:
\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for:
\[ 7000 \]"
"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2:

18 glasses (boys' sales) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we know that Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. **Hair:** Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. **Manicure:** She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure as she did on her hair. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. **Pedicure:** She spent 3/4 as much on a pedicure as she did on a manicure.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the services:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575

"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the cost of the new rope.
3. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she gets from selling her old rope.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 per meter.
Total money from selling the rope = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Step 2: Determine the cost of the new rope.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah will buy a 20-meter rope.
Cost of the new rope = 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she gets from selling her old rope.
Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = $40 - $30 = $10

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can find her current age by subtracting 10 from 18:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now when this will happen as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). According to the problem, this age will be three times her current age:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Total cost for 6 packets of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

5. **Total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
   - Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

6. **Money left in Kelly’s budget:**
   - Kelly’s budget is $65.
   - Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first account for the 15-minute encore that was added to the final concert. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so without the encore, the concert itself lasted:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert was twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of a usual concert by dividing the concert length (without the encore) by 2:

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the numbers together:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones do not find space to fit in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones are left without a pair. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) petals.

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) petals.

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:
- \(40 - 25 = 15\)

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of indoor plants:
   One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, so:
   \( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \) indoor plants.

2. Calculate the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:
   \( 100 - 25 = 75 \) plants are either outdoor or flowering.

3. Calculate the number of outdoor plants:
   Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants, so:
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \) outdoor plants.

4. Calculate the number of flowering plants:
   The rest of the plants are flowering plants, so:
   \( 75 - 50 = 25 \) flowering plants.

5. Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:
   To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
   \( \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25\% \).

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

"To find the speed at which a whirligig spins, we first need to determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the speed of a whirligig is based on the speed of a thingamabob.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( T \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \) meters per second. Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

\[ 11T = 121 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ T = 11 \]

So, the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second.

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

\[ 5 \times T = 5 \times 11 = 55 \]

Thus, the speed of a whirligig is 55 meters per second.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can start by calculating the cost of the yogurt and then the total cost of the carrots.

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily food, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Since she eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payments for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

2. **Calculate the number of times Tasha mowed other lawns:**
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Determine the total payment from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6J \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total payment from all lawns:**
   - Total payment from mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \) dollars.

5. **Determine the total earnings:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.

6. **Set up the equation:**
   - Total earnings from lawns and lemonade: \( 54J + L = 80 \).

7. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - We need to find the value of \( J \). Since Joe paid $6, and we don't have any other information to determine \( J \) directly, we assume \( J = 1 \) (the simplest case).
   - If \( J = 1 \), then the total payment from mowing lawns is \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount made from lemonade sales is \( L = 80 - 54 = 26 \) dollars.

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Martha originally had \( x \) notebooks.
2. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3x \) notebooks.
3. Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 5 = 7
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 7 - 5 = 2

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either four adult bowls or eight child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, and everyone eats one bowl at a meal, we need to determine how much soup is left after dinner and how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftovers.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soup used for dinner:
- 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife)
- 2 child bowls (their two children)

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total soup used for dinner is:
- 2 adult bowls = 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls
- 2 child bowls

So, the total soup used for dinner is 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the leftover soup is:
8 - 6 = 2 child bowls

Each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total Material Required:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
3. We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
5. Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( A - 4 \):
   \[
   26 = A - 4
   \]
6. Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30

7. Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   \[
   A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide the total time by the interval at which he drinks:

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Next, subtract the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces of bologna to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Now, determine the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces thrown per yellow balloon:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is:

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first calculate the total miles driven in that month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven in a month is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for tune-ups:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he worked on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, to find the total number of hours Bruce worked over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons. 
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each received:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine the total profit raised by the class from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
- Each student sold 10 lollipops.
- There are 30 students.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
- Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150.

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is again 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days:

300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day.

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, we calculate the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance the car traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, and the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, we can express this as:

Bakery's loaves = 7 * Sam's loaves - 40

Substituting Sam's loaves with 70:

Bakery's loaves = 7 * 70 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 490 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 450

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum them up.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - For 6 copies, the total commission = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - For 10 copies, the total commission = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission from both newspapers = $3.00 (New York Times) + $12.00 (Wall Street Journal) = $15.00.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15.00.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier than usual.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time spent sleepwalking: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.
   - Subtract the time she woke up earlier: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.

Therefore, the total number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. If Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, then the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has before gifting any to Pedro:

\[ \text{Total utensils before gifting} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ \text{Measuring spoons remaining} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Measuring spoons remaining} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks (14 days).
   - Total patients admitted in 14 days = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

4. **Total Occupied Beds After 14 Days**: 
   - Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 14 days = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

5. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 14 Days**:
   - Total capacity - Total occupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of non-work emails:
   - Robyn sends 16 emails a day in total.
   - 7 of these are work emails.
   - Therefore, the number of non-work emails is \( 16 - 7 = 9 \).

2. Determine the number of emails sent to family:
   - Two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family.
   - So, the number of family emails is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \).

3. Calculate the number of emails sent to her boyfriend:
   - The remaining emails, after accounting for work and family emails, are sent to her boyfriend.
   - The number of remaining emails is \( 9 - 6 = 3 \).
   - One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend.
   - Therefore, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \).

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
   - Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes should be:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 40.
   - The total number of holes by the end of the third day is 29.
   - Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of Pokémon each person has caught with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( W \).

First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.
   - Since this is in the opposite direction, we subtract this distance from the total southerly distance.
   - Net distance after the second leg = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles.

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.
   - Add this distance to the net distance after the second leg.
   - Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles.

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, Emil's dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old when Emil turns 24.

3. **Determine the current age of Emil's dad:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Therefore, Emil's brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old when Emil turns 24.

5. **Determine the current age of Emil's brother:**
   - Since Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.
   - Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.
   - The sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50.

"To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to add up the beads given by her mother, her sister, and her friend.

1. Her mother gave her 20 beads.
2. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we add all the beads together:

20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

"To determine how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we first need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days.

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 + 12 + 6 = 21\] pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the total number of servings Joe has is:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7\] servings.

"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players are accounted for:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Now, we calculate 25% of the remaining 24 students to find out how many are cheerleaders or part of the band:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Finally, we add the number of football players to the number of cheerleaders and band members to find out the total number of students leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet**: Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space required for each plant including the space between them**: Each plant requires 1 foot of space for the plant itself and 1.5 feet of space between plants, totaling 2.5 feet per plant.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required per plant:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs**: Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants needed is:
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants**: Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is:
   \[
   27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

For one basket, the cost of the petunias is:
3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00

The cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket is:
2 sweet potato vines * $2.50 per vine = $5.00

The total cost for one basket is:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
5 baskets * $14.00 per basket = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (for sunflowers) + 15 pounds (for carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total gives us the remaining soil:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, with the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, the time required is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time for peeling and the time for sauteing.
   - Total time = 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step:

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour:
   \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees} \)

2. Then it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour:
   \( 4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees} \)

3. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour:
   \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees} \)

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Cooling on low: \( -6 \) degrees
- Cooling on high: \( -12 \) degrees
- Warming up: \( +4 \) degrees

Total temperature change:
\( -6 - 12 + 4 = -14 \) degrees

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet returns every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Determine the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Determine the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add the durations of their howls to find the total time:

\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total time into minutes:

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is the sum of their ages:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for the adults and the kids. If we let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \), then each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults, the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice that is \( 2x \), and since the whole watermelon is \( 8x \), the fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Number of sessions per week**: 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month**: Typically, we consider 4 weeks in a month for such calculations.

First, calculate the total cost per session:
- **Studio rental cost per session**: $25
- **Cost per student per session**: $1.50 * 10 students = $15
- **Total cost per session**: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, calculate the total cost per week:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the volume in gallons.
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{USD/gallon} \]

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28% of the total capacity.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \).
   - \( x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \).
   - \( x \approx 0.348 \) or 34.8%.

3. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 34.8% of the total capacity.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - \( y \times 0.59049 = 0.348 \).
   - \( y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \).
   - \( y \approx 0.589 \) or 58.9%.

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

Next, we calculate Janet's total earnings per hour, which is the sum of her wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

Now, we calculate her total earnings per week, given that she works 40 hours a week:

\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, we add up the total cost of these fruits:

$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne had initially and then calculate how many pieces each of her friends received after she kept two packs for herself.

1. Calculate the total number of pieces in the box:
   - There are 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces.
   - Total pieces = 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces.

2. Determine how many packs Anne gave away:
   - Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs.

3. Calculate the total number of pieces given away:
   - Each of the 13 packs contains 60 pieces.
   - Total pieces given away = 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces.

4. Determine how many pieces each friend received:
   - Anne has 10 friends, and she distributed 780 pieces equally among them.
   - Pieces per friend = 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend.

Each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24

   The remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
   - Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
     - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

   - Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct:
     - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

   - Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct:
     - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Calculate the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct questions = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There is a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher, and in this case, the homework will not be collected.
   - Probability of not having to turn in homework due to a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - There is a 50% chance that the normal teacher will be there.
   - If the normal teacher is there, there is a 40% chance she will give an extension to the whole class.
     - Probability of not having to turn in homework due to a class extension: 50% * 40% = 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20 or 20%.
   - If the normal teacher is there and does not give a class extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
     - Probability of not having to turn in homework due to a personal extension: 50% * 60% * 20% = 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06 or 6%.

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in college. Then, we will determine how long it will take him to earn this amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost while in college:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

Next, we calculate the average loss per race:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = \(21.5 / 3 = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss is approximately $7.17.

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the heights are given in both feet and inches, we will convert everything to inches for simplicity.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, we use \( x + 4 \):

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, calculate \(0.79^3\):

\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493039 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial value:

\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \approx 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To find out how many Spanish books are in the library, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books: Since half of the 50 books are in English, we have:
   \[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

2. Calculate the number of German books: Since 10% of the books are in German, we have:
   \[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

3. Calculate the number of Spanish books: The remaining books are in Spanish, so we subtract the number of English and German books from the total:
   \[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Therefore, the total amount of food consumed per feeding is \( 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams} \).

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, the total amount of food consumed per day is:
   - \( 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \).

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each took, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 15 roses:**
   - The cost of a dozen (12) roses is $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 roses + 3 additional roses.
   - The cost of 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost of 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for 15 roses = $15 + $6 = $21.

2. **Determine the total amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five $5 bills.
   - Total amount of money = 5 * $5 = $25.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny should receive:**
   - Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of roses
   - Change = $25 - $21 = $4.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Number of quarters = $4 / $0.25 = 16.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the total sales for each item and then sum them up.

1. For the milkshakes:
   - He sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
   - Total from milkshakes = 6 * $5.50 = $33.00

2. For the burger platters:
   - He sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
   - Total from burger platters = 9 * $11 = $99.00

3. For the sodas:
   - He sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.
   - Total from sodas = 20 * $1.50 = $30.00

Now, we add up the totals from each item to get the total amount of money Terry makes:

Total money made = Total from milkshakes + Total from burger platters + Total from sodas
Total money made = $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00
Total money made = $162.00

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the total time from when he starts waiting until the fourth train arrives.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Therefore, the first train leaves 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

The total number of toothpicks required for the sculpture is 200. So, the number of toothpicks Melanie still needs to save is:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks she needs to save to reach her goal is:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Calculate the percentage discount based on the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold to his friend} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage discount based on the original price.**

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring creates a new jellyfish every second.

1. First, determine the number of seconds in 4 hours:
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 seconds = 14400 seconds

2. Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

3. With 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created is:
   - 5 springs * 14400 jellyfish/spring = 72000 jellyfish

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of direct proportion. If a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can find the growth rate per year and then use that rate to determine the growth over 13 years.

First, calculate the growth rate per year:
\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, use this growth rate to find the growth over 13 years:
\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during the month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.
3. **BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.
4. **MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars.
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars (since BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars).
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

\[ 67,500 + 11,250 + 52,500 = 131,250 \]

Marcel earned a total of 131,250 dollars from selling bicycles during that month.

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week and the additional time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

1. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class during the week:**
   - John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes each day, which totals 8 classes per day.
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - He goes to class for 5 days a week.

   \[
   \text{Total minutes per day} = 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total minutes per week} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.

   \[
   \text{Extra learning time per day} = \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total extra learning time per week} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total learning time per week:**
   - Add the class time and the extra learning time.

   \[
   \text{Total learning time per week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes/week} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

4. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

   \[
   \text{Total learning time in hours} = \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To determine how high the ball bounces on its second bounce, we first need to calculate the height from which the ball is initially dropped and then apply the bounce ratio for each bounce.

1. Calculate the initial drop height:
   - Each story is 24 feet high.
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Initial drop height = 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

2. Calculate the height after the first bounce:
   - The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height.
   - Height after the first bounce = 72 feet * (2/3) = 48 feet.

3. Calculate the height after the second bounce:
   - Again, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its previous height.
   - Height after the second bounce = 48 feet * (2/3) = 32 feet.

The ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left after the velociraptors had their share.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, the 540 kilograms is half of the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. This means that the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:

2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps based on the number of days he works.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = People helped per day * Number of days worked = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, you need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

There are three women wearing 4-inch heels and three women wearing 2-inch heels. 

The total height of the 4-inch heels is:
3 women * 4 inches/woman = 12 inches

The total height of the 2-inch heels is:
3 women * 2 inches/woman = 6 inches

The combined total height of all the heels is:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

The total number of women is:
3 women + 3 women = 6 women

The average height of the heels is:
18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and how many miles she plans to hike each day.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and the distance she will cover at her current plan is:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the revenue from the red balls:
   - There are 3 red balls, and each costs $9.
   - Revenue from red balls = 3 * $9 = $27

2. Calculate the revenue from the blue balls:
   - There are 11 blue balls, and each costs $5.
   - Revenue from blue balls = 11 * $5 = $55

3. Calculate the revenue from the green balls:
   - There are 25 green balls, and each costs $3.
   - Revenue from green balls = 25 * $3 = $75

4. Sum the revenues from all the balls to get the total revenue:
   - Total revenue = Revenue from red balls + Revenue from blue balls + Revenue from green balls
   - Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold.

"First, let's clarify the names in the problem. The names mentioned in the problem are Pierre, Paul, and Jacques. However, the question asks about Peter and James, who are not mentioned in the initial setup. I will assume that ""Peter"" is a typo and should be ""Pierre,"" and ""James"" is a typo and should be ""Jacques.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. The total weight of apples is 12 kg.
2. Pierre (Peter) wants a quarter of the apples: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) kg.
3. Paul wants a third of the apples: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) kg.

To find out how many kilograms Jacques (James) will have left, we subtract the amounts Pierre and Paul want from the total:

12 kg - 3 kg (Pierre's share) - 4 kg (Paul's share) = 5 kg.

So, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse blinks. We know that the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can find the rate of blinking per minute by dividing the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes:

\[ \text{Rate of blinking} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks we want by the rate of blinking:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fish in Tate's garden pond before and after the purchase.

Initially, the pond has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfish
- 5 female goldfish

After Tate buys more fish, the pond will have:
- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfish
- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfish

Now, we sum the total number of male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

To find out how many more female fish than male fish Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fish from the total number of female fish:
16 - 11 = 5

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent on their respective tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = Amalia's time + 4 hours = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, we sum the times for all three:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents. 

First, let's determine the one-way distance to his parents' house. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 miles per hour (mph), we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

This is the one-way distance. Since John makes a round trip, the total distance for one visit is:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles/visit} \times 2 \, \text{visits/month} = 560 \, \text{miles/month} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in one 10-hour shift.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of toys needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker must have produced.
3. Divide the number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift to find the hourly production rate.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:

- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. In a 10-hour shift, each of these workers produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Therefore, the two workers together produce \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

- Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. In a 10-hour shift, each of these workers produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Therefore, the two workers together produce \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Adding the production of the first four workers:
\[120 + 80 = 200\] toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means the fifth worker must have produced:
\[400 - 200 - 20 = 180\] toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \] toys per hour.

\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Arnold and Madeline**: Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs each of them painted as \( A \).

3. **Camden and Sarah**: Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Camden painted as \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \).

4. **Camden and Sarah's Relationship**: Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   C = S + 12
   \]

5. **Total Eggs Painted by Camden and Sarah**: We know that:
   \[
   C + S = 30
   \]

6. **Substitute \( C \) in the Total Equation**: Using the relationship \( C = S + 12 \), we substitute \( C \) in the total equation:
   \[
   (S + 12) + S = 30
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2S + 12 = 30
   \]
   \[
   2S = 18
   \]
   \[
   S = 9
   \]

7. **Calculate \( C \)**: Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
   \[
   C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
   \]

8. **Total Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline**: Since the total number of eggs painted is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, the remaining eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline are:
   \[
   56 - 30 = 26
   \]
   Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted:
   \[
   A = \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]

9. **Difference in Eggs Painted by Camden and Arnold**: Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
   \[
   C - A = 21 - 13 = 8
   \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds.

1. First, we determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. Since each group goes into one box, there will be 25 boxes.

3. Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:
   \[
   200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. Then, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:
   \[
   25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:
   \[
   200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, knowing that there are 16 ounces in a pound:

"To determine how much John makes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the usable length of the tree for logs.
2. Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
3. Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.

Step 1: Calculate the usable length of the tree.
- The tree is 80 feet tall, and 80% of it can be used for logs.
- Usable length = 80 feet * 80% = 80 * 0.8 = 64 feet

Step 2: Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
- Each log is 4 feet long.
- Number of logs = Usable length / Length of each log = 64 feet / 4 feet = 16 logs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.
- Each log can be cut into 5 planks.
- Total number of planks = Number of logs * Planks per log = 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.
- Each plank is sold for $1.2.
- Total revenue = Total number of planks * Price per plank = 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

Therefore, John makes $96.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the information about her walking speeds and the distances she covers.

First, let's find Grandma's walking speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

For the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using her speed on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many marbles Bob has initially.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of the marbles he has. We subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- The volume of water from the first mug is 4 ounces.
- The volume of water from the second mug is 1 ounce.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of a mixture is given by:

\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of the first substance.
- \( T_1 \) is the temperature of the first substance.
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of the second substance.
- \( T_2 \) is the temperature of the second substance.

Substituting the given values:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ 40 \leq \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{5} \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 40 \leq \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 200 \leq 132 + T_2 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[ 68 \leq T_2 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these increases to the initial numbers:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

Total number of cows after three weeks:
50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

Total number of chickens after three weeks:
20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700 animals

"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the discount applied, and then divide that total cost by the total number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   - Each pack costs $10.00.
   - Russell orders 4 packs.
   - Total cost without discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

3. Calculate the total cost with the discount:
   - Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
   - Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

4. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   - Each pack has 9 bagels.
   - Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's simplify this:

3 less than 6 potatoes = 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
1 less than 3 scoops = 3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Cross-multiplying gives:
3 * 18 = 2 * x
54 = 2x
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 (5+9) people, 5 are men and 9 are women.

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many groups of 14 people there are on the bus:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

This means there are 6 groups of 14 people. Since 9 out of every 14 people are women, the number of women on the bus initially is:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks.
3. Calculate the total cost of the rocks.
4. Compute the loss by subtracting the total revenue from the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy.
Adam has $100 and each rock costs $5.
Number of rocks = $100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks.
60% of 20 rocks = 0.60 * 20 = 12 rocks
Revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each = 12 * $7 = $84

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the rocks.
Total cost = 20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Step 4: Compute the loss.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

0.20 (probability of the first ticket winning) * 0.60 (probability of the second ticket winning) = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**

   Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand (100% / 20% = 5 bottles).

   Therefore, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
   \[
   2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine the current production capacity:**

   Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**

   The additional number of bottles required is the difference between the total number of bottles needed and the current production capacity:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. The number of $20 bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. He loses 10 of these $20 bills. The number of $20 bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill. The number of $20 bills he uses is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The number of $20 bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. He then triples his money. The total amount of money he has now is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. He converts all his money into $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he has is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

Therefore, the number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

3. Total goals scored in the match:
   - Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
   - Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.
   - Total goals in the match: 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches, using 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk each day:

- **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
  - Remaining chalk: \( 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.

- **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
  - Remaining chalk: \( 2.20 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

After Wednesday, the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after Wednesday.

The teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days after Monday before he has to recycle it.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity and then subtract these numbers from the total number of boys and girls in the class.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
1/3 of 12 girls = 12 / 3 = 4 girls on varsity.

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
1/4 of 12 boys = 12 / 4 = 3 boys on varsity.

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity.

The total number of students in the class is:
12 girls + 12 boys = 24 students.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27,000, and then divide that number by 3, since the books are to be distributed equally among 3 schools.

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:
   - Cost of 100 books = $500
   - Total money available = $27,000
   - Number of 100-book sets Bob can buy = $27,000 / $500 = 54 sets
   - Total number of books = 54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books

2. Calculate the number of books per school:
   - Total number of books = 5400
   - Number of schools = 3
   - Books per school = 5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books/school

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices her friends will consume.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

Total slices of cheese pizza consumed by 6 friends:
6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices

Total slices of pepperoni pizza consumed by 6 friends:
6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices

Next, we calculate how many whole pizzas are needed for each type:

For cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Total slices needed: 36 slices
- Number of cheese pizzas required: 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

For pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, he makes 20 / 4 = 5 snowballs every 15 minutes.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, the net increase in the number of snowballs every 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

To find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net increase per 15-minute interval:

60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is 20 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 300 minutes.

300 minutes is equivalent to 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.

   After using 38 bandages and receiving 50 bandages, the number of bandages at the end of the first day is:
   \[
   x - 38 + 50 = x + 12
   \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - The number of bandages at the end of the second day is:
   \[
   (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16
   \]

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages.
   - The number of bandages at the end of the third day is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour = 67.5 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $101.25/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
$101.25/week * 4 weeks = $405

Next, we add the attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance.
- Since she had no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 4 weeks.

So, her total attendance bonus for April is:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Now, we add her monthly earnings from her hourly wage to her attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
$405 + $40 = $445

Therefore, Jen will receive $445 in April.

Step 2: Determine the remaining shells after team Alphas have found their share.
- Total shells: 700
- Shells found by Alphas: 280
- Remaining shells: \( 700 - 280 = 420 \) shells.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shells found by team The Finders from the remaining shells.
- Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
- \( 60\% \) of 420 is \( 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \) shells.

Step 4: Subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The Finders from the total to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters.
- Shells found by Alphas: 280
- Shells found by The Finders: 252
- Total shells found by Alphas and The Finders: \( 280 + 252 = 532 \) shells.
- Shells found by Gogetters: \( 700 - 532 = 168 \) shells.

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Therefore, the selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} \times \frac{11}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated and then find the number of red jelly beans based on his estimate. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of jelly beans:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
2. When it departed Chengli city, it had 20 people.
3. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
4. On the second stop, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. So, the number of people entering at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
5. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**
   - Total cost = Cost before the price increase + Cost after the price increase
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all her visits to the museum.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of treats needed:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Total treats needed = 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - Therefore, the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     b = 3c - 2
     \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies.
   - So, we have:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]

4. **Substitute the expression for \( b \) into the total treats equation:**
   - Substitute \( b = 3c - 2 \) into \( c + b = 10 \):
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10
     \]

5. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4c - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4c = 12

"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a manicure and a pedicure with the 20% discount.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art.
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount:

- The cost of a manicure is $35.
- The cost of a pedicure is $40.
- The total cost without discount is $35 + $40 = $75.
- The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.
- The discounted cost is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the nail art:

- Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails.
- The cost per nail is $3.
- The total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:

- Total cost = $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can start by setting up the relationships described in the problem with the information given.

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem:
- Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.
- Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we get the number of paintings Shelley has: \( 27 + 12 = 39 \).

Now we know that Shelley has 39 paintings, which is also equal to \( K + 8 \). We can set up the equation:

\[ K + 8 = 39 \]

To find \( K \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.
2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72
3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price then decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, we have the distance Michael has traveled (3600 km) and the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km). To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total weekly cost is the sum of the cost of the pasta, the cheddar cheese, and the gruyere cheese:
$1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the yearly cost is:
$10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books each bookcase can hold.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books one bookcase can hold:

- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total books per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"To find out how many white hats Skyler has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of hats**: 100
2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the total hats are red, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after red hats are accounted for**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: The rest of the hats are white, so:
   \[

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to determine the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide that cost by the number of sticks in the bag.

The original cost of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the cost of the bag after the discount is:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

There are 30 sticks in the bag, so the cost per stick is:

$15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

Therefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to pass = 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There is a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people.
   - There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + (2 * 8) (for rooms)
   - Total flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 4 small candles for half the rooms and 5 medium candles for the other half.
   - Half of the 8 rooms is 4 rooms.
   - Total small candles = 4 (candles per room) * 4 (rooms) = 16
   - Total medium candles = 5 (candles per room) * 4 (rooms) = 20
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36 = 56

Therefore, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is 56.

"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Since solving the fifth side completes the cube, we don't need to add time for a sixth side.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time for each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**: 
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we sum the times to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed.**

Time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by the speaking speed.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

"To find out how much Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels during her trip through Germany, we need to calculate the costs for both the hotel and the bus rides.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel:
- Helen stayed for 3 nights.
- The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
- Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is 3 nights * $80/night = $240.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus rides:
- Helen rode the bus 7 times.
- Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
- The cost of one bus trip is 10% of $80, which is 0.10 * $80 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost for the bus rides is 7 trips * $8/trip = $56.

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
- Total cost = Cost of hotel + Cost of bus rides
- Total cost = $240 + $56 = $296.

Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas originally had before dropping 4 of them. 

Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so before dropping them, Dallas had:
21 marbles + 4 marbles = 25 marbles

Since Mazie had 52 marbles in total and gave all of them to the twins, and Dallas received 25 of them, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:
52 marbles - 25 marbles = 27 marbles

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

"To determine the force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, including the luggage and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children together weigh 75 pounds each, which totals 150 pounds.

The total weight is:
1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 pounds = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to apply 16 pounds of force to push the car.

"To determine how much crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length (long side) = 20 feet
- Width (short side) = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we know both of their ages, we can find the average:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
   - Daily consumption for one pig = 4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day.

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   - Daily consumption for five pigs = 8 pounds/day/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   - Weekly consumption = 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds/week.

4. **Determine the amount of feed left after a week:**
   - Initial amount of feed = 300 pounds.
   - Feed consumed in a week = 280 pounds.
   - Feed left = 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

1. Each of the 20 guests will eat 2 hot dogs, so the total number of hot dogs needed is:
   \( 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \)

2. John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so the additional number of hot dogs he needs to buy is:
   \( 40 \text{ hot dogs needed} - 4 \text{ hot dogs already have} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \)

3. Since hot dogs come in packs of 6, the number of packs John needs to buy is:
   \( \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \)

4. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the hot dogs is:
   \( 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \)

Therefore, John needs to spend 12 dollars on hot dogs.

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she meditates for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- In one week, she practices yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she practices yoga for 300 minutes * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time spent = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 2040 minutes / 60 = 34 hours.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 34 hours on meditation and yoga practice.

   - Therefore, 3 dozen seeds = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

2. Next, calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower:
   - A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   - 50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds.
   - Therefore, the total number of seeds in a large sunflower = 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- The deal is buy one get one 50% off, so the first T-shirt is $8, and the second T-shirt is 50% off, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.
- The total cost for the two T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.4 = $16.
- The price after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $12 + $24 = $36

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36.

   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron. Therefore, Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did.
   - Aaron's distance = 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron's speed = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Vanessa's speed = 1/8 miles per minute / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

4. **Determine the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time for Vanessa = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

"To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes a week from reservations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of one reservation.
2. Multiply the cost of one reservation by the number of reservations per night.
3. Multiply the nightly total by the number of days the restaurant is open per week.

Step 1: Cost of one reservation
- Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
- Total cost per reservation = (2 meals * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15

Step 2: Total cost for all reservations per night
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- Total cost per night = 6 reservations * $15 = $90

Step 3: Total cost for the week
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- Total cost per week = 2 days * $90 = $180

Therefore, the restaurant makes $180 a week from reservations.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost price of the watermelons:
   Total cost price = $80

2. Calculate the total profit:
   Profit percentage = 25%
   Total profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

3. Calculate the total selling price:
   Total selling price = Total cost price + Total profit
   Total selling price = $80 + $20 = $100

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
   Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19 years old. Since James is 18 years old, John's current age is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.

The cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

Each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
