"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half the amount of white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[
2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is:

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total costs from this value.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: $80,000
2. **Cost of Repairs**: $50,000
3. **Total Costs**: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house:

4. **Increase in Value**: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
5. **New Value of the House**: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, we calculate the profit:

6. **Profit**: New Value - Total Costs = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, Josh's profit is:

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed the entire flock needs per day.
3. Determine how much feed has already been given in the morning and afternoon meals.
4. Subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much is needed for the final meal.

Step 1: Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

Step 2: Wendi has 20 chickens, so the total daily feed requirement for the flock is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Step 3: The amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Step 4: The amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups (total daily requirement)} - 40 \text{ cups (already given)} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 8 glasses (since every second glass is discounted, and 8 is half of 16):
- The cost for the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, and 15th glasses (8 glasses) is $5 each.
- The cost for the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, and 16th glasses (8 glasses) is $3 each.

Now, calculate the total cost:
- Cost for the 8 full-price glasses: \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) dollars
- Cost for the 8 discounted glasses: \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the time spent downloading before the restart, the time for the restart, and the time to download the file again from the beginning.

1. **Initial Download Time Before Restart:**
   - Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of the 200 GB file is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Time for Windows Restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Time to Download the File Again:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - Time to download the full 200 GB file is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance John initially travels:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Determine the distance John covers during his return trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return trip is 4 hours and he has already spent 2.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance John covers on his return trip:**
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Determine how far John is from home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance traveled back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum these costs.

1. **Donuts:**
   - She bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the cumulative profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost**: $3 for watering and feeding

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

**Cumulative Profit**:
We need to find the number of years \( n \) such that the cumulative profit is at least equal to the initial cost of $90.

\[ \text{Cumulative Profit} = n \times \text{Net Annual Profit} \]
\[ n \times \$7.5 \geq \$90 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuums sold at the green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Vacuums left after the green house} = x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuums left after the red house} = \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuums sold at the orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Vacuums left after the orange house} = \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Vacuums left after the orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

We know that after the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   \[
   2x = 36

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Already Covered} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum these amounts after accounting for the spill.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters.

2. **Account for the spill:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining orange drink is 9 liters.
   - The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

4. **Sum the amounts of water:**
   - Total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters (9 liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink): \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters.

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age by \( D \) and Allen's age by \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We are also given that their total age is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the total age equation:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, solve for \( A \):
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 80 plus 20 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed and use it to find her running speed:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.
   - Therefore, running speed = 2 * skipping speed = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running speed is four times faster than walking speed.
   - Therefore, walking speed = running speed / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = one-third of total time = 6 / 3 = 2 hours.
   - Time spent walking = two-thirds of total time = 2 * (6 / 3) = 4 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed * time spent running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed * time spent walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her usual 400 feet. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine the number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.**

- The bag has 5 servings.
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

**Step 2: Determine the number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target.**

- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Remaining calories you can consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

**Step 3: Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.**

- Each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g.
- Therefore, each serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60g.
- To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we use the ratio of calories to grams:
  - 250 calories = 60g
  - 1 calorie = 60g / 250 calories = 0.24g
  - 200 calories = 200 * 0.24g = 48g

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She then used 220 Post-it notes at work, leaving her with 23 Post-it notes.

The equation representing this situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 163.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of teams, the number of players per team, and the number of coaches per team.

1. Each school has 2 teams (one girls' team and one boys' team).
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each team has 1 coach.

First, calculate the total number of players per school:
- Each school has 2 teams, and each team has 5 players.
- Therefore, each school has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) players.

5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let \(x\) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. This total must equal the number of cars that were left after the 5 cars took an exit.

So, we have:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To determine how many potted plants Mary will have remaining, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.
2. Subtract the number of potted plants she will give away.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

Next, add the 18 new potted plants she received:
- Total potted plants = 80 (existing) + 18 (new) = 98.

Now, calculate the number of potted plants she will give away:
- She will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.
- Therefore, the number of potted plants she will give away is 40.

Finally, subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she has:
- Remaining potted plants = 98 - 40 = 58.

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

"To determine how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, Henry intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.
5. We can set up the equation: \( 2x + 15 = 115 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
2x + 15 = 115
\]

Subtract 15 from both sides:

\[
2x = 100
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 50

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will generate from selling it at the new, higher prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- Revenue from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of containers imported on the second day. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Count**: On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
   - Total vehicles on the first day = 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

2. **Total Vehicles After Second Day**: After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port was 30.

3. **Vehicles Added on the Second Day**: The number of vehicles added on the second day can be calculated by subtracting the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles.
   - Vehicles added on the second day = 30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (initial) = 20 vehicles.

4. **Number of Containers on the Second Day**: Each container contains 5 vehicles. Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
   - Number of containers = 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. We can set up the equation:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% from his salary four years ago. Therefore:
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase in Adrien's salary and apply it to Lylah's salary. Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so:
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 99076.92 \]

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate both the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total time spent on patients per day:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

2. **Convert the total time spent on patients to hours:**
   - Total time in hours = 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

4. **Calculate the total cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

5. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"To determine how many elves are left after the described events, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of elves**: Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. **Elves who quit after children vomit on them**: A third of the elves quit. 
   - A third of 60 is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \).
   - Therefore, 20 elves quit.
   - Remaining elves: \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

3. **Elves who quit after kids kick their shins**: 10 of the remaining elves quit.
   - Remaining elves: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

Thus, the number of elves left is 30.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q \]
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return as she saw leave in the first 6 hours.
   - Half of 30 bees is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
   - So, 15 bees return to the hive.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Two times 30 bees is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
   - So, 60 bees leave the hive.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left before the last 6 hours: 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (third 6 hours) = 90 bees.
   - Bees that had already returned: 15 bees.
   - Bees that hadn't returned: 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all the days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to find the total class hours for the semester:

"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish caught by both and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin. Since Anakin caught 10 starfish, Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin. Since Anakin caught 6 sea horses, Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin. Since Anakin caught 3 clownfish, Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, let's sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum up all the fish caught:
\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

Thus, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is 32.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase interval:**
   - Initial price: $20
   - Increase interval: every 2 months
   - Increase rate: 20% of the original price

2. **Calculate the number of increases over 36 months:**
   - 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

3. **Determine the price after each increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Therefore, each increase adds $4 to the price.

4. **Calculate the total increase over 18 intervals:**
   - Total increase = 18 * $4 = $72

5. **Calculate the final price:**
   - Final price = Initial price + Total increase
   - Final price = $20 + $72 = $92

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be expressed as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \):

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
     \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
   - Converting this to a percentage:
     \[
     2 \times 100\% = 200\%

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and set up an equation.

1. **Rats**: There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. Therefore, the total number of rats is \( 3r \), and the total straw given to the rats is \( 6 \times 3r = 18r \).

2. **Hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Since each cage has one hamster, the total straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) pieces.

3. **Rabbits**: There is a pen of rabbits, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw**: The total amount of straw distributed is 160 pieces.

We can set up the equation for the total straw distributed:

"To determine the total amount of insects needed per day for a flock of ten ducks, we first calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock and then divide by 7 to find the daily requirement.

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock:
   - Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
   - For 10 ducks: \( 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \).

2. Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Daily requirement: \( 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \).

The flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees added each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

Step 1: Net number of trees added each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees added each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
\[ 50 + (8 \times 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 \]

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \]

Step 4: Number of trees left
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \]

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink plastic flamingos on Friday morning:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Number of flamingos taken back and painted white on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were painted white and put back out on the front yard.

3. **Number of pink and white flamingos on Saturday morning:**
   - After taking back and painting 6 pink flamingos, the remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.

4. **Number of flamingos added on Sunday morning:**
   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

5. **Difference between the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday:**
   - The number of pink flamingos is 30.
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white chickens than red chickens. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

From the problem, we know:
1. The big pool is leaking at 4 gallons/minute.
2. The small pool is also leaking at 4 gallons/minute.
3. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
4. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, let's express the amounts of water in the pools 4 minutes ago:
- 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we use the information that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Set the two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]

Solve for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total travel time for Andrew's round trip, where he travels to Rochester by bus and returns by car.

1. **Travel time by bus**: It takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.
2. **Travel time by car**: It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

Now, we add the travel times for both legs of the trip:
- Travel time to Rochester by bus: 6 days
- Travel time back to New Jersey by car: 3 days

Total travel time = 6 days + 3 days = 9 days

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9.

"First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is 33%.

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we first need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute. Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's, which is:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Together, their combined rate is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces at this combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time in hours is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Thus, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites.
3. Subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
- The total weight of the tree is \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, determine the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites:
- The termites ate 30% of the wood.
- The weight of the eaten wood is \( 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \).

Finally, subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the total weight to find the remaining weight:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, we can find \( J_a \) using the first equation:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we can find \( J_b \) using the third equation:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find \( A_b \) using the second equation:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies:**
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the amount needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:**
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Sum the amounts of flour needed for both days:**
   - Total flour needed:
     \[
     6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Selling Price of the House:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$350,000
   \]

2. **Brokerage Fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

3. **Transfer Fee:**

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents. 

1 quarter = 25 cents
5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents

1 dime = 10 cents
2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

Total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.

"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, we first calculate the total number of stars contributed by the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows.

The three rows of 8 stars contribute:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

The two rows of 6 stars contribute:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars from the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Therefore, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each 5-star row contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of 5-star rows is:

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over a period of fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and new legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculating the number of new arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated by dividing the total number of days by the interval at which new arms grow:
     \[
     \text{Number of new arms} = \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ arms}
     \]

2. **Calculating the number of new legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated by dividing the total number of days by the interval at which new legs grow:
     \[
     \text{Number of new legs} = \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ legs}
     \]

3. **Calculating the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs:
     \[
     \text{Total new limbs} = 5 \text{ arms} + 3 \text{ legs} = 8 \text{ limbs}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of people:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **Number of people who left:**
   - 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 = 10 people left.

3. **Number of people remaining:**
   - Total remaining: 40 - 10 = 30

4. **Number of men remaining:**
   - 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Number of women remaining:**
   - Total remaining people: 30
   - Men remaining: 22
   - Women remaining: 30 - 22 = 8

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \).

The equation for the total number of pencils Jam has is:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid (cream) added.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many old records were traded for the 7 new records. According to the store's policy, 2 old records are required to get 1 new record. 

Let's denote the number of old records as \( x \). Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of new records obtained is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

We know that the 5 people left with 7 new records, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 7 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ x = 7 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.
   \[
   \text{Salary of senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total payroll for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total payroll for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

6. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total payroll for all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the customer had $4 in rewards to use on their current shopping trip. 

Next, the customer used these rewards and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. Therefore, the coupon value is:

\[ \text{Coupon value} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the current shopping trip:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can express these as:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so:
   - Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself:

- Pink frog = 50 pounds
- Blue beetle = 50 pounds
- Green toad = 50 pounds
- Yellow snake = 60 pounds
- Red bird = 30 pounds

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to compare the total cost of the two options.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ride ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost for one ride is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Dasha's total cost: \$36
- David's total cost: \$30

The amount of money David saves is:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves \$6.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Number of Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Number of Millipedes**: She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. Therefore, the number of millipedes is:
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Number of Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Therefore, the number of stink bugs is:

- The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, dromedaries have 1 hump each) is 304.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can solve the first equation for \( d \):
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c \), we can find \( d \) using the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   \[
   200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   \[
   30\% \times 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Next 1 day**: He wasn't traveling at all.
   \[
   0 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   \[
   300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
   \]

Now, summing all the distances:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[
3140 \text{ km}

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we calculate the difference between the comb's elevation and Oliver's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - Let \( P_t \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.
   - Let \( P_j \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28, so the savings from the tattered jeans is \( P_t - 28 = 4 \).
   - Solving for \( P_t \), we get \( P_t = 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is \( P_j - 22 = 2 \).
   - Solving for \( P_j \), we get \( P_j = 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokémon cards Kenny started with. Let's break down the information given:

1. Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. After selling the cards, he has $50 left for spending cash.
4. He keeps 1/3 of his cards.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kenny needs to have after selling the cards:
- Cost of the ticket: $100
- Spending cash: $50
- Total amount needed: $100 + $50 = $150

Next, we need to determine how many cards he sold to get $150. Since each card is sold for $1.5, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for the number of cards sold:
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

Kenny sold 100 cards. Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he kept is:
\[ \text{Number of cards kept} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total number of cards} \]

Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with. Then:
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \]

We know that the number of cards sold is 100:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these 18 guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each get 1 hotdog, so he prepared \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for them.
   - In total, he prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short is \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( \frac{26}{1} = 26 \) guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount. 

1. The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
2. The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
3. The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is:
\[ 132.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]

\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]

\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to Marcus baking. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees.

\[ \text{Temperature increase from baking} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} = 15 \, \text{degrees} \]

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature will be:

\[ \text{Temperature after baking} = 40 \, \text{degrees} + 15 \, \text{degrees} = 55 \, \text{degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. 

\[ \text{Cooling rate} = 2 \, \text{degrees/10 minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total cooling time} = 30 \, \text{minutes} \]

To find the total temperature decrease:

\[ \text{Total temperature decrease} = \left( \frac{30 \, \text{minutes}}{10 \, \text{minutes}} \right) \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 3 \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 6 \, \text{degrees} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon and then use the information about James's performance to find out how long it took him to complete the run.

First, let's calculate Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it took James to complete each segment:
- James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

- James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Therefore, James's bike time is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time it took James to complete the run. According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 180 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

Next, we need to find the new cost per balloon after the price increase. The problem states that the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price. This can be done by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

Thus, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( D = 9 \) back into the equations to find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that fraction into yards based on the total length of a skein.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate the total yards used by multiplying \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273

\[ 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on clothes. The remaining amount after buying clothes is:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on CDs. The remaining amount after buying CDs is:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:

\[ 90,000 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially:

- Ali has four $10 bills, which total to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali also has six $20 bills, which total to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Ali is left with:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, Ali uses \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour and then sum these amounts.

1. **Tony's picking rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
   - Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
   - Kathy's rate = 2 * 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour.

Now, we sum the rates of all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts/hour

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem:

- Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( S_O \) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has.
- Let \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

First, we solve for \( C_O \) using the information about Ophelia's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find \( C_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's and Ophelia's chairs:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we find \( S_J \) using the relationship between Jenna's sofas and chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out the cost of the headphone set. 

The total amount Tom paid is $48, and the cost of one CD is $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we need to determine how many additional CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Thus, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can break down the information given:

1. Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for most of the weeks.
2. There were two consecutive weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. There was one week where he worked out for 6 hours.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours:
- There are 8 weeks in total.
- He worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, which accounts for 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours is \(8 - 3 = 5\) weeks.

Next, calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
- \(5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours}\).

Now, add the hours for the weeks he worked out 5 hours:
- \(2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}\).

Finally, add the hours for the week he worked out 6 hours:
- \(1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

Summing all these hours together:
- \(20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours}\).

   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the total cost of the printer and the monitors. We know the following:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of the computer} - \text{Cost of the printer} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

Since this is the total cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{\text{Total cost of 2 monitors}}{2} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is:

   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount saved daily in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, the amount saved daily in the second half of April is \( 2x \).

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \)

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 1125 = 15x + 30x \)
   - \( 1125 = 45x \)

"To solve this problem, let's break down the steps Elise takes:

1. **First, she writes the full alphabet twice:**
   - The English alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice means: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Next, she writes half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Writing half once means: \(13\) letters.

3. **Then, she re-writes everything she has already written:**
   - She has already written \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything means: \(65\) letters.

4. **Total letters written:**
   - Sum of all the letters written: \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is:

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first determine the cost of each item before the discount:

- Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator * $12/calculator = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10/set = $10.00

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop offers a 10% discount on all items, so we calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Total cost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in the buttons. We know that there are 21 buttons in total, with 7 buttons having 2 holes each and the remaining buttons having 4 holes each.

First, let's determine the number of buttons with 4 holes:
- Total buttons: 21
- Buttons with 2 holes: 7
- Buttons with 4 holes: 21 - 7 = 14

Next, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 2 holes:
- Number of buttons with 2 holes: 7
- Holes per button: 2
- Total holes from these buttons: 7 * 2 = 14

Then, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with 4 holes:
- Number of buttons with 4 holes: 14
- Holes per button: 4
- Total holes from these buttons: 14 * 4 = 56

Finally, we add the total holes from both types of buttons:
- Total holes: 14 (from 2-hole buttons) + 56 (from 4-hole buttons) = 70

Thus, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles required for his sons' birthdays.

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is \(12 - 4 = 8\).

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles needed:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Each pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks to get the total:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \), and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy, we can break down the payments as follows:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For each of the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth. Therefore, for three teeth, the total is:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For each of the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, half of this amount is:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
   \]
   Therefore, for two teeth, the total is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, so the oven is overheating by 18 degrees.

The percentage increase can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is overheating by 4%. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to when her recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x \) plus 4% of \( x \):
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = x + 0.04x = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Adding the durations of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships mathematically as follows:

\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles its height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( H(n) \). The initial height is 4 feet, so \( H(0) = 4 \).

The height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) can be expressed as:
\[ H(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( H(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height for each day:

- Day 0: \( H(0) = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \) feet
- Day 1: \( H(1) = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \) feet
- Day 2: \( H(2) = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \) feet
- Day 3: \( H(3) = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \) feet

On day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate his earnings for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the first four hours were \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over four hours, his total earnings were \( 7.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the next two hours were \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
- Over two hours, his total earnings were \( 6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \( 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in one year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years it will take:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42 on the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants:
   - 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter.
   - Therefore, 4 dozen croissants will require \( 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \) pound of butter.

2. Calculate the total amount of butter needed for a week (7 days):
   - If 4 dozen croissants require 1 pound of butter per day, then for 7 days, the total amount of butter needed is \( 1 \times 7 = 7 \) pounds.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cars towed over the week, considering the different rates for the first three days and the remaining four days.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. Therefore, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height requirement of 4 feet is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches. We can set up the equation:

40 inches + 2 inches/year * number of years = 48 inches

Solving for the number of years:

2 inches/year * number of years = 48 inches - 40 inches
2 inches/year * number of years = 8 inches
number of years = 8 inches / 2 inches/year
number of years = 4

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, the relative speed is:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed. The distance Tom needs to cover to catch up is 75 miles, and he is closing this gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Therefore, the time \( t \) it takes for Tom to catch up is:
\[ t = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per class over $10.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: $60
2. **Total Number of Classes**: 10

If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny's parents will sign him up again if he attends all 10 classes.

Now, let's determine how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class if he misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) customers per day.

3. **Calculate the combined daily production:**
   - Combined daily production = Jewel's daily production + Julie's daily production
   - Combined daily production = 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day

4. **Calculate the total weekly production:**
   - They work all 7 days of the week.
   - Total weekly production = Combined daily production \(\times\) 7
   - Total weekly production = 150 \(\times\) 7 = 1050 customers

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

The distribution of these days over the first 24 days is as follows:
- **First 8 days**: All good.
- **Next 8 days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 days**: All neutral.

Now, we need to consider the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

Let's update the counts:
- **Good Days**: Initially 12, plus 2 more good days from the next three days, so \(12 + 2 = 14\) good days.
- **Neutral Days**: Initially 10, plus 1 more neutral day from the next three days, so \(10 + 1 = 11\) neutral days.
- **Bad Days**: Remains 8.

The total number of days now is \(24 + 3 = 27\) days.

To find out how many good days are left in the month:
- Total days in the month: 30
- Days already accounted for: 27
- Days remaining: \(30 - 27 = 3\)

Since the remaining days are not specified, we assume they are neutral (as no information is given about them being good or bad).

   - Growth needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

3. Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches:
   - Growth rate = 30 inches per day
   - Number of days = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Thus, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now.
   - Total dogs initially: 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs.

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James needs to buy toys for the 8 new dogs.
   - Toys needed: 8 toys.
   - Total toys after first purchase: 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.

3. **Second Visit:**
   - When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left.
   - Number of dogs when he left: 12.
   - Number of dogs now: 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
   - Additional toys needed: 24 (current) - 12 (initial) = 12 toys.
   - Total toys after second purchase: 12 (initial) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.

4. **Third Visit:**
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone.
   - Number of dogs now: 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
   - James no longer needs toys for the 3 dogs that are gone.
   - Total toys needed: 21 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

"To determine Skyler's investment, we need to follow the steps of the investments made by Dylan and Frances, and then calculate the remaining amount for Skyler.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   - Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   - Total amount = $1200.
   - Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \).

2. **Remaining Amount after Dylan's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment.
   - Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720.

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   - Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \).

4. **Remaining Amount after Frances's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Remaining amount after Dylan's investment - Frances's investment.
   - Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240.

5. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after Dylan's and Frances's investments.
   - Skyler's investment = 240.

Thus, Skyler's investment is \( \boxed{240} \)."
"To determine how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Adding these together gives:

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. Therefore, the final length of the dress is \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost for 10 candies is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let \( T \) be the total bill.
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the fundraising goal of $6300, given that the firefighters raised $2100 in the first 3 hours and assuming an equal amount is raised each hour.

First, let's calculate the hourly rate of fundraising:
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300:
\[ \text{Total hours required} = \frac{\text{Total goal}}{\text{Hourly rate}} = \frac{6300}{700} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for all purposes, which is given as 40%.
2. Calculate the percentage of this 40% that is used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the city's water use is for industrial purposes, we calculate 80% of 40%:
   \[
   0.80 \times 40\% = 32\%
   \]
3. Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

Thus, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

For the gallon jars:
\[ \text{Total cost for gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

For the half-gallon jars:
\[ \text{Total cost for half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students like to play video games. Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 50
- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5
- The rest of the students like to play video games or play music.

First, we calculate the number of students who like to play music. According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students who have hobbies other than playing video games:

\[ \text{Total students with other hobbies} = 10 \, (\text{bake}) + 5 \, (\text{basketball}) + 10 \, (\text{music}) = 25 \]

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to play video games:

\[ \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of students who like to play video games is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the trades step by step and calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total small buttons:**

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cases of shingles needed for each house. Let \( x \) be the number of cases needed for the first house. According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. The third house needs double the first house, which is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate the cost for each category of movies.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**:
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - Cost of each series movie: \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the cost of a normal movie.
   - Cost of a normal movie: $10
   - Cost of each series movie: \( \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \) dollars
   - Total cost for series movies: \( 200 \times 1.67 = 333.33 \) dollars

3. **Remaining movies**:
   - Total remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)

4. **Older movies**:
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \)
   - Cost of each older movie: $5
   - Total cost for older movies: \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars

5. **Newer movies**:
   - Number of newer movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long they drove. The total travel time was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:
\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance they drove is calculated by multiplying the driving time by their driving speed:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance to their vacation spot is:
\[ 255 \]"
"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points they each earn and then find the difference.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Ava's points:
- Enemies: \( (E + 8) \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( (B + 3) \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( (T - 4) \times 30 \)

Emma's points:
- Enemies: \( E \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( B \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( T \times 30 \)

Now, let's calculate the total points for each:

Ava's total score:
\[ 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

Emma's total score:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

The difference between their scores:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ = -25 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides per day = 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = Rides on usual days + Rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2(4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.
2. Determine the total amount of gas used each week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gas used each week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, which is a round trip of:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (one way)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles (round trip)} \]

He drives this distance from Monday to Friday, so the total weekly distance is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of gas used each week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the total amount of gas used each week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gas used each week.**

The price of gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost of gas each week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:
\[ 15 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, which includes the quarters and a portion of the twenties.

First, let's determine the total value of the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- The total value of the quarters is \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

Next, let's determine the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has 10 twenties.
- The total value of the twenties is \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties:
- The amount spent from the twenties is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = \( 35 + 120 = 155 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total number of TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   - One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40.
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   - One-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs.
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \).

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:
   - The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs.
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs).
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between these distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Given the height of the mosaic, calculate the length of the mosaic.

First, calculate the total number of glass chips:
- Each bag holds 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Next, determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
- Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Now, given that the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length:
- Area of the mosaic = height * length.
- 12 square inches = 3 inches * length.
- Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. We can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
\]

\[
\text{Total branches} = 420
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
\]

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

Finally, find \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance: \( 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance of first segment + Distance of second segment
   - Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of 4 turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance.

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price of the laptop is:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400
   \]
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:
   \[
   400 - 50 = 350
   \]
4. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount she has received from these sources is:
   \[
   150 + 80 = 230
   \]
5. Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money in her purse and the money she has received:
   \[
   x + 230 = 350
   \]
6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 350 - 230 = 120
   \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production from the current cows. 

The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total milk production from the 3 cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required to produce the extra 10 liters is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires:
2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = 10 minutes per group

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total available time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal),
- \( t \) is the time in years (3 years).

First, we calculate the annual interest rate as a decimal:
\[ r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \]

Now, we can calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

Next, we add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

1. **White Shirts with Collars and No Collars:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Floral Shirts with Buttons and No Buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts with no collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of each type of car and then use the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars.

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. **Total Cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total. We can set up the equation to find the number of yellow cars:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (\text{Number of red cars} + \text{Number of green cars} + \text{Number of blue cars})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cars} = 23
   \]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have \( S \) in terms of \( F \). We can substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.**

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:
\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.**

Each chicken is sold for $50:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

**Step 3: Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.**

The profit formula is:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
\]
Given that the profit is $2000:
\[
2000 = 9000 - \text{Total cost}
\]
Solving for the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

Thus, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many glasses of lemonade the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold in total and then how many each of them sold individually.

1. Julie sold 14 glasses.
2. The total number of glasses sold by all three is 32.
3. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by the boys together is \(32 - 14 = 18\).

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, each boy sold 9 glasses.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the cost of the new rope she wants to buy.
3. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she gets from selling her old rope to find the leftover amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 per meter.
\[ \text{Total money from selling} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine the cost of the new rope.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah will buy a 20-meter rope.
\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate the leftover money.
\[ \text{Leftover money} = \text{Total money from selling} - \text{Cost of new rope} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 30 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to account for the extended duration and the encore of the final concert. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore. Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as \( x \) minutes.

The equation representing the final concert's duration is:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

First, we subtract 15 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Thus, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 50\right) = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by both:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis on that day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages each person read and then find the difference.

1. **Pages read by Denise:**
   - Yesterday: 10 pages
   - Today: 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, so Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

   Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages

2. **Pages read by Daniel:**
   - Yesterday: 13 pages
   - Today: 0 pages

   Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages

3. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - Denise read 28 pages
   - Daniel read 13 pages

   Difference: \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have 1 adult bowl.
3. Each of the two children will have 1 child bowl.

First, we convert the total soup into a common unit. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the pot contains:
\[ 4 \text{ adult bowls} \times 2 \text{ child bowls/adult bowl} = 8 \text{ child bowls} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of bowls used for dinner:
- Calvin and his wife: \( 2 \text{ adult bowls} \times 2 \text{ child bowls/adult bowl} = 4 \text{ child bowls} \)
- Two children: \( 2 \text{ child bowls} \)

Total bowls used for dinner:
\[ 4 \text{ child bowls} + 2 \text{ child bowls} = 6 \text{ child bowls} \]

Now, we find the number of child bowls left:
\[ 8 \text{ child bowls} - 6 \text{ child bowls} = 2 \text{ child bowls} \]

Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will be able to have:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 1 \text{ bowl per child} \]

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total Material Required:**
   - Adding the material for small and large masks: \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
2. Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).
3. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
4. Duncan's current age is 60, so \( D = 60 \).

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[
60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
52 = 2(A - 4)
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
26 = A - 4
\]
Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[
A = 30
\]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[
30 + 8 = 38
\]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equation based on the total pieces of bologna thrown:

\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

We are given that \( r = 20 \). Substituting \( r \) into the equation:

\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides:

\[ 3y = 18 \]

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons. 
   - Number of sets of 2 balloons in 12 balloons: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
   - Total cost for 12 balloons: \( 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \) dollars
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each.
   - Total cost for 2 tubs: \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) dollars

Now, we sum up all the expenses:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

The total amount of money spent is $28. Since this amount was combined from both Julia's and Nadine's allowances, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:

"To determine the total profit raised by the class from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students in the class.
\[
\text{Total number of lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - Maria has 4 friends, and she gives each friend 2 water balloons.
   - Total balloons given to friends: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - Maria has 1 water balloon for herself.

   So, the total number of balloons at the start is:
   \[
   8 + 1 = 9
   \]

2. **Additional Balloons from Maria's Mom:**
   - Maria's mom gives each person (Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons.
   - Total number of people: \(1 + 4 = 5\)
   - Total additional balloons: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)

3. **Total Balloons:**
   - Adding the initial balloons to the additional balloons:
   \[
   9 + 15 = 24
   \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls have is:

"To determine how many new tables are needed, we first calculate the total number of boxes of stuff the charity group has.

1. Calculate the total number of boxes donated by 10 people:
   \( 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \)

2. Add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have:
   \( 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \)

3. Determine the total number of tables required to fit all the boxes, given that 2 boxes fit per table:
   \( \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \)

4. Subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables required:
   \( 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \)

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spends on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two additional equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

First, we calculate the total number of pages per inch and then for the entire thickness of the book:

\[ \text{Total pages per inch} = 100 \]
\[ \text{Total thickness of the book} = 1.5 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the total thickness to find the total number of pages:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contains 2 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much the travel costs, we first need to calculate 50% of the total cost of the supplies and then add that to the original cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400. 

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

The total cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel costs $600.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
2. Let \( S \) represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( W \) represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Together they have caught 339 Pokemon: \( A + S + W = 339 \)
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( A = S + 5 \)
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: \( S = 4W - 13 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( W \).

First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4W - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Total distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the number of boxes sold on each day:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_S = 10 \) (gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (apple pie sold on Saturday is 4 fewer than gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 \) (gingerbread sold on Sunday is 5 more than gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( A_U = 15 \) (apple pie sold on Sunday)

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on each day:
- \( A_S = 10 - 4 = 6 \)
- \( G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \)
- \( A_U = 15 \)

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \)
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \)
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \)

Finally, we sum up the total earnings for both days:
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 60 + 90 = 150 \)
- Total earnings on Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \)
- Total earnings for two days: \( 150 + 315 = 465 \)

Thus, Sunny earned a total of \( 465 \) dollars over the two days.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

2. **Gas bill checks**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

3. **Church checks**: 2 checks per month
   - 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**: 1 check per quarter
   - 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12 checks/year
- Gas bill checks: 12 checks/year
- Church checks: 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4 checks/year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in a day.

2. **Determine the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) flights.

3. **Determine the number of remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) flights.

4. **Determine the number of flights to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) flights.

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Therefore, Igneous' howl duration is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) seconds.

Next, we sum the durations of all three wolves' howls:
- Total howl duration = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous' howl
- Total howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds
- Total howl duration = 120 seconds

Finally, we convert the total howl duration from seconds to minutes:
- 120 seconds = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and using the information given:

- Let \( A \) be the age of Akbar.
- Let \( L \) be the age of Alessandro.
- Let \( H \) be the age of Helene.
- Let \( W \) be the age of Wilfred.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A = 3 \)
- \( L = 4 \)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + L + H + W = 20 \).

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( L \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon is divided into slices for 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total size of the watermelon can be expressed as:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated by dividing the size of one adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To find out how long James spends reading, we first need to determine the rate at which he reads. James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, his reading rate is:

\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to read 18 pages. Using the reading rate, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Reading rate}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24
   - The remaining questions are 60 - 24 = 36
   - These 36 questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions.
   - Number of average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Number of difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - Number of easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct.
   - Number of average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9
   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct.
   - Number of difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Thus, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he mines twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he mines 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days:**
   - In 30 days, 40 dwarves mine \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds of ore.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two further scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
       - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
       - Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
     - Total probability = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Turning in Homework:**
   - Probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework = 1 - Total probability of not turning in homework
   - Probability = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 or 24%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]

\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for the depreciated value after \( n \) years is:
\[ V = P (1 - r)^n \]
where:
- \( V \) is the value after \( n \) years,
- \( P \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( n = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ V = 20000 (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 (0.79)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ V \approx 9860.78 \]

The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in that period. Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, so in 30 days, she drinks:

\[ 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups} \]

Next, we convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon:

\[ \frac{240 \, \text{cups}}{16 \, \text{cups/gallon}} = 15 \, \text{gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor with new square tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles required.
2. Determine the total cost based on the number of tiles and the cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles required.**

Each tile is 1 square foot (since each side is 1 foot in length). The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = \text{Total area of the kitchen floor} = 200 \, \text{tiles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost.**

The cost of each tile is $12. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \times 12 = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is:
\[ 2400 \]

"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year after his accident, we first need to calculate the new monthly cost of the insurance.

The normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month. After the accident, the cost increased by 60%. 

To find the increase in cost:
\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ \text{New Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

"To determine the number of laundry loads Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the weekly and then the annual laundry loads.

1. **Weekly Laundry Calculation:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets per load and 1 king set of sheets per load.
   - For the twin beds: \( \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads} \)
   - For the king size bed: \( 1 \text{ king set} = 1 \text{ load} \)
   - Total weekly loads: \( 2 \text{ loads (twin)} + 1 \text{ load (king)} = 3 \text{ loads} \)

2. **Annual Laundry Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total annual loads: \( 3 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 156 \text{ loads} \)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - There are 4 pizzas.

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the times spent by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.
2. Subtract the number of guests who cannot come to find the number of guests attending.
3. Determine the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the theater rental fee and the additional guest fee.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- Additionally, she invited 13 family members.

Total guests invited = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45 guests.

Next, we account for the 4 guests who said they could not come:
Total guests attending = 45 (invited) - 4 (not coming) = 41 guests.

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 guests. We need to calculate the cost for the additional guests:
Number of additional guests = 41 (attending) - 20 (included in the base fee) = 21 additional guests.

The cost for each additional guest is $6:
Cost for additional guests = 21 (additional guests) * $6 (per guest) = $126.

Now, we add the base fee to the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost:
Total cost = $125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

   - First train leaves 30 minutes after Paul arrives, so the second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul arrives.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves 65 minutes after Paul arrives, so the third train arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves 125 minutes after Paul arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves 125 minutes after Paul arrives, so the fourth train arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul arrives.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs.

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Total toothpicks saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

2. Determine how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200:
   - Total toothpicks needed = 200 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks already saved = 120 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks still needed = 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks.

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining toothpicks:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - Toothpicks still needed = 80 toothpicks.
   - Weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount percentage from the original price to the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold to his friend} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage from the original price to the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend paid $1800. The discount is:

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The discount percentage is:

\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex ate is half of the total meat on the triceratops. This means that the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

Thus, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to calculate the mean height of the heels worn by the women. 

First, let's determine the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we add these totals to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we divide this total height by the number of women to find the average height:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ women}} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"First, let's clarify the names and the distribution of the apples. The problem mentions Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, but then refers to Peter and James. I will assume Peter and Pierre are the same person, and James is Jacques.

The total weight of apples is 12 kg.

Pierre (Peter) wants a quarter of the apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \, \text{kg} = 3 \, \text{kg} \]

Paul wants a third of the apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \, \text{kg} = 4 \, \text{kg} \]

The total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul is:
\[ \text{Total taken} = 3 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 7 \, \text{kg} \]

The remaining apples for Jacques (James) are:

"To determine how much money Raymond has left, we need to follow the transactions step by step:

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He saved $11 from his allowance, so we add this to his initial amount:
   \[
   21 + 11 = 32
   \]
3. Raymond then spent $5 on a comic book, so we subtract this from his current total:
   \[
   32 - 5 = 27
   \]
4. Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract this from his current total:
   \[
   27 - 19 = 8

"To determine the cost of each book, we first need to calculate how much money Anna spent on the books today. 

1. Anna's initial budget was $16.
2. She has already spent $4 before buying the books.
3. She has $2 left in her budget after buying the books.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Anna has spent so far:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \text{Initial budget} - \text{Remaining budget} \]
\[ \text{Total spent} = 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we determine how much she spent on the books today:
\[ \text{Spent on books} = \text{Total spent} - \text{Amount already spent} \]
\[ \text{Spent on books} = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since Anna bought 2 books and both books cost the same amount, we divide the total amount spent on books by 2:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{\text{Spent on books}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to reach his parents' house.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - One-way distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Since John makes a round trip, the total distance for one visit is twice the one-way distance.
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for the month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many miles Brian will walk:

\[ \text{Distance Sofie walks} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

Substituting the distance Sofie walks:

\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

Solving for the distance Brian walks:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks} = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

"To determine the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.
2. Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.
3. Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find the production rate of the fifth worker.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.

- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Total toys produced by the first 4 workers:
  \[
  120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.

- The manufacturer needs 400 toys, but still needs 20 toys after the shift:
  \[
  400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift is 380 toys.

### Step 3: Use the information to find the production rate of the fifth worker.

- Total toys produced by the fifth worker in one 10-hour shift:
  \[
  380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Production rate of the fifth worker per hour:
  \[
  \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
  \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth originally had.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris, so Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
6. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).

Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and this is equal to 16, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking the 3 miles, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. Therefore, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using her speed on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ \text{Amount saved so far} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60.

\[ \text{Amount needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28.

\[ \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. 

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of the marbles he has. We can calculate this by subtracting 10 from 36:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug such that the mixture in Donny's water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The volume of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces.
- The volume of water from the second mug is 1 ounce.

The total volume of water in the water bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[
T_{\text{mixture}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5}
\]

We know that \( T_{\text{mixture}} \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T_2 \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 \geq 68
\]

Thus, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we first calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the discount applied, and then divide that total by the number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00
   \]

2. Apply the 10% discount:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost with discount} = \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. Calculate the cost per bagel:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller, manageable parts and then combine the results.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed for a certain number of scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
   - \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

   Therefore, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}
     \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women initially on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 parts (5 parts men + 9 parts women), there are 84 passengers in total.

First, we calculate the value of one part:
\[ \text{Total parts} = 5 + 9 = 14 \]
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Next, we calculate the number of men and women:
\[ \text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles required to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many bottles are currently produced.
3. Find the difference between the required number of bottles and the current production.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles required

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

### Step 2: Determine the current production

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

### Step 3: Find the difference

The number of additional bottles needed is:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

2. **Determine the number of babies wearing bows:**
   - All 2 babies in blue wear bows.
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 6 babies in purple wear bows:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ babies in purple wearing bows}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies wearing bows:**
   - Total babies wearing bows = babies in blue wearing bows + babies in purple wearing bows:

   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]
   Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces:
   \[
   1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year from year 5 to year 10:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as \( R \), \( B \), and \( Y \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, substitute \( B = 5 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Amount Left in Ronnie's Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount left in Ronnie's money is:
\[
2

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. The mural is composed of four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. Red, white, and purple are present in equal amounts.
3. Half of the mural is yellow.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, let's determine the amount of yellow paint used. Since half of the mural is yellow:
\[ \text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Next, we need to find out how much paint is used for the remaining colors (red, white, and purple). The total amount of paint used for these three colors is:
\[ \text{Total paint for red, white, and purple} = 12 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since red, white, and purple are present in equal amounts, we divide the remaining paint equally among these three colors:
\[ \text{Red paint} = \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:
\[ 2 \text{ pints} \]

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then sum these areas.

1. **Area of one bedroom:**
   - Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet.
   - Area of one bedroom = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

2. **Total area of the bedrooms:**
   - Tom has 4 bedrooms.
   - Total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

3. **Area of the living room:**
   - The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
   - Area of the living room = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

4. **Area of the rest of the house:**
   - The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

5. **Total area of the house:**
   - Total area = Area of the bedrooms + Area of the living room + Area of the rest of the house
   - Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She counts double the number from Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She counts double the number from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She counts double the number from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She counts double the number from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of puffs counted each day:

\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

20% of 100 pods is:
\[ 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12, and it contains 120 pods. To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1, we need to determine the cost per pod and then find out how many pods $1 can buy.

The cost per pod in the special size box is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, for $1, you can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Since each pod runs one dishwashing cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 to $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: 5 inches
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Chalk Remaining After Monday**:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use 20% of the remaining chalk each day before the chalk is less than 2 inches.

4. **Chalk Used Each Day**: 20% of the remaining chalk
5. **Chalk Remaining Each Day**: 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk

We will calculate the remaining chalk day by day until it is less than 2 inches.

- **Day 1 (Tuesday)**:
  \[
  2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
  \]
- **Day 2 (Wednesday)**:
  \[
  2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs**: Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour.
2. **Rate of melting snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

Therefore, the net rate of snowball accumulation per hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ (made)} - 8 \text{ (melted)} = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

We need to find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Using the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour, we can set up the equation:
\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - Had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Now, let's determine the initial number of bandages they started with. We know they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + \text{Total ordered} - \text{Total used} = 78 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 150 - 91 = 78 \]

Solving for the initial bandages:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 59 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 59 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 19 \]

Thus, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant at different times of the day and then sum these numbers.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. This means \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (in the morning) entered the restaurant. This means \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered.

Now, we sum all these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pens Alain's mom bought, considering both the red and black pens.

1. First, determine the number of red pens:
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens is \(5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}\).

2. Next, determine the number of black pens:
   - Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens.
   - Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) packs of black pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of black pens is \(10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}\).

3. Finally, calculate the total number of pens:
   - Total pens = number of red pens + number of black pens
   - Total pens = 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is 75.

"To determine the total amount John spends, we first need to calculate the cost per bottle of scotch and then use that to find the cost per bottle of cognac, and finally, the total cost of the cognac.

1. **Cost per bottle of scotch:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles of scotch}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Number of bottles of cognac:**
   \[
   \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20
   \]

3. **Cost per bottle of cognac:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 50\% \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total cost of cognac:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total amount spent:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of scotch} + \text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and calculate the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

1. **Mattison's height**: 60 inches.
2. **Height of the house**: 7 times Mattison's height.
   \[
   \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Height of the first floor ceiling**: 3 times Mattison's height.
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor ceiling} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

The height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors. Since the first floor ceiling is 180 inches high, the remaining height for the second floor is:
\[
\text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor ceiling}
\]
\[
\text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 240 inches.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance is given as 3 miles per day for 4 dogs. Therefore, the total distance walked by all dogs combined is:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Average distance} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

We know the distances for the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these distances gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price (CP) of the magazines is $72. 

The selling price (SP) is given as 11/8 of the cost price. Therefore, we calculate the selling price as follows:
\[ \text{SP} = \frac{11}{8} \times \text{CP} \]
\[ \text{SP} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]
\[ \text{SP} = 11 \times 9 \]
\[ \text{SP} = 99 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) represent the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats:
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can start by setting up the relationships given in the problem with equations. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem:
- Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.
- Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, Samantha has \( (K + 8) - 12 \) paintings.

We can set up the equation based on the information about Samantha:
\[ (K + 8) - 12 = 27 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( K \):
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

"To determine the final price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.
2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]
3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price then decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36

Next, we calculate the time for each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**: 
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both parts of the journey to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is:

"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to calculate how many boxes of popsicle sticks he will need and then find the total cost.

1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of sticks per box:
   \[
   \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box:
   \[
   7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the cost of the main phone: $20.
2. Determine the cost of each additional phone. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.
3. Calculate the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost for these is 4 * $10 = $40.
4. Add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones to get the total cost of the phone plan: $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60.

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed.**

Time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by the speaking speed.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower based on the given percentage increase.

1. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, the number of seeds in a small sunflower is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds}
   \]

2. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we calculate 50% of 36 and add it to 36:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 36 = 0.5 \times 36 = 18
   \]
   \[
   36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds}
   \]

3. To find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds from both:
   \[
   36 + 54 = 90
   \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds is:
90"

"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal.
- The first T-shirt is at the full price: $8.
- The second T-shirt is at 50% off: $8 * 0.5 = $4.
- The total cost for the T-shirts is: $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off.
- The discount amount is: $40 * 0.4 = $16.
- The price after the discount is: $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we sum the costs of the T-shirts and the shoes:

"First, let's calculate how much allowance Ryan has earned over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, we multiply $6 by 3:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, which is 4 ice cream cones in total. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Finally, we determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we divide $13 by $6.50:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Let's break down the information given:

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron did. Therefore, Aaron ran 2 miles.
3. Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Vanessa's speed is \( v \) miles per minute, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \) miles per minute.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we calculate Aaron's speed:
- Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- Speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

Since Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed:
- Vanessa's speed = 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

Now, we calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
- Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   C + K = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2C + 4K = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   C + 2K = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
   \[
   C + K = 20
   \]
   \[
   C + 2K = 35
   \]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( C \):
   \[
   (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   K = 15
   \]

Now substitute \( K = 15 \) back into the first equation:
   \[
   C + 15 = 20

   \[
   C = 5
   \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
