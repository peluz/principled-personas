"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue bolts)} + 1 \text{ (white bolt)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts needed is:

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times \$80,000 = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000
   \]

2. Calculate the new value of the house:
   \[
   \text{New value} = \text{Original value} + \text{Increase in value} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including repairs:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Original purchase price} + \text{Cost of repairs} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
   \]

4. Calculate the profit:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000
   \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[
\$70,000

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one session:
   - He runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters.
   - So, in one session, he runs \(3 \times 60 = 180\) meters.

2. Calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
   - He runs 3 times a week.
   - So, in a week, he runs \(3 \times 180 = 540\) meters.

Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is 540 meters.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day for her flock of 20 chickens.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, for 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to account for the feed already given during the morning and afternoon meals:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.

The total amount of feed given by the end of the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses where every second glass is 60% of the price, we can break down the purchase into pairs of glasses. Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.

1. The cost of one full-price glass is $5.
2. The cost of one discounted glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

For each pair of glasses, the total cost is:
$5 (full price) + $3 (discounted price) = $8.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, he is buying 8 pairs of glasses. The total cost for 8 pairs is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

\[20 + 80 + 160 = 260\]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken for Carla to download the 200 GB file, considering the interruption and the need to restart the download.

1. **Calculate the time taken to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Add the time taken for the Windows update:**
   - The update takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the entire file again:**
   - Since the download restarts from the beginning, the time to download the full 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \) minutes.

4. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Time to download 40% of the file: 40 minutes
   - Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
   - Time to download the full file again: 100 minutes

   Total time = 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return journey is 4 hours and 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours have already passed), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Journey:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

1. Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:
   - Regular hourly rate = $10
   - Regular hours worked = 40
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Calculate the overtime pay for the additional 5 hours:
   - Overtime hourly rate = 1.2 * regular hourly rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12
   - Overtime hours worked = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. Calculate the total earnings for the week:
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:** The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month:** The number of downloads was three times the first month, which is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) downloads.
3. **Third Month:** The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. A 30% reduction means the program retained 70% of the second month's downloads. So, the downloads in the third month are \(180 \times 0.70 = 126\).

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Income from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Income} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

**Total Profit After \( n \) Years**:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = \text{Net Annual Profit} \times n - \text{Initial Cost} \]
\[ \text{Total Profit} = 7.5n - 90 \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the total profit is greater than or equal to zero:
\[ 7.5n - 90 \geq 0 \]
\[ 7.5n \geq 90 \]
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.

3. After selling at the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

6. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. Solving the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Taken} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum these amounts after accounting for the spill.

1. **Calculate the water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
   - Water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

2. **Account for the spill:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining orange drink is 9 liters.
   - The remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
   - Water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

4. **Sum the water from both drinks:**
   - Total water in the mixture = Water from the orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. So, Raymond's current age is:

31 (Samantha's age) + 6 (years older than Samantha) = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age:

37 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when his son was born) = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the problem using the formula for calculating the discounted price:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - (\text{Discount Rate} \times \text{Original Price}) \]

Given that the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount rate is 25% (or 0.25 in decimal form), we can rewrite the formula as:

\[ 19.50 = \text{Original Price} - (0.25 \times \text{Original Price}) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 19.50 = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - 0.25) \]
\[ 19.50 = \text{Original Price} \times 0.75 \]

To find the original price, we divide both sides by 0.75:

\[ \text{Original Price} = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ \text{Original Price} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and then subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk at $3 each is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples at $1.50 each is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 (total) - $33 (other items) = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings consumed in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will eat:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons needed is:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break down the trip into segments based on the information provided:

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means he stopped at the 45-mile mark (60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles).

The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance at which he made the second stop and the distance at which he made the first stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age by \( D \) and Allen's age by \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We also know that the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D \) from the ratio equation into the sum equation:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to determine what each friend guessed.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = 80 \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S = 40 \)), we can find the number of gold coins (\( G \)):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \). Therefore, Aaron has \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.

2. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has \( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels.

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

Now, we add the points from both periods to get the total:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Total points scored: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time spent running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know the total distance he runs each week is 60 miles.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on the information given about her skipping speed.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running: \( 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking: \( 1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \).

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance: \( 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We know that one serving of chips is 250 calories and the 300g bag has 5 servings. Therefore, each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since 250 calories are in 60g of chips, we can calculate the number of grams that contain 200 calories:

(200 calories / 250 calories) * 60g = 48g

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax.
   - He wants to make 20 candles.
   - Number of pounds of beeswax needed = 20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total cost of beeswax and wicks:**
   - Cost per pound of beeswax and wicks = $10.00.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Selling price per candle = $2.00.
   - Total revenue for 20 candles = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

4. **Calculate the net profit:**

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and then bought a package, which we'll call \( x \) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she started with and the ones she bought. The total number of Post-it notes she used plus the ones she had left should equal this sum.

So, the equation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 23 + 220 - 80 \]
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the package that Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to get the total amount spent on ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he covers is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes him to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 pounds * (2 toys/pound) = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

   \( \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \)

2. Calculate the total number of students:
   \( \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \)

3. Determine the number of teachers:
   We know there are 5 students for every teacher, so:
   \( \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \)

Therefore, the number of teachers is 36.

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of money she received over the 8 weeks from her final total.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has $100. This total includes her initial amount plus the $40 she received over the 8 weeks. To find her initial amount, we subtract the $40 from the final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches, the total number of students, and then multiply by the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So for 5 days, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Next, we calculate the total number of students:
- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, that's 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money Judy makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, that's 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

Therefore, Judy makes $7,425.00 in one week.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level, given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it and the top level has a square footage of 16.

Let's denote the square footage of the levels from top to bottom as \( L_1, L_2, L_3, \) and \( L_4 \).

Given:
- \( L_1 = 16 \) (top level)
- \( L_2 = 2 \times L_1 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \)
- \( L_3 = 2 \times L_2 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \)
- \( L_4 = 2 \times L_3 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \) (bottom level)

Now, we calculate the total square footage of all levels:
\[ \text{Total square footage} = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 + L_4 = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage per level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{\text{Total square footage}}{\text{Number of levels}} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water:
   \[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:
   \[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

3. The boy received 6 liters of water.

4. Now, calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy:
   \[ \text{Total water taken} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

5. Finally, subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left:

"Let's denote the number of games won as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive over the next three years, starting from the point where she has completed five years of service.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7200

Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she is eligible for a 10% increase in her salary.

3. **Salary after 5 years (First increase)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $600 + (10% of $600) = $600 + $60 = $660
   - New Annual Salary: $660 * 12 = $7920

4. **Salary after 6 years (Second increase)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726
   - New Annual Salary: $726 * 12 = $8712

5. **Salary after 7 years (Third increase)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
   - New Annual Salary: $798.60 * 12 = $9583.20

6. **Salary after 8 years (Fourth increase)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $798.60 + (10% of $798.60) = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

"To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed based on the attendance.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend. Christina invited 16 friends, so:
\[ \text{Number of attendees} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of gift bags needed.
Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest, so:
\[ \text{Number of gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.
Each gift bag costs $2, so:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.

\[ \text{Total potato salad for adults} = 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10 \, \text{lbs}}{2} = 5 \, \text{lbs} \).
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.

\[ \text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:

\[ \text{Total potato salad needed} = 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
3. James is 10 years old.
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey.

From point 4, we can determine Corey's age:
- If James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, then Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

From point 2, we can determine Amy's age:
- If Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, and Corey is 11, then Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

From point 1, we can determine Jackson's age:
- If Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, and Amy is 9, then Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how fast Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and that he used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. This means that before the diet change, Gerald's time was:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run the same distance in 90% of his original time. Therefore, his new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

Step 1: Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
Since the volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked into sauce, the original volume of tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 2: Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total original volume by the volume of one can:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Step 3: Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.
Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left in the line is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we add up all the doorbell presses:

- First friend: 20 times

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and before bed every weekday. That's 4 glasses of water per weekday. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks:

4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but has a soda with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day on Saturday and Sunday. So for the weekend, he drinks:

3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses

Adding the weekday and weekend totals together:

20 glasses (weekdays) + 6 glasses (weekends) = 26 glasses

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given rate of the fog's movement and the total distance it needs to cover.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes to cover 42 miles, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{42 \text{ miles} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]

\[ x = \frac{420 \text{ minutes}}{3} \]

\[ x = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. First, determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, we calculate:
   \[ \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy has placed her pieces:
   \[ \text{Remaining pieces after Poppy} = 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

3. Poppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. We calculate the number of pieces her mom places:
   \[ \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

4. Finally, we calculate how many pieces are left to be placed after her mom has placed her pieces:
   \[ \text{Remaining pieces after mom} = 750 - 250 = 500 \]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume for all boxes.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions (1 inch from each side).

Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume of one box = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * 3
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and then solve for Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) 30-minute episodes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5, so before dropping them, he had:
   110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

2. The 115 cookies are 15 more than he intended to bake, so the number of cookies he intended to bake is:
   115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

3. He intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, so the number of cookies he baked last year is:
   100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use that to find out the total amount of water that entered the boat.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed by setting up a proportion:

\[ \text{Distance rowed} = \left(\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} \]

\[ \text{Distance rowed} = \left(\frac{20}{16}\right) \times 64 \]

\[ \text{Distance rowed} = 1.25 \times 64 \]

\[ \text{Distance rowed} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can now calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} \]

\[ \text{Water taken on} = 0.2 \times 80 \]

\[ \text{Water taken on} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.

2. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.
   - Let \( d \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50d \).

3. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - \( d = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new price, which is 50% higher than the original price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the lumber:
- Total cost = $100 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180

Next, we calculate the selling price of each type of board, which is 50% higher than the original price:
- Selling price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 * 1.50 = $15 each
- Selling price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $16 * 1.50 = $24 each

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:
- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120

Total revenue = $150 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the total amount of sugar and water and the ratio of sugar to water.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We can set up the following proportion to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used:

\[
\text{Total parts} = 20
\]
\[
\text{Total mixture} = 120 \text{ units}
\]
\[
\text{Teaspoons of sugar} = \left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 120

   \[
   2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

2. **Total Vehicles After Second Day**: After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port is 30.

3. **Vehicles Added on the Second Day**: The number of vehicles added on the second day is the difference between the total number of vehicles after the second day and the number of vehicles on the first day:
   \[
   30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

4. **Number of Containers on the Second Day**: Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than what he was making four years ago.
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \).
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 40,000 + 16,000 \).
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
   - The percentage increase for Adrien is 40%.
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \).
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \).
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary.
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 \).
   - Total salary = \( 99,076.92 \).

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of sheets Miguel uses per week.
2. Calculate the number of weeks in a month.
3. Multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month.

Step 1: Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets.
So, the number of sheets he uses per week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Step 2: On average, a month has about 4.33 weeks (52 weeks in a year divided by 12 months).

Step 3: Now, we multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month:
60 sheets/week * 4.33 weeks/month ≈ 259.8 sheets/month

Since we typically don't count partial sheets of paper, we can round this to the nearest whole number.

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in the given time for each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \( 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \).

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

For the second test:
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \( 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \).

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine which items are nonfood and then apply the 10% tax to those items. Milk and eggs are food items, so they are not taxed. The nonfood items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items before tax:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

The tax on the nonfood items is 10% of $10:
Tax: $10 * 0.10 = $1

The total cost of the nonfood items after tax:
Total cost of nonfood items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

The total cost of all items:
Total cost: $5 (food) + $11 (nonfood with tax) = $16

"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine his total expenses and subtract them from his total income.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8

Next, we calculate the total expenses for these 8 clients:
- Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of bleach per client: 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4
- Cost of cloths per client: 1 pack * $5/pack = $5
- Total cost per client: $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9

Total expenses for 8 clients:
- Total expenses: 8 clients * $9/client = $72

Now, we subtract the total expenses from the total income to find the profit:
- Total income: $92
- Total expenses: $72
- Profit: $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees at each stage:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. This includes the 30 bees that left initially and the 60 bees that left later, minus the 15 bees that had already returned.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \]

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance to home in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance to home in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home by dividing the distance by the speed.

Steve's time to get home:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time to get home:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time, which is how long the winner will be waiting, is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

Converting cents to dollars, 500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to the original number. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Final fries left:** 5 fries.
2. **Ants carried off 1 fry:** Before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:** If the raccoon stole two-thirds, then one-third was left. So, the 6 fries represent one-third of the fries before the raccoon took them. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(6 \times 3 = 18\) fries.
4. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:** The pigeons ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. So, before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:** Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. Therefore, before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. **Dave ate 14 fries:** Before Dave, there were \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on each type of day:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**: Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long.
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays**: Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long.
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all the days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total class hours for the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).
- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each way (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).
- She does this 34 times.
- Total distance for the 40-yard line runs: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Adding the initial 100-yard run: \( 2720 + 100 = 2820 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.
- Kelly's total distance: 2820 yards.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase rate:**
   - Initial price = $20
   - Increase rate = 20% of the original price

2. **Determine the number of price increases:**
   - 36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

3. **Calculate the price after each increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Therefore, each new price is the previous price plus $4.

4. **Formulate the price increase as a multiplication factor:**
   - A 20% increase can be represented as multiplying the current price by 1.20 (since 100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20).

5. **Apply the multiplication factor for each of the 18 increases:**
   - Final price = Initial price * (1.20)^18

6. **Calculate the final price:**
   - Final price = $20 * (1.20)^18

Using a calculator to compute (1.20)^18:
   - (1.20)^18 ≈ 38.3376

Therefore:
   - Final price = $20 * 38.3376 ≈ $766.752

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $766.75.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider the different distances he walks on weekdays and weekends.

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), he walks 20 miles each day. There are 5 weekdays, so the total distance for weekdays is:
  \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \)

- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. There are 2 weekend days, so the total distance for weekends is:
  \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \)

Adding the distances for weekdays and weekends gives us the total distance for the week:
\( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \)

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of the uniform:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

"To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then find 50% more than that amount. Finally, we multiply the increased monthly payment by 12 to get the annual total.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500
   Increased monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the annual payment:
   Annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

"To determine the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

1. **Time to peel one potato:** 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds)
2. **Time to cut one potato:** 5 seconds

First, we calculate the total time to peel all 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 90 \text{ seconds/potato} = 5400 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we calculate the total time to cut all 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds/potato} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we add the two times together to get the total prep time:
\[ 5400 \text{ seconds} + 300 \text{ seconds} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find out the total cost.
4. Calculate the cost of lemons based on the total cost.

First, let's find out how many gallons of lemonade they sold. Since they made a profit of $25, we need to know their total revenue and total cost.

The profit formula is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]

Given:
- Profit = $25
- Cost per gallon (lemons + sugar) = $3 + $2 = $5
- Revenue per glass = $0.50
- Glasses per gallon = 20

Let \( x \) be the number of gallons they sold. The total revenue from selling \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20 \times x = 10x \]

The total cost for \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5x \]

Using the profit formula:
\[ 25 = 10x - 5x \]
\[ 25 = 5x \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they sold 5 gallons of lemonade.

The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down Zaid's expenses and calculate the remaining amount step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to family} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the final remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours at the same rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received. The winner got 3/4 of the votes. Since the total number of votes cast was 80, we calculate the winner's votes as follows:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes

Let's do the math:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80 = 60

Loser's votes = 80 - 60 = 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20.

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( C \).

From the information given:
\[ 200 = 5C \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses ordered is:
\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, we need to find out how old Jan was two years ago:
Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Next, we use the information that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2 * 28) + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find out how old Mark is now:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark:
Jean's current age = 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
     \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

4. **Expressing the likelihood as a percentage:**
   - To express this as a percentage, we convert the ratio to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

Thus, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. Rats are in 3 cages, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each with one hamster, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
3. There is a pen of rabbits that gets 20 pieces of straw.
4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed.

First, calculate the total straw used for the hamsters and rabbits:

- Hamsters: 10 cages * 1 hamster/cage * 5 pieces of straw/hamster = 50 pieces of straw
- Rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, subtract this from the total straw distributed to find out how much straw was used for the rats:

160 pieces of straw (total) - 70 pieces of straw (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw (rats)

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total straw for rats by the straw per rat:

90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw/rat = 15 rats

Since the rats are equally distributed among 3 cages, the number of rats per cage is:

15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 2\% = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Plugging in the values:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) be the number of bags the trader bought and sold.

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: \( 20x \) dollars.
2. **Cost of transporting the bags**: \( 2x \) dollars.
3. **Total cost**: \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.
4. **Revenue from selling the bags**: \( 30x \) dollars.
5. **Profit**: Revenue - Total cost = \( 30x - 22x = 8x \) dollars.

We know the trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 8x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: They spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees Tom plants each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees.

Step 1: Net number of trees planted each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees he adds each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, and adding 8 trees each year for 10 years, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Final number of trees
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times the initial number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and then calculate the earnings from each publisher.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, we get:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year by multiplying the number of acres by the tons of grapes produced per acre.
2. Calculate the total barrels of wine produced by multiplying the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels of wine produced per ton of grapes.

Let's do the math:

1. Total tons of grapes = 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons
2. Total barrels of wine = 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down the problem into parts:

1. **Cheese used in sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese used for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Cheese used in omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese used for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Cheese used in macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese.

Now, we add up all the cheese used:
- Cheese in sandwiches: 14 slices
- Cheese in omelets: 9 slices
- Cheese in macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Total cheese used: \( 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 \text{ slices} \).

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to average 93.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total score needed for the remaining five tests to average 93:
- The formula for the average is: (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)
- We want the average of the five highest scores to be 93.
- Therefore, the total score needed for the five highest scores is: 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we need to find the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
- Scores (excluding the lowest score of 71): 89, 92, 100, 86
- Sum of these scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. The total score of the five highest tests will be:
- 367 + \( x \)

We set up the equation:
- 367 + \( x \) = 465

Solving for \( x \):
- \( x \) = 465 - 367
- \( x \) = 98

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we can break the problem into two parts: the distance he rode in the first four weeks and the distance he rode in the following three weeks.

1. For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides \(125 \times 4 = 500\) kilometers.

2. For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides \(120 \times 3 = 360\) kilometers.

Adding the distances from both periods gives us the total distance:
- Total distance = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40 grams/chocolate bar = 1000 grams

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20 grams/candied apple = 1600 grams

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000 grams (chocolate bars) + 1600 grams (candied apples) = 2600 grams

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought after all three days, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we add up the cakes bought on each day to get the total number of cakes:

- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes bought = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Total cost for 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups means 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
   - Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then figure out how much more money she needs after considering her current savings and the money she earns from babysitting.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:**
   - Jacket: $30
   - 2 pairs of shoes: 2 * $20 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. **Determine how much money Sara already has:**
   - Initial savings: $10
   - Money earned from babysitting: 4 times * $5 = $20
   - Total current savings: $10 + $20 = $30

3. **Calculate the additional amount of money Sara needs:**
   - Total cost: $70
   - Current savings: $30
   - Additional money needed: $70 - $30 = $40

4. **Determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional money:**
   - Money earned per lawn mowed: $4
   - Number of times she needs to mow the lawn: $40 / $4 = 10

Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs produced by the red chickens each day is \( 3R \) (since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day), and the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens each day is \( 5W \) (since each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day).

The equation for the total number of eggs collected each day is:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length (L) = 6 miles
- Width (W) = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance Gary walks is 15 miles. To find out how long it takes him to walk this distance, we use the formula for time (T), which is:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour, we can calculate the time:

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers (from the first day) + 50 more customers = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days: 500 customers.
4. Subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total to find the number of customers on the third day: 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 customers.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 250.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons).
Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons).

We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, each pool had 16 gallons more water (since 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).

So, 4 minutes ago:
- The big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.
- The small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's current age.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is twice Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we first need to determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the information given.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we can calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points of the other three students from the overall total:
- Jojo's points: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes her 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes her 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen.

25 + 5 + 1 = 31

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students who left through each exit and then determine the number who left through exit C.

1. First, calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:
   - 30% of 1000 students = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

2. Subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total to find the remaining students:
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
   - 3/5 of the remaining 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

4. Subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number who went out through exit C:
   - 700 - 420 = 280 students

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pen pals Mike is currently writing to:
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped writing to 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he is now writing to \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. Determine the number of letters Mike receives each week:
   - Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.

3. Calculate the total number of pages Mike receives each week:
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages a week.

4. Determine the number of pages Mike writes in response:
   - Mike responds in kind, so he writes 30 pages a week.

5. Calculate the time Mike spends writing each week:
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

6. Convert the time spent writing from minutes to hours:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin now has:
   \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is:
   \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   So, Griffin now has:
   \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took, which is:
   \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   So, Griffin now has:
   \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) fries.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \( x \). Therefore:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Step 1: Daily cost
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours each day.
Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours/day = $1500/day

Step 2: Weekly cost
The makeup is needed 4 times a week.
Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days/week = $6000/week

Step 3: Total cost for 5 weeks
Total cost = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000

Step 4: Apply the 10% discount
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in all three bags:
300 (first bag) + 312 (second bag) + 150 (third bag) = 762 M&Ms.

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house:
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

2. Add the additional windows in one house:
   - Each house has 4 additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows in one house is \(6 + 4 = 10\).

3. Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2:
   - Total windows in both houses is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the body, so it takes \(900 / 10 = 90\) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
- The total number of stitches for the entire sweater is 1800.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[ 630 \text{ stitches} / 2 = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice as many as a mamba, we can find the number of spots a mamba has by dividing the number of spots a cobra has by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots of cobras and mambas to get the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, we add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows to find the total number of stars accounted for:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars per row:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand how the pages are arranged on each sheet of paper. In a typical tabloid format, each sheet of paper, when folded, will have four pages: two on the front and two on the back.

Here's the breakdown:
- One sheet of paper can hold 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back).
- For a 32-page tabloid, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each sheet can hold.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \text{Number of sheets} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per sheet}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 8.

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year and then multiply that number by the price per book.

First, let's find out how many books she sold in total over the three years. Since there are 50 unsold books out of the original 250, she has sold:

250 books - 50 unsold books = 200 sold books

We know that in the current year (the third year), she sold 45 books. We also know that in the first year, she sold twice as many books as in the third year. So, in the first year, she sold:

2 * 45 books = 90 books

Now, we can calculate how many books were sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold:

200 sold books - 90 books (first year) - 45 books (third year) = 65 books (second year)

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:

"To calculate Watson's earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus, given that the company performed well for the entire month.

1. **Calculate the weekly earnings from hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours per week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week
   - Earnings from hourly wage per week = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

2. **Calculate the total weekly earnings including the bonus:**
   - Since the company performed well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
   - Total weekly earnings = $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week

3. **Determine the number of weeks in April:**
   - April typically has 4 weeks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings for April = 4 weeks * $800/week = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total loaves produced each day**: 60 loaves.
2. **Loaves sold in the morning**: Two-thirds of the total loaves.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. **Loaves remaining after the morning sales**:
   \[
   \text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. **Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening**: Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. **Loaves sold in the afternoon**:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We can calculate this by dividing the total weight Sandy wants to lose by her weekly weight loss:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the savings on the ice cream and the milk separately and then add them together.

1. Savings on ice cream:
   - Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
   - New price of one tub of ice cream: $11
   - Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
   - Total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4

2. Savings on milk:
   - Discount per packet of milk: $0.5
   - Total savings for 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over a period of fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **New Arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ new arms}
     \]

2. **New Legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ new legs}
     \]

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ new arms} + 3 \text{ new legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first need to determine the daily egg consumption and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

There are 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

The total daily consumption is:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily total by 7:
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

"To find out how old Trent is, we can start by determining Jane's age based on Quinn's age. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30 years old, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane is 27 years old, we can find out how old Trent is. Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) (twice as many as on the defense).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \) (half the number on the defense).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find out how many people show up for Martha's party, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which totals:
   \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.

2. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which totals:
   \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

3. Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:
   \(12 + 12 = 24\) people.

4. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so we subtract these from the total:
   \(24 - 8 = 16\) people.

5. 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. This is:
   \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

6. Subtracting these 2 people from the 16 who were still expected to come:
   \(16 - 2 = 14\) people.

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, therefore, has \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The smallest group has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals based on the information provided:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself, we add up all the weights:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June after taking his coach's advice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run each day as per his coach's advice.
2. Add this additional distance to his original daily distance to get the new daily distance.
3. Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June to get the total distance for the month.

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance.
The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. So, the additional distance is:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Calculate the new daily distance.
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance for June.
June has 30 days, so:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

The discount is 40%, so the discount amount on the total cost is:
40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Davos paid:
$60 - $24 = $36

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows at 2 hours each) is 30% of his total vacation time.

First, calculate the total time spent watching shows:
3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

Since this is 30% of his total vacation time, we can set up the equation:
6 hours = 0.30 * Total Time

Solving for Total Time:
Total Time = 6 hours / 0.30
Total Time = 20 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his total vacation time was spent sightseeing. We can calculate the time spent sightseeing as follows:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day, and finally determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. **Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second and then to the third is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than this combined distance: 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip is the sum of the distances between all three cities: 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes 3 trips a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.

4. **Determine how many days the train can operate before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can operate, we divide the service interval by the daily distance: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the amount of milk from the first half of the sheep.
2. Calculate the amount of milk from the second half of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep in total. Half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk per sheep. So, the total milk from the first half is:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

From the second half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk per sheep. So, the total milk from the second half is:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Now, we add the milk from both halves to get the total amount of milk collected every day:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of pupils in the class**: 40
2. **Number of pupils who like blue**: Half of the class likes blue, so:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. **Number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for**:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20
   \]
4. **Number of pupils who like green**: One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so:
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
5. **Number of pupils who like yellow**: The rest of the pupils like yellow, so:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, let's break down the information given:

1. Lucy sells apples at $4 each.
2. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked and earned $56. To find out how many apples she sold, we divide the total earnings by the price per apple:
   \[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4} = 14 \text{ apples} \]
3. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
4. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:
   \[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day:
\[ \text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and then subtract that from the total number of socks that needed washing.

Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since a pair consists of 2 socks, she has washed:
10 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 20 socks

She also washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
20 socks + 15 socks = 35 socks

There were 50 socks that needed washing, so the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
50 socks - 35 socks = 15 socks

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then the total amount to be repaid, which includes both the principal and the interest. After that, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is annual, we need to convert the time into years:
   \[
   \text{Time in years} = \frac{5 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months/year}} = \frac{5}{12} \text{ years}
   \]
   Now, calculate the interest:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 152.08
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Number of months}} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month.

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
3. Calculate the total profit by subtracting the cost of supplies from the total revenue.
4. Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.
5. Calculate the profit per hour.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade.**

Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.**

Each cup is sold for $1:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar/cup} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total profit.**

The cost of supplies is $18:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost of supplies} \]
\[ \text{Total profit} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 18 \text{ dollars} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.**

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total number of cups}}{\text{Cups sold per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit per hour.**

\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Total time}} \]
\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{18 \text{ dollars}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing, and half of them can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls performing = 26 / 2 = 13

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Total number of people performing = 13 + 3 = 16

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ride ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

Now, we find the difference in cost between Dasha's total and David's total:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30
- The amount David saves is \(36 - 30 = 6\) dollars.

Therefore, David saves:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number by the sum of the parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract that from the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix**: $10 per month.
2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**:
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the discount is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
   - With a 20% discount, the savings on the bundle is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the discounted cost for the bundle is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services**:
   - Netflix: $10
   - Hulu and Disney Plus bundle: $16
   - Total: $10 + $16 = $26 per month.

4. **Savings**:
   - Cost of cable package: $60 per month.
   - Cost of streaming services: $26 per month.
   - Savings: $60 - $26 = $34 per month.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing her song out of the total work time, we first need to calculate the total time spent on all activities and then determine the proportion of that time spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Next, we calculate the total time spent on all activities:
Total time = Time writing + Time recording + Time editing
Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total time = 7.5 hours

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total time that was spent editing:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time editing / Total time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had and then subtract the number of cards she passed out and add the number of cards she received.

1. Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
3. The total number of cards Erica had initially is 20 (made) + 30 (pre-made) = 50 cards.
4. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
5. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, we subtract the number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had and then add the number of cards she received:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pizza has 12 slices in total.
2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since 1/3 of 12 is 4, Bill gets 4 slices.
3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since 1/4 of 12 is 3, Mark gets 3 slices.
4. Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away and eaten:
- Slices given to Bill: 4
- Slices given to Mark: 3
- Slices eaten by Jenny: 2

Total slices given away and eaten: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts (or 0.9 kilowatts) per hour.
   - If Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     0.9 \, \text{kW} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7.2 \, \text{kWh}
     \]

2. Calculate the reduced daily energy consumption:
   - If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]
   - The reduced daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     0.9 \, \text{kW} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2.7 \, \text{kWh}
     \]

3. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original and reduced daily energy consumption:
     \[
     7.2 \, \text{kWh} - 2.7 \, \text{kWh} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh}
     \]

4. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - The total energy savings over 30 days is:
     \[
     4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kWh}
     \]

Thus, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Adding the cost of the meat and the cheese together gives us the total cost:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, we account for the additional items Allan bought:

3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he bought is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, we add the new corns to the initial number of corns:

5. The new total number of corns is \(80 + 60 = 140\).

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis:

6. The combined total is \(140 + 100 = 240\).

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 5,000 steps. Additionally, he took 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend. This brings the total number of steps he has taken so far to:

5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000 steps.

Elliott has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal after his jog. This means that before his jog, he had:

10,000 (goal) - 2,000 (left) = 8,000 steps.

Since he had already taken 6,000 steps before the jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is:

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and then add the time it takes to get to the airport. We can then subtract this total time from the 60 minutes he has before he needs to be at the airport.

1. Calculate the total number of words in the book:
   \[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

2. Calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book:
   \[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Add the time it takes to get to the airport:
   \[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

4. Subtract the total time from the 60 minutes he has:
   \[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to break down the payments for each month and then sum them up.

### May:
- Number of employees: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

First, calculate the weekly pay for one employee:
\[ \text{Weekly pay per employee} = 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Next, calculate the monthly pay for one employee:
\[ \text{Monthly pay per employee} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, calculate the total pay for all employees in May:
\[ \text{Total pay in May} = 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

### June:
- Number of employees at the start of June: 40
- Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees remaining: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

Using the same pay rate and hours, calculate the weekly pay for one employee:
\[ \text{Weekly pay per employee} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Next, calculate the monthly pay for one employee:
\[ \text{Monthly pay per employee} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, calculate the total pay for the remaining employees in June:
\[ \text{Total pay in June} = 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Total Pay for Both Months:
\[ \text{Total pay for May and June} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of Purchases:**
   - Total cost for taffy: $4.50
   - Total cost for seashells: $1.50
   - Total cost for magnets: $1.00
   - Total cost for all items: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - She spent $7.00.
   - Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left.

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- 80% of $1200 is 0.80 * $1200 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.

"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon will eat in 30 days.
   - Shannon eats 2 cookies a night.
   - Over 30 days, she will eat \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cookies.

2. Determine how many dozens of cookies are needed.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12.
   - \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozens.

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. 

First, we need to find out how many candles are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, this means that 1% of the candles are expected to explode. 

1% of 50,000 candles is:
\[ 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have this defect.

5% of 500 candles is:
\[ 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \text{ candles} \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

1. Calculate the discount per blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is 30% of $20.
   - \( 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price per blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost is the discounted price per blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
   - \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let \( c \) represent the number of camels and \( d \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as:
\[ c + d = 180 \]
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   \[
   200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   \[
   30\% \times 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Next 1 day**: He didn't travel at all.
   \[
   0 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   \[
   300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
   \]

Now, we sum all the distances:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.

Let's denote the size of Zack's locker as \( Z \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of Zack's locker, so we can write:

\[ \frac{1}{4}Z = 5 \]

To find \( Z \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ Z = 5 \times 4 \]
\[ Z = 20 \]

So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. We can write:

\[ Z = \frac{1}{2}T \]

Since we already know \( Z = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{2}T \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ T = 20 \times 2 \]
\[ T = 40 \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after a $4 savings, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after a $2 savings, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with. Let's break down the information:

1. Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over, so he must have made $150 in total from selling the cards.
2. Each card is sold for $1.5.
3. He keeps 1/3 of his cards, which means he sells 2/3 of his cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Since he sells 2/3 of his cards, the number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

The total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 150 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 150 \]
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 150 \]
\[ 1 \times x = 150 \]
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 1 hotdog for each of the remaining 18 guests.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 (needed) - 54 (prepared) = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26 / 2 = 13 guests.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater and then calculate how much earlier she should leave compared to Wayne.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

3. **Determine the time difference:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette should arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Bernadette should leave:**
   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).
   - Therefore, Bernadette should leave \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes before Wayne.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom. We are given the area of the room and the length in yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet, as the area is given in square feet and we need the perimeter in feet.

1 yard = 3 feet

So, the length of the room in feet is:
3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
Area = Length * Width

We can use this formula to find the width of the room:
360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and the width of the room, we can find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Substituting the values we have:
Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads

Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 beads (red) + 40 beads (clear) = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads

Total beads Margareth bought = 60 beads (blue) + 80 beads (red) = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is $20 for the movie and $1 extra for the popcorn and soda, making it $21 in total.

If you buy the regular movie ticket, it costs $12. The soda costs $3, and let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The total cost for the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda should be $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 21 - 2 \]
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 19 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

"To determine the cost of the potting soil for Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Step 1: Volume of one raised bed
The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height.
Volume of one bed = 2 feet (width) * 8 feet (length) * 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet

Step 2: Total volume of soil needed
Total volume = Volume of one bed * Number of beds
Total volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Step 3: Number of bags of potting soil required
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

Step 4: Total cost
Cost per bag = $12
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920

Therefore, the total cost for the potting soil will be $1920.

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:

- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

Next, we determine how many trips are needed to transport 4500 pounds of feed using a truck that can carry 2250 pounds at a time:

- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the shark's length and the remoras' lengths to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet and the remoras' lengths in inches, we will convert the shark's length to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.
2. Calculate the total length of the remoras.
3. Divide the total length of the remoras by the shark's length in inches to get the fraction of the shark's length that the remoras represent.
4. Convert this fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Shark's length in inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches
2. Total length of the remoras: 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches
3. Fraction of the shark's length: 12 inches / 120 inches = 0.1
4. Percentage: 0.1 * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day to break in his new shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason has to break in the shoes.
2. Divide the total minutes required by the number of days he can walk.

First, we know that Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes. Since he can walk 4 days a week, we calculate the total number of days he can walk in 3 weeks:

3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Next, we know that it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes. We divide this total by the number of days he can walk:

240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day to break in his new shoes.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

The total number of kids in the class is 32. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, and the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \) grains

Now, let's calculate this:

Weight of 2010 penny = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \) grains

Next, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to get the combined weight:

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 grains + 48 grains

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many songs Luri has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

Luri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 * 20
Luri's songs = 60

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. The media player can store up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
Songs Gabriel can add = 100 - Gabriel's current songs
Songs Gabriel can add = 100 - 20
Songs Gabriel can add = 80

For Luri:
Songs Luri can add = 100 - Luri's current songs
Songs Luri can add = 100 - 60
Songs Luri can add = 40

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

Fewer songs Luri can add = Songs Gabriel can add - Songs Luri can add
Fewer songs Luri can add = 80 - 40
Fewer songs Luri can add = 40

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can.

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(4 \text{ horses} \times 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The total consumption for 5 days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags required is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on the next level
- 2 cheerleaders on the next level
- 1 cheerleader at the top

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th is 60 inches tall, the shortest girl (60 inches) will be at the top.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders, each standing on the shoulders of the ones below them. Since the height of each level is the height of the cheerleader standing on that level, we can calculate the total height as follows:

- Bottom level (4 cheerleaders): 4 * 64 inches
- Second level (3 cheerleaders): 3 * 64 inches
- Third level (2 cheerleaders): 2 * 64 inches
- Top level (1 cheerleader): 1 * 60 inches

Now, let's add these up:

\[ 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 \]

\[ = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 \]

\[ = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12:

\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (Total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, we substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( L \):
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs needed = Total number of legs / 2 = 24 legs / 2 = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = Number of pairs * Cost per pair = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day for her bus trips is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20.00. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the trips:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ 2.00 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cows on the farm**: The farm has 30 cows.
2. **Cows on the zoo**: The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Therefore, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
3. **Sheep on the zoo**: The zoo has 20 sheep.
4. **Sheep on the farm**: The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Therefore, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo:

- **Total animals on the farm**: \(30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}\)
- **Total animals on the zoo**: \(60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}\)

Finally, the combined total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo is:

\[ 40 \text{ (farm)} + 80 \text{ (zoo)} = 120 \text{ animals} \]

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( P \).

According to the problem:
- \( 12 = 4O \) (since Rose bought 4 times the onions Sophia bought)
- \( 4 = 4P \) (since Rose bought 4 times the potatoes Sophia bought)

Solving these equations:
- \( O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \)
- \( P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \)

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal.
2. Calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Divide the total number of calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.**

- December 31st to January 1st: 1 day
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Adding these together: 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs.**

- 1 pound = 3500 calories
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.**

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

"To calculate Tara's profit, we need to determine her total cost and her total revenue, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) bags.
   - Each bag cost $4, so the total cost for the bags is \(40 \times 4 = \$160\).

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is \(40 \times 8 = \$320\).

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   - Therefore, the profit is \(320 - 160 = \$160\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially:

- Four $10 bills: \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars
- Six $20 bills: \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars

Total money Ali has: \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of $160: \(160 \div 2 = 80\) dollars

So, after giving his sister $80, Ali has:

- Remaining money: \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars

Then, Ali uses \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner:

- \( \frac{3}{5} \) of $80: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \) dollars

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

2. Each boy gets an equal share, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

Now, focusing on the eldest boy:

3. He adds $5 to his share, so he has $6 + $5 = $11.
4. The next day, he adds another $10, so he has $11 + $10 = $21.
5. He then spends $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13.
6. Finally, he triples the amount he has left, so he has $13 * 3 = $39.

The eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as in the first half.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves each day in the second half of the month is \( 2x \).

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Therefore, the amount he saves each day in the second half of the month is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and then subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:
- The cost of the apples is 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
- The cost of the oranges is 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
- The cost of the peaches is 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total cost = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $20 - $13.00
Change = $7.00

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we first calculate the total earnings for each of them based on the number of tasks they completed and the rate they are paid per task.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task. If he completes 20 tasks, his total earnings will be:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny earns $0.5 per task. If she completes 20 tasks, her total earnings will be:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day: Since Jeff's work is 3 miles away, he walks 3 miles to get there and 3 miles to get back. So, in one day, he walks a total of 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles.

2. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week: Since Jeff works 5 days a week, we multiply the distance he walks in one day by the number of days he works in a week. So, 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the steps Elise takes:

1. **First, she writes the full alphabet twice:**
   - The English alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice means: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Next, she writes half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Writing half once means: \(13\) letters.

3. **Then, she re-writes everything she has already written:**
   - She has already written \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything means: \(65\) letters.

4. **Total letters written:**
   - Adding up all the letters: \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the phone tree. Each person calls 3 new people, and this process repeats for each subsequent round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are called.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are called.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount, then apply the 10% discount to the total.

1. Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
2. Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
3. Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00
4. Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Now, we add up these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Total cost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"To find out how much change Carly gets back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered.

1. The cost of the hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4/hamburger = $20
2. The cost of the potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30/pack = $3
3. The cost of the fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2/can = $10

Now, we add up the costs to find the total amount spent:

Total cost = Cost of hamburgers + Cost of potato fries + Cost of fruit drinks
Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10
Total cost = $33

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost from $50 to find the change:

2. For the sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
   $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

3. To find the total commission, we add the two amounts together:
   $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 in commission.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with two holes each. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is:
7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons

These 14 buttons each have four holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is:
14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun moves relative to the ground, not just relative to the pyramid. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid, and it does so for 10 hours. This means the sun will have moved 50 degrees upward from the tip of the pyramid.

Since the pyramid itself is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add this angle to the angle the sun has moved upward to find the total angle from the ground to the sun.

Total angle from the ground to the sun = Angle of the pyramid + Angle the sun has moved upward
Total angle from the ground to the sun = 32 degrees + 50 degrees
Total angle from the ground to the sun = 82 degrees

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:

"To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the payments as follows:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half of what was given for each of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the amounts:

First tooth: $5.00
Next three teeth: $3.00
Last two teeth: $1.00

"To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday:
- There are 4 days from Sunday to Wednesday.
- Each wooden action figure costs $5.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is \( 4 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ dollars/day} = 20 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, we need to find out how much money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures:
- Peter starts with $70.
- He spends $20 on wooden action figures.
- Therefore, the remaining amount is \( 70 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, let's calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money:
- Each plastic action figure costs $2.
- The number of plastic action figures he can buy is \( \frac{50 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/figure}} = 25 \text{ figures} \).

Next, we calculate the number of wooden action figures he bought:
- He bought 1 wooden action figure each day for 4 days.
- Therefore, the total number of wooden action figures is \( 4 \text{ figures} \).

Finally, we sum the number of wooden and plastic action figures to get the total number of action figures:

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide by the number of days.

Total birds seen:
- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:

Average number of birds per day = Total birds / Number of days
Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7
Average number of birds per day = 40

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

468 - 450 = 18 degrees

The percentage increase is calculated as:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

This means the oven is running 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a desired temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x \) plus 4% of \( x \):

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]

\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve a temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes gives us:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost Pete if he buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

First, let's calculate the total cost for 2 boxes with the discount:
- The original price for 1 box is $100.00.
- The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is $100.00 * 10% = $10.00.
- The discounted price per box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.
- For 2 boxes, the total cost is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Next, let's determine the total number of contacts:
- Each box contains 90 contacts.
- For 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Finally, we calculate the cost per contact:
- The total cost is $180.00.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as follows:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per day.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week to get the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain twice as much protein:
\[ 3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

Step 3: To find the weekly protein intake, multiply the daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly production} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly production} = 120 \text{ pounds} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates they can make together in 12 hours. We do this by multiplying their hourly production by 12:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total production in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Marissa's total production in 12 hours} = 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total production of Ruiz and Marissa to get the combined total:

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, doubling the number of washes by using 1 pump per wash gives us:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per wash. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, so we divide the total cost by the number of washes to find the cost per wash:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since each wash now uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash, which is $0.10. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42 on the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants:
   - 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter.
   - Therefore, 4 dozen croissants require 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter.

2. Calculate the total amount of butter needed for a week (7 days):
   - If 4 dozen croissants require 1 pound of butter per day, then for 7 days, he will need 7 * 1 = 7 pounds of butter.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Funding: $100,000

2. **Subsequent months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for additional months: 50% more than the initial monthly funding
   - Initial monthly funding: $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month
   - Additional monthly funding: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month
   - Total funding for additional months: 45 months * $30,000 per month = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Initial 5 months: $100,000
   - Additional 45 months: $1,350,000
   - Total cost: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the amounts of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. So, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600 to get the speed in kb per hour:

\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \]

Next, we convert kb per hour to Mb per hour. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:

\[ 72000 \, \text{kb/h} \div 1000 = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and then the number of cars towed in the remaining four days of the week.

For the first three days:
- The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day.
- Therefore, for three days, the total number of cars towed is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) cars.

For the remaining four days:
- The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than 10 each day, which means it pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars each day.
- Therefore, for four days, the total number of cars towed is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cars.

Adding the totals from the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed for the week:
- Total cars towed = \(30 + 24 = 54\).

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the required height from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet, which is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches per year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches.

The difference in height Adam needs to grow is:
48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, the number of years it will take for him to grow 8 inches is:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.**
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**
The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Sales} - \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission.**
James gets a 10% commission on the profit.

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close a 75-mile gap, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Plugging in the values:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per attended class over $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. The cost per class if he attends all is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per attended class will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per attended class does not exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per attended class is then:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10.

   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) customers per day.

3. **Calculate the combined daily production:**
   - Combined daily production = Jewel's daily production + Julie's daily production
   - Combined daily production = 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

4. **Calculate the total weekly production:**
   - They work all 7 days of the week.
   - Total weekly production = Combined daily production \(\times\) 7

2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. So, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. If we let \( L \) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie's distance can be expressed as \( L + 3 \).

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Now, solve for \( L \):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he plans to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular hole can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds can be calculated as:

"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine how much flour was in one bag. Since one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag as follows:

1 portion = 2 kilograms
8 portions = 8 * 2 kilograms = 16 kilograms

So, one bag contains 16 kilograms of flour. Now, to find out how much flour was in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

3 bags * 16 kilograms/bag = 48 kilograms

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked:
Distance = Speed × Time
For Alisa, the speed is 12 miles per hour and the time is 4.5 hours.
Distance (Alisa) = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
For Stanley, the speed is 10 miles per hour and the time is 2.5 hours.
Distance (Stanley) = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to get the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance (Alisa) + Distance (Stanley)
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel cost: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost (hanger + fuel) = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

$330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the cooking time for pork is 30 minutes (for rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 minutes (for rice) + 50 minutes (for pork) = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
2. Determine the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
4. Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, which costs $5 per pound.
20% of $5 is \( 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \) dollar.
So, the more expensive brand costs \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) dollars per pound.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week.
Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so for a week (7 days), he needs \( 1 \times 7 = 7 \) pounds of coffee.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
The total cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) dollars.

Step 4: Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee.
The donut costs $2, so the total cost is \( 42 + 2 = 44 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

The distribution of the first 24 days is as follows:
- First 8 days: Good
- Next 8 days: Bad
- Next 8 days: Neutral

This accounts for the first 24 days. The remaining 6 days of the month are the last 6 days.

5. **Next Three Days**: The next three days are good, neutral, and good. This means:

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2S + 3 \]

We are also told that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To solve for \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we'll convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is:
600 inches (final height) - 240 inches (initial height) = 360 inches

Now, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find the number of days:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one for each dog, so he now has 12 (current) + 12 (new) = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he now has 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys, which is exactly the number of dogs he has.

Therefore, James needs a total of 21 toys.

"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first calculate the total weight of the group and then compare it to the maximum load capacity.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults (including Jack):
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

2. Compare the total weight to the maximum load capacity of the elevator:
   - Maximum load capacity = 700 kg.
   - Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load capacity = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To find out how many cookies they have in total, let's start by determining how many cookies each person has based on the information provided.

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies, we add the cookies each person has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5L \). Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the sum of the original length, the 50% extension, and the 20 cm lace trim:

\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris took to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, and then sum these times.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to mow the lawn by using both modes is the sum of the time taken in each mode.
   - Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R \), we can find \( T \):

\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Next, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This $1.20 is the total cost of four candies, so the cost of one candy is:
$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives the total cost:
$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $7.00.

$7.00"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves an additional 2/5 * 20 coins each month.

First, calculate the additional coins Neil saves:
\[ \text{Additional coins Neil saves} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person saves over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add Rong's and Neil's total savings to find the combined total:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits to get the total price of the crate:
\[ 5 \text{ (bananas)} + 6 \text{ (apples)} + 21 \text{ (oranges)} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

The price for such a crate of fruit is:

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter in square feet, we need to determine the number of squares of each color and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the number of squares is equal to the area in square feet.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - The comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18 blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24 green squares.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total area of the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get for the function, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs required and then compare it to the number of chairs the restaurant currently has.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 \text{ (adults)} + 15 \text{ (babies)} = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs and high chairs the restaurant has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The total number of chairs is the sum of the regular chairs and high chairs:
     \[
     40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs}
     \]

4. **Determine how many more chairs are needed:**
   - The number of additional chairs needed is the difference between the total number of chairs required and the total number of chairs the restaurant has:
     \[

"To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries compared to buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and then compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Fixed cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
   - Total pounds picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Total pounds)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Total pounds: 30

   Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Total pounds
   Total cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost of buying = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of this time, so we calculate the dog's time as follows:

\[ \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

Topher's shoe length in inches:
8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship, where \( B \) is the length of Bobby's shoe in inches:

\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

Now, we solve for \( B \):

\[ 9B = 100 - 10 \]

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- The total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.
- A quarter of the students' cars' windows is 256 windows * 1/4 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.
- Three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows is 64 windows * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars to the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:**
   - A 4-week month has 4 weeks, so two 4-week months have 8 weeks.
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - Therefore, in 8 weeks, there are:
     - Weekdays: \(8 \times 5 = 40\) weekdays
     - Weekends: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) weekend days

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays:**
   - Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
   - Total chairs rented on weekdays: \(40 \times 60 = 2400\) chairs

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekends:**
   - Candy rents 100 chairs each weekend day.
   - Total chairs rented on weekends: \(16 \times 100 = 1600\) chairs

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   - Total chairs rented: \(2400 + 1600 = 4000\) chairs

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with:
   \[
   48 \div 2 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

So, the final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is:

"To find out how much each roommate, including Jenna, will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill:
   - Monthly cost = $100
   - Annual cost = $100 * 12 months = $1200

2. Divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates (including Jenna) to find the individual share:
   - Number of roommates = 4 + 1 (Jenna) = 5
   - Individual share = $1200 / 5 = $240

So, each roommate, including Jenna, will pay $240 per year for electricity.

"To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of glasses and plates sent to the event.
2. Subtract the number of broken items from the initial count to find the remaining items.

First, let's convert the dozens to individual items:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we account for the broken items:
- 10 glasses were broken, so the remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- 6 plates were broken, so the remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates to get the total number of items Jeff has now:
- Total remaining items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading 90% of Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

3. **Trading 50% of Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

4. **Trading the Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers + 60 small buttons = 63 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from the first trade.
   - Lorraine has 63 small buttons from the second trade.
   - Total buttons = 9 large buttons + 63 small buttons.

Since the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert all large buttons to small buttons for a consistent count:
- 9 large buttons = 9 * 3 = 27 small buttons.
- Total small buttons = 27 + 63 = 90 small buttons.

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is equal to the total number of people on the council:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of shirts for each size.

1. **Extra-small (XS):** 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, the number of students needing size small is \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \).
3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of students needing size medium is \( 22 - 4 = 18 \).
4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of students needing size large is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, the number of students needing size extra-large is \( 9 + 6 = 15 \).

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = \( 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 \)

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can start by determining the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the following equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as P. We can set up the following equation:

2/3 * P = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

P = 18 * (3/2)
P = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. The third house needs double the first house, which is:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to and from work each day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of workdays in a week to get the weekly distance.
3. Determine the total amount of fuel used per week by dividing the weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency.
4. Calculate the weekly cost of fuel by multiplying the total amount of fuel used by the price per gallon.

Let's go through these steps:

1. One-way distance to work is 5 miles, so the round trip (to and from work) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
2. Andy works 5 days a week, so the weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.
3. Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon, so the total fuel used per week is 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons/week.
4. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the weekly cost of fuel is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week for his commute to work.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, which includes all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the total value of the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- The total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, let's calculate the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has ten twenties.
- The total value of the twenties is 10 * $20 = $200.

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties:
- 3/5 of $200 is (3/5) * $200 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties to find the total amount spent on lunch:
- Total amount spent = $35 (quarters) + $120 (twenties) = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
$155"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from both the tomato plants and the eggplant plants.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

Finally, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to get the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total number of TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) smart TVs.

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \) analog TVs.

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:
   - The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. The total number of TVs sold is 40, so the number of OLED TVs is \( 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \).

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total amount of money required for the trip after the school's contribution. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate the school's contribution as follows:

School's contribution = 1/2 * Total cost of the trip
School's contribution = 1/2 * $300
School's contribution = $150

Now, we need to find out how much John needs to contribute. This is the remaining half of the trip cost:

John's required contribution = Total cost of the trip - School's contribution
John's required contribution = $300 - $150
John's required contribution = $150

John currently has $50, so the amount of money he is missing is:

Money missing = John's required contribution - Money John has
Money missing = $150 - $50
Money missing = $100

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature during the night.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It is 33 degrees colder during the night, so the temperature at night is:
\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees. The required temperature increase is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of groups formed. Since 90 people are split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. So we calculate 3/5 of 10:

(3/5) * 10 = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. Since each group has 9 members, we calculate the total number of seashells brought back by one group:

9 members * 2 seashells/member = 18 seashells

Finally, we multiply the number of seashells brought back by one group by the number of groups that brought back seashells:

18 seashells/group * 6 groups = 108 seashells

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 108.

"To calculate Jamie's pay for the day she worked 11 hours, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Pay**: Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.
   - Regular pay = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

2. **Overtime Pay**: For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at 150% of her regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime hourly rate = 150% of $20 = 1.5 * $20 = $30/hour
   - Overtime pay = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. **Total Pay for the Day**: Sum of regular pay and overtime pay.
   - Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then determine the total salary cost for all employees over that period.

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of employees after three months:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary cost for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Since we need the total amount of money paid over three months, we multiply the monthly salary cost by 3:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly rates for both Billy and Sally and then determine the difference in their earnings for 20 hours of work.

1. **Billy's hourly rate progression:**
   - Initially, Billy was paid $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50, making his new rate $10.50 per hour.
   - On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00, making his new rate $11.50 per hour.

2. **Sally's hourly rate:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour, so Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour.

3. **Earnings for 20 hours:**
   - Billy's earnings for 20 hours at $11.50 per hour: \( 11.50 \times 20 = 230 \) dollars.
   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours at $10.50 per hour: \( 10.50 \times 20 = 210 \) dollars.

4. **Difference in earnings:**

"To find out how many trees will be planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class.
- Therefore, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Finally, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total collection. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we first calculate the total hours she has already played.

1. For the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   \[ 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

2. For the next week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week.
   \[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

3. Adding the hours from both periods:
   \[ 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

4. Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Subtract the hours she has already played from the total required:
   \[ 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate is 40%. Therefore, the fifth-graders' pass rate is 80%, which means 80 out of 100 fifth-graders passed. For 400 fifth-graders, the number who passed is \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)
- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.70 \times 100 = 70\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area that can be covered.

Step 1: Total number of glass chips
Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.
Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Step 2: Total area of mosaic that can be made
It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of mosaic.
Total area = Total chips / Chips per square inch = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Step 3: Length of the mosaic
The mosaic is 3 inches tall, so the length can be calculated by dividing the total area by the height.
Length = Total area / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower Rose picked, subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. For the first set of flowers:
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. For the second set of flowers:
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. For the third set of flowers:
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. For the fourth set of flowers:
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, we add up all the petals:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals in total before any flowers were dropped.

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one flower from each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total marshmallows in the bag**: 35
2. **Marshmallows used by John**: 9
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean**: 9
4. **Marshmallows dropped on the ground**: 3

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:
\[ 9 \text{ (John)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \]

Next, subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 marshmallows left in the bag.

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \).

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), we substitute \( s \) in the equation:

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

Finally, the amount of oil is:

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows he bought.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

The total amount of money John spent is the sum of the cost of the goats and the cows:
$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

So, John spent $4500 in total.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Calculate the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - Total cars no longer with Joe: \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Determine the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he has \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars left.

The final number of cars Joe remains with is:

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Since there are 20 students, and they each raised the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

Each student raised $6,250.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days to get the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the number of cycles, tasks per cycle, and the pay per task.

1. First, calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day:
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is \( 30 \times 5 = 150 \) tasks.

2. Next, calculate the daily earnings:
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the daily earnings are \( 150 \times 1.20 = 180 \) dollars.

3. Finally, calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are \( 180 \times 7 = 1260 \) dollars.

So, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we first need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food.

For cat food:
8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins

For dog food:
6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food to find the difference:
88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so:
   \( \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so:
   \( \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9 \)
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:
   \( \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
\( \text{Total eggs} = \text{Green eggs} + \text{Blue eggs} + \text{Pink eggs} + \text{Yellow eggs} \)
\( \text{Total eggs} = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 \)
\( \text{Total eggs} = 27 \)

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The shipping cost is based on the weight of the book and the distance to the distribution center.
   - The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles.

   Shipping cost = (Cost per pound * Weight) + (Cost per mile * Distance)
   Shipping cost = ($0.35 * 4) + ($0.08 * 20)
   Shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60
   Shipping cost = $3.00

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - The book cost $32.

   Refund amount = 75% of $32
   Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
   Refund amount = $24.00

3. **Calculate the total loss:**
   - The total loss is the original cost of the book minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost.
   - Original cost of the book = $32.00
   - Refund amount = $24.00
   - Shipping cost = $3.00

   Total loss = Original cost - Refund amount + Shipping cost
   Total loss = $32.00 - $24.00 + $3.00
   Total loss = $8.00 + $3.00
   Total loss = $11.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height that Naruto can lift a mountain, given the relative lifting capabilities of the characters and the base height that Pompei can lift a mountain.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given as 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Finally, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance \(D\) is the same for all animals. The speed of one kangaroo \(S_k\) can be calculated as:
   \[
   S_k = \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}}
   \]

2. Since the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle \(S_t\) is:
   \[
   S_t = \frac{1}{2} S_k = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). The combined speed of 4 turtles is:
   \[
   4 \times S_t = 4 \times \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{4D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}
   \]

4. The time \(T\) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \(D\) is:
   \[
   T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ P + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ P + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ P + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( P \):

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will give:
5 small apples * 3 pieces/small apple = 15 pieces

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together, we get the total number of slices:
15 pieces (from large apples) + 15 pieces (from small apples) = 30 pieces

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 pieces - 15 pieces = 15 pieces

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk currently produced by the 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
3 cows * 5 liters/cow/day = 15 liters/day

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The current production is 15 liters, so the additional amount needed is:
25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:
10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow/day = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires:
2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = 10 minutes per group

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:

- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. To convert this to a rate, we divide by the principal: \( r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \) or 75%.
- \( t = 3 \) years

Now, substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 300(1 + 0.75 \times 3) \]
\[ A = 300(1 + 2.25) \]
\[ A = 300 \times 3.25 \]
\[ A = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

975"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - White shirts with collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - White shirts with no collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Floral Shirts:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Floral shirts with no buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Difference:**
   - Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts with no collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to calculate the number of trays he can fill with 900 eggs and then multiply that by the price per tray.

1. Calculate the number of trays:
   Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
   Number of trays = 900 / 30
   Number of trays = 30

2. Calculate the total earnings:
   Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
   Total earnings = 30 * $2.5
   Total earnings = $75

The farmer will earn $75.

"To find out how many goats are left in both farms altogether, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sales and then add those numbers together.

Starting with Farm X:
- Initial number of goats: 55
- Number of goats sold: 10
- Number of goats left in Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45

Now, for Farm Y:
- Initial number of goats: 45
- Number of goats sold: 2 * 10 = 20 (twice as many as sold from Farm X)
- Number of goats left in Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25

Adding the remaining goats from both farms:
- Total number of goats left: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

He spends $2640 on shoes each year, so the average cost per pair of shoes is:
$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Baskets**: Each basket of green food costs $25. If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost for the green baskets is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75
   \]

2. **Cost of Red Baskets**: Each basket of red food costs $18. If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost for the red baskets before the discount is:
   \[
   3 \times 18 = 54
   \]

3. **Discount on Red Baskets**: You get $2 off for each basket of red food. Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Total Cost for Red Baskets After Discount**: Subtract the total discount from the total cost of the red baskets:
   \[
   54 - 6 = 48
   \]

5. **Total Cost for All Baskets**: Add the total cost of the green baskets and the total cost of the red baskets after the discount:
   \[
   75 + 48 = 123
   \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many rooms constitute one-half of the total rooms at the KozyInn Motel. 

Given that there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms would be:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it would take to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes to clean 45 rooms is:
\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes, and then double this amount, which is \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up the total number of homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built = \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\)

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \) (since I am three years younger than my brother)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \) (since I am two years older than my sister)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Simplify the equation step by step:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs. This will ensure that he has enough glue sticks for all the students and some extra.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Volume of Water**: The initial volume of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Volume After Heavy Rain**: After a day of heavy rain, the volume of water doubles. Therefore, the volume of water becomes:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Volume on the Third Day**: On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the volume of water on the third day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:

14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial ten people infected.

- **Day 0 (initial state):** 10 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people is now \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2:** Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people is now \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3:** Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people is now \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, after three days, the total number of people infected is 3430.

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate Rafaela's total tips as follows:

Rafaela's total tips = 40 customers * $20/customer = $800

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

10% of Rafaela's total tips = 10/100 * $800 = $80

Therefore, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela:

Julieta's total tips = Rafaela's total tips - $80 = $800 - $80 = $720

To find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

Total tips = Rafaela's total tips + Julieta's total tips = $800 + $720 = $1520

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In 1 year, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - We need to find how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber.
   - Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges.
   - The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices from all the loaves.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the slices.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
Since Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she would bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices from all the loaves.
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so for 10 loaves:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the slices.
Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so for 80 slices:

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.

Each of the 50 students was given 10 burritos, so the total number of burritos eaten by the students is:
50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so the total number of burritos eaten by Mr. George is:
20 burritos

The total number of burritos eaten by both the students and Mr. George is:
500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

The total number of burritos ordered was 600. To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered:
600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

"To find out how many yellow cars the bumper car rink has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of green cars:
   - The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   - Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is \( 12 - 2 = 10 \).

2. Determine the number of blue cars:
   - The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   - Since there are 10 green cars, the number of blue cars is \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \).

3. Calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
   - Red cars: 12
   - Green cars: 10
   - Blue cars: 30
   - Total of red, green, and blue cars: \( 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \).

4. Determine the number of yellow cars:
   - The rink has 75 cars in total.
   - The number of yellow cars is the total number of cars minus the number of red, green, and blue cars.

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for \( F \).

First, substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into \( S = A + 25 \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the total books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market for sale, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.**

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.**

Each chicken is sold for $50:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

**Step 3: Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.**

The profit formula is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} \]

Given that the profit is $2000:
\[ 2000 = 9000 - \text{Total cost} \]

Solving for the total cost:

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses and Julie sold 14, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we can calculate how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the length of the new rope she can buy with the money.
3. Calculate the cost of the new rope.
4. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money she has to find out how much she will have left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter.
Total money from selling the rope = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Step 2: Determine the length of the new rope she can buy.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of new rope she can buy, we divide the total money by the cost per meter.
Length of new rope = Total money / Cost per meter = $40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters (approximately)

Since Sarah can't buy a fraction of a meter, we'll assume she buys 26 meters of the new rope.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the new rope.
Cost of new rope = 26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Step 4: Calculate the leftover money.
Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of new rope = $40 - $39 = $1

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation to find her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now when this will happen as \( x \). We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Total cost for 6 packets of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

5. **Total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
   - Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

6. **Money left in budget:**
   - Kelly’s budget is $65.
   - Money left = Budget - Total cost
   - Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first account for the 15-minute encore in the final concert. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so the main part of the final concert, excluding the encore, is:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert's main part is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the main part of the final concert by 2:

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the original number of toys he had.

Argo originally had 200 toys. He gave away:
- 40 toys to Alyssa
- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

The total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Subtracting the total given away from the original amount:
200 - 150 = 50 toys.

Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the numbers together:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones are not able to find space on the stage. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones are left without space, so the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) petals.

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) petals.

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:
- \(40 - 25 = 15\)

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of indoor plants:
   One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, so:
   \( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \) indoor plants.

2. Calculate the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:
   \( 100 - 25 = 75 \) plants are either outdoor or flowering.

3. Calculate the number of outdoor plants:
   Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants, so:
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \) outdoor plants.

4. Calculate the number of flowering plants:
   The rest of the plants are flowering plants, so:
   \( 75 - 50 = 25 \) flowering plants.

5. Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:
   To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
   \( \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25\% \).

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
- A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.

First, we find the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we calculate the speed of a whirligig:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( C \).

The cost of the salad is $6.
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

Ellen eats two carrots, so the total cost for the carrots is \( 2C \).

The total cost for all the items she eats every day is the sum of the costs of the two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt, which is \( 2C + 6 + 3 \).

We know that the total cost is $11, so we can write the equation:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot is $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payments from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6.
   - Let the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn be \( J \).

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed other lawns:**
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total payment from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6 \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 3J \times 6 \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 5J \times 6 \) dollars.

4. **Sum the payments:**
   - Total payment from mowing lawns = \( 6 + (3J \times 6) + (5J \times 6) \).

5. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Total payment from mowing lawns = \( 6 + 18J + 30J \).
   - Total payment from mowing lawns = \( 6 + 48J \).

6. **Determine the total earnings:**
   - Tasha made $80 in total.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + (6 + 48J) = 80 \).

7. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L + 6 + 48J = 80 \).
   - \( L + 48J = 74 \).

8. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since Joe paid $6, and we need to find the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we need to find \( J \).
   - From the problem, we know \( J \) must be a whole number. Let's assume \( J = 1 \) (the simplest case).

9. **Substitute \( J = 1 \) into the equation:**
   - \( L + 48 \times 1 = 74 \).
   - \( L + 48 = 74 \).
   - \( L = 74 - 48 \).
   - \( L = 26 \).

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total capacity of the pot in terms of bowls:**
   - The pot can hold enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Convert the pot's capacity to a common unit:**
   - Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (because 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls), we can say that the pot holds 8 child bowls.

3. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for dinner:**
   - Calvin (1 adult bowl) + his wife (1 adult bowl) + 2 children (2 child bowls) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 bowls.
   - Converting the adult bowls to child bowls: 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls.
   - So, 2 adult bowls = 4 child bowls.
   - Total bowls needed for dinner = 4 child bowls (from adults) + 2 child bowls (from children) = 6 child bowls.

4. **Determine the leftover soup:**
   - The pot holds 8 child bowls.
   - 6 child bowls are used for dinner.
   - Leftover soup = 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

5. **Calculate how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch:**
   - There are 2 child bowls of leftover soup.
   - There are 2 children.
   - Each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
3. We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:

2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, at $7 each, is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14
- Total cost = $28

Since this total amount was the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, and they both received the same amount, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each received:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2
- Allowance per person = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of students playing each sport.

First, we calculate the number of students playing volleyball:
- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- There are twice that number playing volleyball, so \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) students playing volleyball.

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer:
- There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so \( 16 + 22 = 38 \) students playing soccer.

Now, we sum the students from all sports:
- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: 38 students

Total number of students = \( 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \).

"To determine the total profit the class was able to raise from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students.
\[
\text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

The class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find out how many pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so:
   \( \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \)
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:
   \( \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7 \)
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so:
   \( \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \)
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so:
   \( \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets:

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Calories per mini cinnamon roll:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Calories per mini cinnamon roll = \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.

2. **Total calories for 200 mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Total calories = 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

3. **Calories per mini blueberry muffin:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Calories per mini blueberry muffin = \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.

4. **Total calories for 300 mini blueberry muffins:**
   - Total calories = 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

Now, let's calculate the total and then find the average.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
- The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
- It travels for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
- The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
- It travels for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of toys Sophie already had and then subtract that total from the new total number of toys, which is 62.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Let's add these together:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48 toys.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before the bouncy balls from the new total:

62 (total toys now) - 48 (toys before bouncy balls) = 14 bouncy balls.

So, the tube contained 14 bouncy balls.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
2. At the start, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. So, 4 friends * 2 balloons each = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. So, at the start, the total number of balloons is 8 (friends) + 1 (Maria) = 9 balloons.
5. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, 5 * 3 = 15 more balloons.
6. Adding the additional balloons to the initial total: 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

   \]

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time taken to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).
   - Time taken to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. If Sam had 70 loaves of bread, then:

Bakery's loaves = 7 * Sam's loaves - 40

Substitute Sam's loaves with 70:

Bakery's loaves = 7 * 70 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 490 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 450

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum them up.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Price per copy: $5
   - Commission rate: 10%
   - Number of copies sold: 6

   Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50
   Total commission from New York Times = $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Price per copy: $15
   - Commission rate: 8%
   - Number of copies sold: 10

   Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20
   Total commission from Wall Street Journal = $1.20 * 10 = $12.00

3. **Total Commission:**
   Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
   Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, who is 26 years old. So, Marcus's age is:

26 - 5 = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Therefore, Leo’s age is twice Marcus's age:

21 * 2 = 42

Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we first need to determine how many pages are in one inch of the book. Since the book is printed on paper that is 100 pages to the inch, and the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

1.5 inches * 100 pages/inch = 150 pages

However, since each sheet of paper has a page printed on both sides, each sheet of paper actually contributes 2 pages to the total. Therefore, the number of sheets of paper is half the number of pages:

150 pages / 2 pages per sheet = 75 sheets

But the question asks for the number of pages, not sheets, so the total number of pages is:

150 pages

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

1. Calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

2. Determine Vince's stapling rate:
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   - Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   - Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier than usual.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than 6 a.m.
   - 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

4. **Total sleep time on her bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time spent sleepwalking: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.
   - Subtract the time she woke up earlier: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Kim slept on her bed that day is 452 minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

16 - 6 = 10

To find the total number of utensils remaining, we add the number of measuring cups to the number of measuring spoons left:

24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the occupancy after 2 weeks (14 days).
   - Total patients admitted in 14 days = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

4. **Total Occupied Beds After 14 Days**: 
   - Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 14 days
   - Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

5. **Unoccupied Beds**:
   - Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
   - Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Shawna and her father based on the information given about Aliya's age and the relationships between their ages.

1. We know that Aliya is 3 years old.
2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So, we have:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
   - Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the island had:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 40.
   - The total number of holes by the end of the third day is 29.
   - Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
2. Let \( S \) represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( W \) represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + S + W = 339 \) (Total Pokemon caught)
2. \( A = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4W - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, we substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4W - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.
2. She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies for the surprise party.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

First, let's convert all quantities to the same unit (individual brownies), knowing that 1 dozen equals 12 brownies.

- 1 dozen brownies = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen brownies = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen brownies = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies = 18 brownies

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies Greta had:

- Brownies made by Greta: 12
- Brownies from the office: 6
- Brownies from the surprise party: 48

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:

- Brownies eaten: 18

Remaining brownies = 66 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

- Let \( G_s \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_s \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_u \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_u \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
   \[
   G_s = 10
   \]
2. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
   \[
   A_s = A_u - 4
   \]
3. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday.
   \[
   G_u = G_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15

"To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to add up the beads she received from her mother, her sister, and her friend.

1. Beads from her mother: 20 beads
2. Beads from her sister: Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
3. Beads from her friend: Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we add them all together:

20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

"To determine the total number of servings Joe has, we first need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days.

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 + 12 + 6 = 21\] pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds of crawfish by the number of pounds per serving to find the total number of servings:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7\] servings.

"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members, and then add these numbers together.

First, we calculate the number of football players:
20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we find out how many students are left after the football players leave:
30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Then, we calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members from the remaining students:
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:
6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots.

Given that Sophie wears size 5 boots and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

Charlie's boot size = 5 * Sophie's boot size
Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5
Charlie's boot size = 25

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's boot size + Charlie's boot size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet**: Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space required for each plant including the space between them**: Each plant requires 1 foot of space for the plant itself and 1.5 feet of space between plants, totaling 2.5 feet per plant.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed**: 
   \[
   \text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Length of the flower bed}}{\text{Space required per plant}} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy**:
   \[
   \text{Additional plants needed} = 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for the additional plants**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

For one basket:
- The cost of 3 petunias is 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- The cost of 2 sweet potato vines is 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

The total cost for one basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Since Katherine has 5 baskets to fill, the total cost will be 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

$70.00"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (for sunflowers) + 15 pounds (for carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total gives us the remaining soil:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To determine how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly savings for shoes.
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Step 2: Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Jessica sets aside $6,000.00 in a year for shoes.

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so:
\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet returns every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the checks for each category and then sum them up.

1. **Electric Bill**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

2. **Gas Bill**: 1 check per month
   - 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year

3. **Church**: 2 checks per month
   - 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: 1 check per quarter
   - 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric Bill: 12 checks/year
- Gas Bill: 12 checks/year
- Church: 24 checks/year
- Pest and Lawn Service: 4 checks/year

Total checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's trips:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining one-quarter of its flights are split equally between France and Germany.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - Three-quarters of 88 trips: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips to Greece.

4. **Calculate the number of remaining trips:**
   - The remaining trips are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.

5. **Determine the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany.
   - Therefore, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11.

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of all three howls:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is the sum of their ages:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so the total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all slices:
\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is \( 8x \). Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank each day and then determine how much more is needed to fill the tank.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
     \[ \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons} \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
     \[ \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons} \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[ \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[ \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons} \]

3. **Total Water Pumped:**
   - Total water pumped by Wanda over two days:
     \[ \text{Wanda's total} = 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \text{ gallons} \]
   - Total water pumped by Ms. B over two days:
     \[ \text{Ms. B's total} = 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \text{ gallons} \]
   - Total water pumped into the tank:
     \[ \text{Total water} = 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

4. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Water remaining to be filled:
     \[ \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 3 \times 0.07x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28\% \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28\%}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 5 \times 0.09y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44\% \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44\%}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

Next, we calculate Janet's total earnings per hour, which is the sum of her wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

Now, we calculate her total earnings per week, given that she works 40 hours a week:

\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:

Total cost = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of packs Anne gave away: Since she kept 2 packs and there were originally 15 packs, she gave away \(15 - 2 = 13\) packs.
2. Determine the total number of pieces in the packs she gave away: Each pack contains 60 pieces, so 13 packs contain \(13 \times 60 = 780\) pieces.
3. Divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received: \(780 \div 10 = 78\).

Each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums with the same number of pictures in each, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 of the albums were selfies and 2 of the albums were portraits. To find out how many selfies and portraits there were, we multiply the number of albums for each category by the number of pictures per album:

Selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures
Portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the two amounts together:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

So, Olivia had a total of 45 pictures that were either selfies or portraits.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we can set up a proportion based on the information given. If James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages.

First, we find the rate at which James reads:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we use this rate to find the time it takes to read 18 pages:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ pages/10 minutes}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 120 = 12x + 4(2x) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the daily consumption for each family member and then multiply by 7 days.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in one week he eats:
5 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 35 sandwiches/week

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in one week she eats:
4 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 28 sandwiches/week

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in one week he eats:
2 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 14 sandwiches/week

Now, we add up the weekly consumption for all family members:
35 sandwiches/week (man) + 28 sandwiches/week (wife) + 14 sandwiches/week (son) = 77 sandwiches/week

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes, and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, calculate the earnings from the cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

Next, calculate the earnings from the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Now, add the earnings from both the cookies and cupcakes to get the total earnings:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
2 sisters * $10/sister = $20

Finally, subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings to find out how much money Suzanne has left:
$320 - $20 = $300

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.

1. A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes:
\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Next, we find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days:
\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the information that the prices are proportional. This means the cost per sandwich is the same across all package sizes.

First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

- For the first package: 2 sandwiches for $3, the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
- For the second package: 4 sandwiches for $6, the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this cost to find the price of the third package:

- For the third package: 8 sandwiches, the cost would be 8 sandwiches * $1.50/sandwich = $12.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he does not have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two further scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he does not have to turn in his homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
       - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
       - So, the probability that he does not have to turn in his homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
   - Total probability = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Having to Turn in Homework:**
   - The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is the complement of the total probability of not turning it in:
     - 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 or 24%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

"To determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
2. Seats for graduates: 950
3. Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats for friends and family = Total seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - 1250
Total seats for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the total seats for friends and family by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Total seats for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in school. Then, we'll determine how long it will take for him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost while in school:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Determine Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

So, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider on each side. This means the fabric dimensions will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Each piece of fabric will therefore be 8 feet by 10 feet. The area of one piece of fabric is:

Area = Length × Width
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:

Total Area = 2 × Area of one piece
Total Area = 2 × 80 square feet
Total Area = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.
2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Letters delivered on Tuesday: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Letters delivered on Wednesday: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

Now, we sum the letters delivered over the three days:
- Monday: 425

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, he won $11 on the second race.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 on the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 on the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race loss: $5
- Second race gain: $11 (this reduces the total loss)
- Third race loss: $16.50

Total loss = First race loss - Second race gain + Third race loss
Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.50
Total loss = $5 + $16.50 - $11
Total loss = $21.50 - $11
Total loss = $10.50

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
Average loss = $10.50 / 3
Average loss = $3.50

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.50 that day.

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit, and then calculate their new heights.

Xavier's initial height is 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height is 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
1 inch"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times (x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]

\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The formula for depreciation at a constant rate is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $20,000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% or 0.21
- Number of Years = 2010 - 2007 = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.78.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food available by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, calculate the total daily consumption:
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Now, determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices, which is 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - There were 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices.

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each took, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of each service provided:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the 30-minute visit: Since the doctor charges $300 per hour, for 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: 30 pills at $4 each is 30 * $4 = $120
4. The cost of parking: 2 hours at $6 per hour is 2 * $6 = $12

Now, we add all these costs together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys.
3. Subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, we find the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day.
- The second monkey eats 14 bananas per day.
- Together, they eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315, we can find the total daily consumption of all three monkeys:
- Total daily consumption = \(315 \div 7 = 45\) bananas per day.

Finally, we subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey:
- Daily consumption of the third monkey = \(45 - 24 = 21\) bananas per day.

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs.

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Total saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

2. Determine how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200:
   - Total needed = 200 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks already saved = 120 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks still needed = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining toothpicks:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - Toothpicks still needed = 80 toothpicks.
   - Weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during the month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.
3. **BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.
4. **MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars.
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars (since BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, \( 500 / 2 = 250 \) dollars).
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total time he spends in class during the week and the additional time he spends on weekends.

1. **Calculate the total class time during the week:**
   - John has 6 periods a day, plus 2 extra classes, making it 8 periods a day.
   - Each period is 40 minutes long.
   - He goes to class for 5 days a week.

   Total class time per day = 8 periods/day * 40 minutes/period = 320 minutes/day
   Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

2. **Calculate the extra learning time on weekends:**
   - John spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on each of Saturday and Sunday.

   Extra learning time per day on weekends = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/day
   Total extra learning time on weekends = 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes

3. **Calculate the total learning time per week:**
   - Total learning time = Total class time per week + Total extra learning time on weekends

   Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes

4. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**

"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Determine the height of the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height of the second bounce.

**Step 1: Initial Height**
The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Height of the First Bounce**
The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. So, the height of the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 3: Height of the Second Bounce**
The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height of the first bounce. So, the height of the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the ball on its second bounce is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means that the 270 kilograms of meat the Allosaurus ate was the other half. Therefore, before the velociraptors ate, there must have been 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex ate was the other half. Therefore, before the T-Rex ate, there must have been 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high. Therefore, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high. Therefore, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, the cost to purchase the paint is calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is:

2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps based on his working days and the rate at which he helps people.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of working days = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of working days * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance that Amber ran, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, you need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

There are three women wearing 4-inch heels and three women wearing 2-inch heels. 

First, calculate the total height of the heels:
- Total height of 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
- Total height of 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches

Now, add these totals together to get the overall total height:
- Total height of all heels: \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches

Next, divide the total height by the number of women to find the average height:
- Number of women: \(3 + 3 = 6\)
- Average height of heels: \(18 \div 6 = 3\) inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and then figure out how many miles she plans to hike each day.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will hike:

\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:

\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and the miles she will hike at her current rate is:

\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:

\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the increase in enrollment and then add that to last year's enrollment number.

Last year's enrollment: 50 students
Increase in enrollment: 20% of 50 students

To find 20% of 50, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Increase} = \text{Last year's enrollment} \times \frac{\text{Percentage increase}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Increase} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

Now, we add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment:
\[ \text{This year's enrollment} = \text{Last year's enrollment} + \text{Increase} \]
\[ \text{This year's enrollment} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse blinks. We know that it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can find the rate of blinking per minute by dividing the total number of blinks by the total time in minutes:

\[ \text{Rate of blinking} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks we want by the rate of blinking:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fish in Tate's garden pond before and after the purchase.

Initially, the pond has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfish
- 5 female goldfish

After Tate buys more fish, the pond will have:
- 4 (initial) + 2 (bought) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial) + 1 (bought) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial) + 2 (bought) = 5 male goldfish
- 5 (initial) + 3 (bought) = 8 female goldfish

Now, we sum up the total number of male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

To find out how many more female fish there are than male fish:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John drives in a month for his visits to his parents.

1. First, we calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house:
   - Speed = 70 mph
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. Since this is a round trip, the total distance for one visit is:
   - Round trip distance = 140 miles (one way) × 2 = 280 miles

3. John visits his parents twice a month, so the total monthly distance is:
   - Monthly distance = 280 miles/visit × 2 visits/month = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

   - Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
   - In 7 days, she will walk \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Relate Sofie's distance to Brian's distance:**
   - In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
   - Let \( B \) be the distance Brian walks in 7 days.
   - According to the problem, \( 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times B \).

3. **Solve for \( B \):**

"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Total toys needed**: 400 toys.
2. **Toys still needed after the shift**: 20 toys.
3. **Toys produced during the shift**: 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- **Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each**:
  - Total production by these two workers in 10 hours: \(2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- **Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each**:
  - Total production by these two workers in 10 hours: \(2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

Adding the production of these four workers:
- Total production by the four workers: \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
- Total toys produced by the fifth worker: \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the production rate of the fifth worker is:
- Toys per hour by the fifth worker: \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: They painted the same number of eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs each of them painted as \( A \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: They painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Camden painted as \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( C + S = 30 \)
- \( C = S + 12 \)

We can substitute \( C \) in the first equation with \( S + 12 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. Since the total number of eggs is 56 and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs:
\[ A + A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. Since each group goes into one box, there will be 25 boxes.

3. Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. Then, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, knowing that there are 16 ounces in a pound:
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{\frac{40}{60} \text{ hours}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Convert this time into minutes:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has. The equation based on the information given is:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of the marbles he has. We subtract 10 from the current number of marbles:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. Initial number of cows: 50
2. Initial number of chickens: 20

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day for three weeks (21 days):
- Increase in cows: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day for three weeks (21 days):
- Increase in chickens: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add the increases to the initial numbers:
- Total cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
- Total chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:
- Total animals: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

   - Total cost without discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

3. Calculate the total cost with the discount:
   - Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
   - Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

4. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   - Each pack has 9 bagels.
   - Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

5. Calculate the cost per bagel:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed for a certain number of scoops:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
   \]
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
   \]
   So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   We need to find out how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   \[
   \frac{18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops/set}} = 9 \text{ sets}
   \]
   Since each set requires 3 potatoes:
   \[
   9 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ potatoes/set} = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester needs:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans.

- There are 17 green jellybeans.
- There are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, so there are \(17 \times 2 = 34\) red jellybeans.

Next, we add the number of green and red jellybeans to find the total number of non-blue jellybeans:
- \(17 + 34 = 51\) non-blue jellybeans.

Since the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of non-blue jellybeans from the total:
- \(60 - 51 = 9\) blue jellybeans.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**

   Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand (100% / 20% = 5 bottles).

   Therefore, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
   \[
   2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine the current production capacity:**

   Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**

   The additional number of bottles required is the difference between the total number of bottles needed and the current production capacity:
   \[
   11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two, so we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400 to get the number of apartments in the third complex.

60% of 400 = 0.60 * 400 = 240
Number of apartments in the third complex = 400 + 240 = 640

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
Total number of apartments = 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040

Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections is:
Total collections per week = 1040 apartments * 3 collections/week = 3120 collections/week

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.
John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
Total money per week = 3120 collections/week * $0.40/collection = $1248

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:

Next, we know that after giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount.

3. Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
4. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.

- On Wednesday, she counts double the number from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- On Thursday, she counts double the number from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- On Friday, she counts double the number from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of puffs counted each day:

\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod for the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods that can be bought for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with $1:**
   - Since 1 pod is used per cycle, the number of cycles that can be run with 10 pods is 10 cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   - Number of $20 bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

2. **Losing Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills.
   - Remaining bills = 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. **Paying a Bill**: Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Bills used to pay the bill = 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
   - Remaining bills = 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. **Tripling the Money**: Thomas triples the remaining money.
   - Value of remaining bills = 20 bills * $20 = $400.
   - Tripled value = $400 * 3 = $1200.

5. **Converting to $5 Bills**: Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills.
   - Number of $5 bills = $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.

So, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) goals.

3. Total goals scored by each team:
   - Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals.
   - Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals.

4. Total number of goals scored in the match:
   - \(6 + 10 = 16\).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the length of the chalk after each day and determine how many days it will take for the chalk to become smaller than 2 inches.

1. **Initial Length of Chalk on Monday**: 5 inches
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches
3. **Remaining Chalk on Monday**: 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Starting from Tuesday, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

4. **Chalk Used on Tuesday**: 20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches
5. **Remaining Chalk on Tuesday**: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches

6. **Chalk Used on Wednesday**: 20% of 2.20 inches = 0.20 * 2.20 = 0.44 inches
7. **Remaining Chalk on Wednesday**: 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches

At the end of Wednesday, the remaining length of the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk at the end of Wednesday.

The teacher has to recycle the chalk after 2 more days (Tuesday and Wednesday).

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students who are on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
1/3 * 12 girls = 4 girls on varsity

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
1/4 * 12 boys = 3 boys on varsity

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity

The total number of students in the class is:
12 girls + 12 boys = 24 students

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. This means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

James has 30 teeth in total. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her friends and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Total cheese slices consumed = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Total pepperoni slices consumed = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together:
- Total number of pizzas needed = 3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour, which is 5 snowballs every 15 minutes (since 20 snowballs / 4 intervals = 5 snowballs per 15 minutes).

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, the net increase in snowballs every 15 minutes is:
5 (made) - 2 (melted) = 3 snowballs.

To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net increase per 15-minute interval:
60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:
20 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 300 minutes.

Converting 300 minutes into hours:
300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \( x - 38 \) bandages left.
   - After ordering one bulk pack, they had \( x - 38 + 50 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \( ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 \) bandages left.

4. **Final Condition:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 = 78
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   (x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25) = 78
   \]
   \[
   (x + 50 - 38 - 28 + 100 - 25) = 78
   \]
   \[
   (x + 59) = 78
   \]
   \[
   x = 78 - 59

3. The height of the first floor (from the ground to the first floor ceiling) is 3 times Mattison's height, which is \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) inches.

The height from the second floor's floor to the roof is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 240 inches.

"To determine how many shells team Gogetters found, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Determine the remaining shells after team Alphas have found their share.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The Finders from the remaining shells.
4. Subtract the number of shells found by team The Finders from the remaining shells to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells.
   \[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

2. The remaining shells after team Alphas have found their share:
   \[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

3. Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
   \[ \text{Shells found by The Finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

4. The number of shells found by team Gogetters is the remaining shells after both team Alphas and team The Finders have found their shares:
   \[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Thus, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance walked by the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. This means the total distance walked by all 4 dogs together is:

\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We know the distances walked by the first three dogs are 1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles. Adding these together gives:

\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance walked by the last dog, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:

\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price (CP) of the magazines is $72.

The selling price (SP) is 11/8 of the cost price, so we calculate it as follows:
\[ SP = \frac{11}{8} \times CP \]
\[ SP = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]
\[ SP = 11 \times 9 \]
\[ SP = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = SP - CP \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 2 \text{ liters/day} \).
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 4 \text{ liters/day} \).
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is:

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of the classes in each school.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes each have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

120 students / 8 = 15 students

John has two classes, so the total capacity for John's school is:

15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school to the capacity of John's school to get the combined capacity:

120 students (Ali's school) + 30 students (John's school) = 150 students

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many of those diaper changes Jordan's wife handles.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles from the total to find out how many Jordan changes.

Step 1: Total number of diaper changes per day
- Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
- Jordan has 2 children.
- Total diaper changes per day = 5 changes/child/day * 2 children = 10 changes/day.

Step 2: Number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles
- Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
- Number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles = 10 changes/day * 1/2 = 5 changes/day.

Step 3: Number of diaper changes Jordan handles
- Total diaper changes per day - Number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles = 10 changes/day - 5 changes/day = 5 changes/day.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans based on the effective volume and the volume of a single jelly bean.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on the percentage of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans.**

The volume of one jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - The new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**
   - Total cost = Cost before the price increase + Cost after the price increase
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all her visits to the museum.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can set up the relationships described in the problem with the information given.

Let's denote:
- The number of paintings Kim has as \( K \),
- The number of paintings Shelley has as \( S \),
- The number of paintings Samantha has as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so \( M = S - 12 \).
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so \( S = K + 8 \).
3. Samantha has 27 paintings, so \( M = 27 \).

Using the first equation and the value of \( M \), we can find \( S \):
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

Now, using the value of \( S \) in the second equation, we can find \( K \):
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, we have the distance Michael has traveled (3600 km) and the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km). To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. This means he used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, the mother used \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.

Now, let's add up all the grapes used:

- Grapes eaten by Madeline: 6
- Grapes used by her brother: 30
- Grapes used by their mother: 48

Total grapes used = \(6 + 30 + 48 = 84\)

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all classrooms.
2. Determine the total available working time in minutes over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Convert the average time spent cleaning per day into a percentage of the total working day.

**Step 1: Total time required to clean all classrooms**
- There are 80 classrooms.
- It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom.
- Total time required = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

**Step 2: Total available working time in minutes over 5 days**
- The custodian works 8 hours per day.
- 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.
- Over 5 days, the total available working time = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes.

**Step 3: Average time spent cleaning per day**
- Total time required to clean all classrooms = 1200 minutes.
- Number of days = 5.
- Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day.

**Step 4: Convert the average time spent cleaning per day into a percentage of the total working day**

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total after the first test.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- First test: 70 questions
- Second test: 40 questions
- Total questions: 70 + 40 = 110 questions

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to get right to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to pass: 77
- Questions already correct: 42
- Questions needed on the second test: 77 - 42 = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There is a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people.
   - There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 2 * 8 (for rooms)
   - Total flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 4 small candles for half the rooms.
   - There are 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms.
   - Half of the 8 rooms is 4 rooms.
   - Total small candles = 4 small candles/room * 4 rooms = 16 small candles
   - Total medium candles = 5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms = 20 medium candles
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36 = 56

So, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract Butler High School's enrollment from Norman High School's enrollment:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the 4 tables and then subtract that from the 40 screws he has.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg needs 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table requires \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
4. For 4 tables, the total number of screws required is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

James has 40 screws initially. After using 32 screws for the tables, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we first need to determine how much each individual raised.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron. Therefore, Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did.
   - Aaron's distance = 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - If Aaron's speed is 1/8 miles per minute, then Vanessa's speed is half of that.
   - Vanessa's speed = (1/8) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

4. **Determine the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how much new line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, the total required line is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line/foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes a week from reservations, we need to calculate the total revenue from a single reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations per night and the number of days the restaurant is open per week.

First, let's calculate the revenue from a single reservation:
- Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for meals is 2 * $5 = $10.
- Each reservation also orders a $5 bottle of wine.
- Therefore, the total revenue from one reservation is $10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15.

Next, we calculate the total revenue per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, so the revenue per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Finally, we calculate the weekly revenue:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the weekly revenue is 2 * $90 = $180.

Therefore, the restaurant makes $180 a week from reservations.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost price (CP) of the watermelons:
   CP = $80

2. Calculate the total profit:
   Profit = 25% of CP
   Profit = 0.25 * $80
   Profit = $20

3. Calculate the total selling price (SP) of all the watermelons:
   SP = CP + Profit
   SP = $80 + $20
   SP = $100

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   SP per watermelon = SP / Number of watermelons
   SP per watermelon = $100 / 50
   SP per watermelon = $2

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19 years old. Since James is 18 years old now, John's current age is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

1. The original cost of the radiator is $400.
2. The discount is 80%, so the cost of the radiator after the discount is 20% of $400.
3. The cost of the radiator after the discount is $400 * 0.20 = $80.
4. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator, so the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.
5. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

Therefore, Mark paid $230 in total.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is Henry and his 3 friends, making a total of 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each of them can have 14 slices.
