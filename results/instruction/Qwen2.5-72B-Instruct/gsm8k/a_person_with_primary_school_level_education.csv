"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs each day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. That means she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself. 

So, the number of eggs left to sell is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. 

Since she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find out how many bolts in total it takes to make a robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It takes half that much white fiber, which means it takes 2 divided by 2, which is 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together:
2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts in total.

"First, let's figure out the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value by 150%.

150% of $80,000 is:
150/100 * 80,000 = 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000

So, the value increased by $120,000. The new value of the house is:
80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000

Now, let's find out how much Josh spent in total:
80,000 (purchase price) + 50,000 (repairs) = 130,000

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

"To find out how many meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each time by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by how many times he does this in a week.

He runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So for each session, he runs:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

He does this 3 times a week, so in a week he runs:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens each day.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily amount.

First, we know each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day. Wendi has 20 chickens, so:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we add the feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed:
\[ 60 \text{ cups/day} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we can break it down like this:

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.
3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

So, for every two glasses, Kylar pays $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying:
16 รท 2 = 8 pairs

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
8 pairs ร $8 per pair = $64

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we multiply the number of sheep in Seattle by 4:
20 sheep * 4 = 80 sheep in Charleston.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2:
80 sheep * 2 = 160 sheep in Toulouse.

Now, we add up all the sheep:
20 sheep (Seattle) + 80 sheep (Charleston) + 160 sheep (Toulouse) = 260 sheep.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.

2. Next, we calculate how long it takes to download 80 GB.
   - Carla downloads at a speed of 2 GB/minute, so it takes \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \) minutes.

3. After the download is 40% complete, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.

4. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, she needs to download the full 200 GB again.
   - It takes \( 200 \div 2 = 100 \) minutes to download 200 GB.

5. Now, we add up all the time:
   - Time to download 80 GB: 40 minutes
   - Time for the restart: 20 minutes
   - Time to download 200 GB again: 100 minutes

   Total time = 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes

"First, let's figure out how far John drove initially.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Now, let's see how far he gets back home in the 4 hours.

1. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move at all.
2. For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

So, after 2.5 hours, he has driven 15 miles back home.

3. For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, in the last 1.5 hours, he drives 120 miles back home.

Adding the distances he drove back home:
\[ 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles} \]

Now, subtract the distance he drove back home from the initial distance:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and then for the 5 hours of overtime.

1. **Regular Pay for 40 hours:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - For 40 hours, her pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay for 5 hours:**
   - Overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.
   - For 5 hours of overtime, her pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

"First, let's figure out how many downloads there were in the second month. The second month had three times as many downloads as the first month. Since the first month had 60 downloads, the second month had:

60 downloads * 3 = 180 downloads

Next, we need to find out how many downloads there were in the third month. The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we do:

180 downloads * 30% = 180 downloads * 0.30 = 54 downloads

So, the downloads in the third month were reduced by 54. To find the total downloads in the third month, we subtract 54 from 180:

180 downloads - 54 downloads = 126 downloads

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month together:

60 downloads (first month) + 180 downloads (second month) + 126 downloads (third month) = 366 downloads

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them all together.

1. For the donuts:
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, the cost for the donuts is 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. For the mini cupcakes:
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. For the mini cheesecakes:
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add the costs of all the pastries together:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

So, the total cost is $694.

"To figure out when Carlos starts earning money from his lemon tree, we need to look at how much he spends and how much he earns each year.

First, let's see how much he earns from selling lemons each year:
- Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- So, each year he earns 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5.

Next, let's see how much he spends each year:
- It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.
- So, each year he spends $3.

Now, let's find out his net earnings each year:
- Each year, he earns $10.5 and spends $3.
- So, his net earnings each year are $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, we need to see how many years it will take for his net earnings to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
- Each year, he earns $7.5.
- To find out how many years it takes to earn $90, we divide $90 by $7.5.

$90 รท $7.5 = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling some at the orange house.
2. Before the orange house, she had twice as many because she sold half of what was left there. So, before the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house than she did at the green house. If we let the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house be \( x \), then she sold \( x + 2 \) at the red house.
4. The total number of vacuum cleaners before the red house is the sum of what she had before the orange house and what she sold at the red house: \( 10 + (x + 2) \).
5. The total number of vacuum cleaners before the green house is the sum of what she had before the red house and what she sold at the green house: \( 10 + (x + 2) + x \).
6. We know that the total number of vacuum cleaners before the green house is the total she started with, and this is equal to \( 10 + 2x + 2 \).

Since she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = \frac{1}{3} (10 + 2x + 2) \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1}{3} (12 + 2x) \]
\[ 3x = 12 + 2x \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, she sold 12 vacuum cleaners at the green house. Now, we can find the total number she started with:
\[ 10 + 2x + 2 = 10 + 2(12) + 2 = 10 + 24 + 2 = 36 \]

So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

20% of 20 = 0.20 ร 20 = 4 students

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left.

Next, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

25% of 16 = 0.25 ร 16 = 4 students

So, the number of students left for hip-hop dance is:

16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance:

(12 / 20) ร 100 = 60%

"To find out which option gives more profit, we need to calculate the profit from each option.

For the jewelry:
- The jewelry is worth $5,000.
- The market is expected to go up by 2.5%.
- The profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets:
- The gadgets are worth $8,000.
- The market is expected to go up by 1.2%.
- The profit from gadgets = $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96.

Comparing the two profits:
- Jewelry profit = $125
- Gadgets profit = $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

The maximum profit the merchant can make is $125.

"To find out Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate how much she earns from teaching and coaching separately, and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours each week.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- So, each week she earns 35 hours * $20/hour = $700.
- Since she works 50 weeks a year, her yearly earnings from teaching are 50 weeks * $700/week = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She coaches for 15 hours each week.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- So, each week she earns 15 hours * $30/hour = $450.
- Since she works 50 weeks a year, her yearly earnings from coaching are 50 weeks * $450/week = $22,500.

Now, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
- Total annual salary = $35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Eggs per day**: Claire makes a 3 egg omelet each morning.
2. **Days in a week**: There are 7 days in a week.
3. **Eggs per week**: 
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]
4. **Weeks in 4 weeks**: There are 4 weeks.
5. **Eggs in 4 weeks**:
   \[
   21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}

6. **Eggs per dozen**: There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
7. **Dozens of eggs in 4 weeks**:
   \[
   \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens}
   \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to figure out how much time she has left to complete the trail and how much distance is left.

1. Marissa has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.
2. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, so she has 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles left to walk.
3. Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12 miles. To find out the total time she needs to complete the trail at this average speed, we use the formula: 
   \[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
   \[ \text{Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
4. Marissa has already spent 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours walking.
5. To achieve her goal, she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.
6. To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula:
   \[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
   \[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"First, let's figure out how much water is in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- It's 10 liters, but 1 liter is spilled, so we have 9 liters left.
- Two-thirds of it is water, so \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters of water.

For the pineapple drink:
- It's 15 liters.
- Three-fifths of it is water, so \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters of water.

Now, we add the water from both drinks:
- Water from orange drink: 6 liters
- Water from pineapple drink: 9 liters
- Total water: 6 + 9 = 15 liters

So, the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink is 15 liters.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to figure out how many hours the candle burns and then multiply that by how much it melts each hour.

The candle starts burning at 1:00 PM and stops at 5:00 PM. That's 4 hours of burning time.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by 2 centimeters:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid, $19.50, is 75% of the original price because he got a 25% discount. 

Let's call the original price of the book \( P \).

Since $19.50 is 75% of \( P \), we can write this as:
\[ 19.50 = 0.75 \times P \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]

   - Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.
   - Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"First, let's figure out how fast Dana can run and walk.

If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and skipping is half as fast as running, then running is twice as fast as skipping. So, Dana can run at:
3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since running is four times faster than walking, walking is:
6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's see how much time she spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running:
6 hours * 1/3 = 2 hours.

Time spent walking:
6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours.

Now we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking.

Distance running:
2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles.

Distance walking:
4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles.

Total distance traveled:
12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her usual 400 feet. So, we need to calculate three times 400 feet:

3 * 400 = 1200 feet

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:

1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"First, we need to find out how many pieces of pie there were in total. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, we multiply 5 by 8 to get the total number of pieces.

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of pieces left from the total number of pieces.

40 pieces - 14 pieces left = 26 pieces taken

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

"First, let's find out how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. Since one serving has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in the bag, the whole bag has:
250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories

Now, let's see how many calories you can still eat today. Your daily target is 2000 calories, and you have already eaten 1800 calories, so:
2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

This means you can eat 200 calories worth of chips. Since the whole bag is 1250 calories and weighs 300 grams, we need to find out how many grams 200 calories would be. We can set up a proportion:
1250 calories : 300 grams = 200 calories : x grams

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:
x grams = (200 calories * 300 grams) / 1250 calories
x grams = 60000 / 1250
x grams = 48

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To find out Charlie's net profit, we need to figure out how much it costs him to make the candles and how much he earns from selling them.

First, let's see how many pounds of beeswax he needs for 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, he needs:
20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds:
2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Next, we calculate how much money Charlie makes from selling 20 candles:
20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
$40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

So, Charlie's net profit is:
$20.00"
"First, let's figure out how many articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, we need to calculate 2/5 of 5 and add that to the 5 articles she wrote on Monday:
2/5 of 5 is 2.
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:
So, on Wednesday, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up all the articles she wrote over the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice bought, we need to figure out how many she used and how many she started with.

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. After placing the Post-it notes on the cups, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

First, we need to find out how many Post-it notes she had before she used them on the coffee cups. We do this by adding the Post-it notes she had left to the number she used:

220 (used) + 23 (left) = 243 (total she had before using them)

Now, we know she started with 80 Post-it notes, so the difference between the total she had before using them and the ones she started with is the number in the package she bought:

243 (total she had) - 80 (started with) = 163

So, the package she bought had 163 Post-it notes.

"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each tie:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can find out how much John spent on the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

"First, let's find out how many units are there in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we multiply 15 by 8:

15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find out how many units are occupied, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4:

120 units * 3/4 = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

120 units - 90 units = 30 units

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

"First, let's figure out how much weight Uriah removes by taking out 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.

30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 7.5 pounds

So, Uriah removes 7.5 pounds by taking out the comic books. He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to take out the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the weight he still needs to remove by the weight of each toy:

7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound per toy = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to figure out how much weight is left for the boxes after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge can carry 5000 pounds. The driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds. So, we subtract the weight of the driver and the truck from the bridge's limit:

5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

This means there are 1245 pounds available for the boxes. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we divide the available weight by the weight of one box to find out how many boxes can be loaded:

1245 pounds รท 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

Now, we know:
- 1 orange is bad
- 5 oranges are unripe
- 2 oranges are sour

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:

4 liters + 4 liters = 8 liters

Now, the boy got 6 liters. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters

We started with 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

"Let's figure this out step by step:

1. Charlie started with 10 stickers.
2. He bought 21 more stickers, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.
3. He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.
4. Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
5. He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"First, let's find out how much Alex weighs. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. 

4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:

125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

"First, we need to find out how many roses there are in total. Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each bush has 25 roses. So, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush:

3 bushes * 25 roses/bush = 75 roses

Next, we need to find out how many thorns there are in total. Each rose has 8 thorns, so we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

75 roses * 8 thorns/rose = 600 thorns

"To solve this, let's think step by step. If the team won 8 more games than they lost, we can set up a simple equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \). Then the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is 22. So we can write:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won:
\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

"To find out how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to figure out how many vacations he has been on and then multiply that by the number of shirts he gets each year.

First, let's find out how many years he has been going on vacations:
- Gene is now 34 years old.
- He started going on vacations when he was 23 years old.
- So, the number of years he has been going on vacations is \(34 - 23 = 11\) years.

Next, we know he goes on 4 vacations each year. So, the total number of quilt blocks (or shirts) he has is:
- \(11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations per year} = 44\) quilt blocks.

"Let's figure this out step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang 4 times * 3 = 12 times.
3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang 12 times / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:
4 times + 12 times + 6 times = 22 times

"First, let's figure out Sylvie's monthly salary after 5 years in the company. Since the company increases the salary by 10% after 5 years, we need to calculate 10% of $600 and add it to the original salary.

10% of $600 is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

So, her new monthly salary after 5 years is:
\[ 600 + 60 = 660 \]

Now, we need to find out what her salary will be after 3 more years. Since the salary increase only happens once after 5 years, her monthly salary will remain $660 for the next 3 years.

To find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 660 \times 12 = 7920 \]

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:
7920"
"Let's think about this step by step. If Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can say that for every 1 copy Harald sold, Marilyn sold 10 copies. So, together, they sold 1 + 10 = 11 copies for every set of copies.

Now, if they sold 88,000 copies in total, we can divide this number by 11 to find out how many sets of 11 copies they sold. 

88,000 รท 11 = 8,000

This means Harald sold 8,000 copies, because each set of 11 copies includes 1 copy from Harald.

"First, we need to find out how many gift bags Christina actually needs. Since 1/4 of the people don't show up, that means 3/4 of the people do show up. 

16 friends invited * 3/4 showing up = 12 friends showing up.

Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest, so:

12 friends * .75 gift bags per friend = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so:

9 gift bags * $2 per gift bag = $18.

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we can break it down into two parts: the amount for the adults and the amount for the children.

First, let's figure out how much the adults will eat:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.
- So, the total for the adults is 10 lbs/adult * 20 adults = 200 lbs.

Next, let's figure out how much the children will eat:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.
- There are 5 children.
- So, the total for the children is 5 lbs/child * 5 children = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the amounts for the adults and the children together:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

"First, let's figure out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet.

If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and he used to be two seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald used to run it in:
38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. This means he can now run 10% faster than his old time. To find out how much faster, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds:
10% of 40 seconds = 0.10 * 40 seconds = 4 seconds

But this 4 seconds is the amount of time he saves, not the new time. To find his new time, we subtract this from his old time:
40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"First, let's find out how many cats there are. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can calculate the number of cats like this:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, let's find out how many rabbits there are. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So we add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract twelve:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, to find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
200 - 80 = 120 girls

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
120 * 2/3 = 80 girls in the girl scout

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
120 - 80 = 40 girls not in the girl scout

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to figure out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the original volume of the tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce.
2. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of the tomatoes was 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.
3. Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, so the number of cans Freda used is 64 / 16 = 4 cans.
4. Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes Freda used is 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

She received 18 new potted plants, so now she has:
80 plants + 18 plants = 98 plants

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away:
1 plant/ledge * 40 ledges = 40 plants

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The outer dimensions of each box are:

- Width: 6 inches
- Height: 4 inches

The inner dimensions will be:
- Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
- Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
- Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:

- On Monday, Frankie watched 1 hour.
- On Tuesday, he watched another 1 hour.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes.
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

First, let's add up the hours he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (other days) = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes long, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes make up 1.5 hours:

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to figure out how many each of them ate.

Beatrice's roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate is:
2 (width) x 24 (length) = 48 roll-ups

Marcell's roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate is:
3 (width) x 14 (length) = 42 roll-ups

Now, to find the average, we add the total number of roll-ups they both ate and divide by 2 (since there are two people).

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 (Beatrice) + 42 (Marcell) = 90 roll-ups

Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"First, let's figure out how much Sasha paid for all the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- So, 10 boards * $10 = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- So, 5 boards * $16 = $80.

Now, let's add the cost of all the boards together:
- $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, we need to find out how much she can sell the boards for now that prices have gone up by 50%.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- The new price is $10 + 50% of $10.
- 50% of $10 is $5.
- So, the new price is $10 + $5 = $15.
- For 10 boards, she can sell them for 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- The new price is $16 + 50% of $16.
- 50% of $16 is $8.
- So, the new price is $16 + $8 = $24.
- For 5 boards, she can sell them for 5 * $24 = $120.

Now, let's add the selling prices together:
- $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- $270 - $180 = $90.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $90.

"First, let's find out what Lylah's salary was four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, we can set up the equation to find Lylah's salary.

Let's call Lylah's salary four years ago \( L \).

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = L + 0.30L
$40,000 = 1.30L

Now, we solve for \( L \):

\( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \)
\( L = 30,769.23 \) (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, let's find out what Adrien's salary is four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago.

Adrien's new salary = Adrien's old salary + 40% of Adrien's old salary
Adrien's new salary = $40,000 + 0.40 * $40,000
Adrien's new salary = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's new salary = $56,000

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we can calculate her new salary by increasing her old salary by 40%.

Lylah's new salary = Lylah's old salary + 40% of Lylah's old salary
Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 + 0.40 * $30,769.23
Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
Lylah's new salary = $43,076.92

Now, we add both of their new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later.

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $99,076.92

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
2. For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less each day. So, she slept:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Tuesday
   - 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Wednesday
3. For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, she slept:
   - 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day for 4 days.

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours slept = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48 hours

"First, we need to figure out how many miles Rosie runs in the first 3 hours. Since she runs 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, we multiply 10 by 3:
10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Next, we need to find out how many miles she runs in the remaining 4 hours. After the first 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. So, we multiply 5 by 4:
5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles from the first 3 hours to the miles from the last 4 hours to get the total distance:
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

"Jennie started with 60 letters that needed stamps. She put stamps on one-third of these letters, which means she stamped 60 / 3 = 20 letters. After stamping, the pile of already-stamped letters has 30 letters. Since 20 of these were just stamped by Jennie, the pile must have had 30 - 20 = 10 letters already in it when she started.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. When she set the table, she had 12 spoons left.

We need to find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought.

First, let's figure out how many spoons Julia had before she used 3 to sample the stew. If she had 12 spoons left after using 3, then before using them, she had:
\[ 12 + 3 = 15 \text{ spoons} \]

Now, we know that the 15 spoons include the 5 spoons her husband bought. So, the number of spoons Julia originally bought is:
\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ spoons} \]

So, the package Julia bought had 10 spoons.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Each pepper costs $15.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs. So, the cost of a watermelon is:
   \[
   3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of an orange**: An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. So, the cost of an orange is:
   \[
   45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each item Dillon is buying:

1. **Total cost for 4 watermelons**:
   \[
   4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. **Total cost for 20 peppers**:

"To find out how much profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent on patients each day.
2. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the patients.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on patients each day.**

- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.

Total time spent = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Convert minutes to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors.**

- Doctors charge $150 per hour.
- The hospital spends 200 hours on patients each day.

Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the patients.**

- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
- The hospital spends 200 hours on patients each day.

Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits each day.

"First, let's figure out how many times Pam and Fred rode the rides in total.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of:
2 + 2 = 4 times

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of:
4 + 2 = 6 times

Now, let's add up the total number of rides:
4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is:
10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets

"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which means he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday. The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. So, the miles he walked on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - (Miles on Monday + Miles on Tuesday)
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - (4 + 24)
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 28
Miles walked on Wednesday = 13

"To find out how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, figure out how much Tom pays for car washes in one month. Since each car wash costs $15 and he gets 4 car washes a month, we multiply 15 by 4.
   \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \)
   So, Tom pays $60 for car washes each month.

2. Next, to find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year, which is 12.
   \( 60 \times 12 = 720 \)

So, Tom pays $720 for car washes in a year.

2 cookies * $1.00 each = $2.00

Now, let's add these together to get the total cost before the delivery fee and tip:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

"First, let's figure out how many questions Mark could complete in the time he had for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, in 8 hours, he can complete \(8 \times 5 = 40\) questions.

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
- \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions.

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, in 6 hours, he can complete \(6 \times 5 = 30\) questions.

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
- \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions.

Now, let's add the incomplete questions from both tests:
- \(35 + 70 = 105\) questions.

12 (automatic) + 4 (manual) = 16 cars

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of cars to find the number of semi-automatic cars:
20 (total cars) - 16 (automatic and manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiply by 100:
(4 / 20) * 100 = 20%

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%.

"To find out how many worker bees there are, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of queens is \( Q \).
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Now, solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"First, let's figure out which items are food and which are not. Milk and eggs are food, so they don't have tax. The other itemsโlight bulbs, cups, and roach trapsโare not food, so they have a 10% tax.

The cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total for food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items before tax:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total for nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we need to add the 10% tax to the nonfood items:
10% of $10 = $10 * 0.10 = $1

So, the total cost for the nonfood items with tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

Now, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items with tax:
$5 + $11 = $16

So, the total cost for everything is:

2 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle + 1 pack of cloths * $5 per pack = $4 + $5 = $9

Now, for 8 clients, the total expenses will be:

8 clients * $9 per client = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

$92 - $72 = $20

So, Kim will make $20 profit each week.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees half as many bees return. Half of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return.
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. Two times 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned comes back. The bees that left and didn't return are the 60 bees that left in the third period minus the 15 bees that returned in the second period. So, 60 - 15 = 45 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Steve's distance to home is 3 miles. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, Steve's distance in feet is:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Steve to get home is:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's distance to home is 2 miles, which in feet is:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Tim to get home is:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time between when Steve and Tim get home is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the cost for each type of bike and then add them all up.

First, let's figure out the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- 5 people came by with bicycles, so that's 5 bicycles.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- So, for the bicycles: 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * 25 cents/tire = 250 cents.

Next, the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came by with tricycles, so that's 3 tricycles.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- So, for the tricycles: 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * 25 cents/tire = 225 cents.

Finally, the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came by with a unicycle.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- So, for the unicycle: 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * 25 cents/tire = 25 cents.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = 250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 500 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- 500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. After the seagull and pigeons ate, the total fries eaten so far is 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
5. Let's say the number of fries left after the pigeons ate is \( x \). The raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3}x \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( x - \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{1}{3}x \).
7. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, \( \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \).
8. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}x = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]
9. So, before the raccoon ate, there were 18 fries left.
10. The raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 18 fries, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 18 = 12 \) fries.
11. Therefore, before the raccoon ate, there were 18 + 12 = 30 fries.
12. Adding the fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it is 30 (remaining) + 30 (eaten) = 60 fries.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends each week and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days he has classes:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long. So, each of these days, he spends:
  3 classes * 1 hour/class = 3 hours/day

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. So, each of these days, he spends:
  2 classes * 2 hours/class = 4 hours/day

Next, let's find the total hours per week:
- He has 3 hours on each of the 3 days (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays):
  3 days * 3 hours/day = 9 hours

- He has 4 hours on each of the 2 days (Tuesdays and Thursdays):
  2 days * 4 hours/day = 8 hours

- Adding these together gives the total hours per week:
  9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours/week

Now, let's calculate the total hours for the semester:
- There are 16 weeks in the semester, so:
  17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

"First, let's figure out how long all the rolls are when put end to end. Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

Next, for the chocolate croissants. Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

For the baguettes, each is 2 feet long, and Bill bakes 60 baguettes. So, the total length of the baguettes is:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we need to add up all the lengths, but first, we need to convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet (for the rolls)
720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet (for the croissants)

Now, we add all the lengths together:
100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is 280 feet.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many of each type of fish Anakin and Locsin caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught together.

Total starfish:
- Anakin: 10
- Locsin: 5
- Total: 10 + 5 = 15

Total sea horses:
- Anakin: 6
- Locsin: 3
- Total: 6 + 3 = 9

Total clownfish:
- Anakin: 3
- Locsin: 5
- Total: 3 + 5 = 8

Now, let's add up all the fish:
- Total fish: 15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32

So, the total number of fish they caught is 32.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every 2 months, we divide 36 by 2:
36 รท 2 = 18

So, the price will increase 18 times.

Next, we need to find out what 20% of the original price is:
20% of $20 = 0.20 ร 20 = $4

Each time the price increases, it goes up by $4. But it's not just adding $4 each time; it's increasing by 20% of the new price each time. This means we need to use a formula for compound interest, which is similar to how prices increase in this problem.

The formula is:
Final Price = Original Price ร (1 + Rate of Increase) ^ Number of Increases

In this case:
- Original Price = $20
- Rate of Increase = 20% = 0.20
- Number of Increases = 18

So, we plug in the numbers:
Final Price = 20 ร (1 + 0.20) ^ 18
Final Price = 20 ร (1.20) ^ 18

Now, we need to calculate (1.20) ^ 18:
(1.20) ^ 18 โ 38.3376

Finally, we multiply this by the original price:
Final Price = 20 ร 38.3376 โ 766.752

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:
766.75

766.75"
"First, let's find out how much the doll costs. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
3 action figures * $5 per action figure = $15

Next, we know that one red car costs $4, so 5 red cars cost:
5 red cars * $4 per red car = $20

Now, we have 3 action figures, and each costs $5, so:
3 action figures * $5 per action figure = $15

Adding up the costs of all the toys:
Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of the doll
$20 + $15 + $15 = $50

So, all the toys are worth $50.

"To figure out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the money she loses by doing the taxes herself.

First, let's calculate how much money Jackie loses if she does the taxes herself:
- She loses 3 hours of freelance work.
- She earns $35 per hour.

So, the total money lost is:
3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Next, let's look at the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Now, we compare the two:
- Money lost by doing taxes herself: $105
- Cost of hiring the accountant: $90

To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the money she would lose by doing it herself:
$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Now, let's add these amounts together:

1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423

Elvira's total budget is โฌ1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

1500 - 1423 = 77

So, Elvira will have โฌ77 left for her clothing.

"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to figure out how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan needs 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3.

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide 45 by 9.

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysit = 5

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Let's think about this step by step. If Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can say:

Seth's age = 2 ร Brooke's age

In 2 years, both Seth and Brooke will be 2 years older. So, if we add 2 to both of their current ages, the sum will be 28. We can write this as:

(Seth's age + 2) + (Brooke's age + 2) = 28

Now, let's substitute Seth's age with 2 times Brooke's age:

(2 ร Brooke's age + 2) + (Brooke's age + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3 ร Brooke's age + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3 ร Brooke's age = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

Brooke's age = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:

Seth's age = 2 ร 8 = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much each uniform costs in total, we need to add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.

1. The hat costs $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated by adding the cost of the hat and the jacket and then dividing by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants:

Next, the legs of the insects:
90 insects ร 6 legs each = 540 legs

Then, the legs of the rare mutant invertebrates:
3 invertebrates ร 10 legs each = 30 legs

"First, let's find out how much Jessica pays each month if she pays 50% more than the minimum for each debt.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more = $300 * 0.50 = $150
Total payment = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more = $200 * 0.50 = $100
Total payment = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more = $500 * 0.50 = $250
Total payment = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the total monthly payment for all debts:
Total monthly payment = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (months in a year):

- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, it will take 1.5 minutes ร 60 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's find the total time to cut all the potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, it will take 5 seconds ร 60 = 300 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the cutting time into minutes:
- 300 seconds รท 60 seconds/minute = 5 minutes.

"First, let's figure out how many gallons of lemonade Juan and Carlos sold. 

They make $0.50 per glass and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.

If they made $25 in profit, we need to find out how much they spent and how much they earned in total.

The cost to make one gallon is $3 for lemons + $2 for sugar = $5.

Let's say they sold x gallons. Their total earnings would be $10 * x, and their total cost would be $5 * x.

Their profit is their total earnings minus their total cost, so:
$10 * x - $5 * x = $25
$5 * x = $25
x = $25 / $5
x = 5 gallons

They sold 5 gallons. Since the cost for lemons is $3 per gallon, they spent $3 * 5 = $15 on lemons.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
6000$ * 1/3 = 2000$ on car fuel.

Now, let's add the rent and car fuel expenses:
1500$ + 2000$ = 3500$.

Next, we find out how much money is left after paying for rent and car fuel:
6000$ - 3500$ = 2500$.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the total time for the well-rounded team:
- Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 runners.
- Total time = 55 seconds/runner * 4 runners = 220 seconds.

Next, we calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
- The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now, we find the difference in their times:
- Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team wins by 2 seconds.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since these are independent events, the probability of both events happening (rolling two even numbers in a row) is:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

3. **Rabbits**: 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
4. **Total straw**: 160 pieces of straw are distributed in total.

First, let's calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters.
- Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

Next, let's calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:
- Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's find out how much straw is used for the rats:
- Total straw used = 160 pieces.
- Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces.
- Straw used for rabbits = 20 pieces.
- Straw used for rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw.

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's find out how many rats there are in total:
- Total rats = 90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups:
- Rats per cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. So, in the third month, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards she has:
- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320

"First, we need to figure out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence

For 500 sentences, Mark earns from Publisher B:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we add the earnings from both publishers to find out how much Mark makes in a week:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial Weekly Salary**: John makes $2000 a week.
2. **Annual Salary Before the Award**: Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary before the award is:
   \[
   2000 \times 52 = 104,000
   \]

3. **Monetary Reward**: John gets a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

4. **Salary Increase**: John gets a 5% raise in his salary. The new weekly salary is:
   \[
   2000 + (2000 \times 0.05) = 2000 + 100 = 2100
   \]

5. **Annual Salary After the Raise**: Since the raise is effective from the first day of the year, his new annual salary is:
   \[
   2100 \times 52 = 109,200
   \]

6. **Total Money Made in the Year**: Adding the one-time monetary reward to the new annual salary:
   \[
   109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

"First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie gets from her farm each year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we multiply 5 tons by 10 acres.

5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons of grapes

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine these grapes can make. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply the total tons of grapes by 2.

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine

So, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"Let's break it down:

- Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese each day. So, for sandwiches, he used:
  7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

- For breakfast, he had omelets 3 days, using 1 more slice than he did per sandwich (which was 2 slices). So, he used 3 slices per omelet:
  3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

- For the macaroni and cheese, he used 8 slices.

Now, let's add all the cheese slices together:
14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni) = 31 slices

"First, let's find out how many blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag has 9 pens. So, 6 bags times 9 pens per bag is 54 blue pens.

Next, let's find out how many red pens she bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag has 6 pens. So, 2 bags times 6 pens per bag is 12 red pens.

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, which is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Adding the blue pens and red pens she bought, we get 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.

So, Janet has 98 pens now.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we first need to figure out what her total score should be after dropping the lowest score.

1. First, we add up the scores of the first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.
2. The lowest score among these is 71.
3. If we drop the lowest score (71), the total of the remaining scores is 438 - 71 = 367.
4. To have an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score, the total of the five highest scores should be 93 * 5 = 465.
5. Therefore, the score Brinley needs on the sixth test is 465 - 367 = 98.

"First, let's figure out how many kilometers Michael rode in the first four weeks. He rode 5 times a week and each time he rode 25 kilometers.

So, in one week, he rode:
5 times * 25 kilometers = 125 kilometers

For four weeks, he rode:
125 kilometers/week * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

Next, let's figure out how many kilometers he rode in the following three weeks. He rode 2 times a week and each time he rode 60 kilometers.

So, in one week, he rode:
2 times * 60 kilometers = 120 kilometers

For three weeks, he rode:
120 kilometers/week * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

Now, let's add the kilometers from both periods to find the total:
500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

"First, we need to find out how much each candied apple weighs. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple must weigh 40g / 2 = 20g.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40g, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, and each weighs 20g, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy. The total weight is 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"First, let's figure out how much half a dozen plates cost. Since one plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:

6 plates * $6000/plate = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

$36000 - $1200 = $34800

Since twenty dozen cups are 240 cups (because one dozen equals 12 cups), we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups:

$34800 / 240 cups = $145

So, the cost of each cup is $145.

"First, let's find out how much money Sara needs to buy the jacket and the shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so that's 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, she needs $60 - $20 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs by what she earns per lawn mowed: $40 / $4 = 10.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times.

"Let's think about this step by step. If we call the number of red chickens R, then the number of white chickens is R + 2 because Jerry has two more white chickens than red ones.

Each red chicken gives 3 eggs, so R red chickens give 3R eggs.
Each white chicken gives 5 eggs, so (R + 2) white chickens give 5(R + 2) eggs.

Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so we can write the equation:
3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Now, let's solve for R:
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
8R + 10 = 42
8R = 42 - 10
8R = 32
R = 32 / 8
R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to figure out the total distance he walks around the park. Since the park is a rectangle, we can find the perimeter by adding up all the sides. The park measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles, so it has two sides that are 1.5 miles each and two sides that are 6 miles each.

The total distance (perimeter) is:
2 * 1.5 miles + 2 * 6 miles = 3 miles + 12 miles = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:

15 miles รท 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. The next day, she counted 50 more than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers. By the third day, the total number of customers was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to add the customers from the first two days and subtract that from the total.

So, 100 (first day) + 150 (second day) = 250 customers in the first two days. 

Now, 500 (total) - 250 (first two days) = 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's think about this step by step.

1. **Understanding the leak rate**: Both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute.

2. **Time frame**: 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

3. **Leakage over 4 minutes**: In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

4. **Setting up the equations**:
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now.
   - Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now.
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

5. **Relationships**:
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
     \[
     B = 4S
     \]

6. **Solving the equations**:
   - Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2S + 32
     \]
   - Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
     \[
     2S + 16 = 32
     \]
   - Subtract 16 from both sides:
     \[
     2S = 16
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     S = 8
     \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"First, we need to find out how much money Lori needs in total. She wants to buy shoes for $320.00 and a belt for $32.00. So, we add these two amounts together:

$320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Now, we know Lori earns $8.00 for each hour she works. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage:

$352.00 รท $8.00 = 44

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt.

"First, let's find out how much Janeth has to pay back in total. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. 

10% of $2000 is $200 (because 10/100 * 2000 = 200).

So, the total amount she has to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, if she pays $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find out her remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she has to pay back: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

Adrian in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years old
Harriet in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years old
Zack in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years old

To find the average age in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

"First, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we need to find out how many candies James has. James has 6 more candies than Robert. Since Robert has 27 candies, we add 6 to 27 to find out how many candies James has.

27 + 6 = 33

So, James has 33 candies.

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies. We subtract 33 from 54 to find the difference.

54 - 33 = 21

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So now he is a pen pal with:
   5 - 2 = 3 people

2. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives each week is:
   3 people * 2 letters/person * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages

3. Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages each week.

4. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing 30 pages, we multiply:
   30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

5. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week.

"First, let's figure out how many minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss. He talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, we multiply 15 minutes by 30 days:

15 minutes/day ร 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the 1000 minutes he has in his plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   - Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle.
   - Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
   - Griffin now has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   - Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
   - Griffin now has 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
5. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and in the end, Griffin had 27 fries.
   - Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin ""x"".
   - So, 7 + x = 27.

Now, we solve for x:
7 + x = 27
x = 27 - 7
x = 20

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To find out how many fish are in each aquarium, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of snails in each aquarium:**
   - First aquarium: 4 snails
   - Second aquarium: 32 snails

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails:**
   - Difference = 32 snails - 4 snails = 28 snails

3. **Understand the relationship between the difference in snails and the number of fish:**
   - The difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.
   - Total number of fish in both aquariums = \( 2f \)
   - According to the problem, 28 = 2 * (2f)

5. **Solve for \( f \):**
   - 28 = 4f
   - \( f = \frac{28}{4} \)
   - \( f = 7 \)

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"First, let's figure out how much the makeup artist charges for one day. The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day. So, for one day, it costs:
\[ 250 \times 6 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much it costs for one week. Since the makeup is done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is:
\[ 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30,000:
\[ 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Jean pays after the discount is:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to add up all the costs Isabelle had for the party supplies. 

The cost of the ingredients for the cake is $12.
The cost of the birthday presents is $43.
The cost of the decorations is $15.
The cost of the invitations is $4.
The cost of the goodie bags is $22.

Now, we add these amounts together:
$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

The total cost is $96. Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, that means the cost is split three ways. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:
$96 รท 3 = $32

Each person paid $32.

"First, we need to find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, we multiply 4 by 50:

4 * 50 = 200 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much the chef spent. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so we multiply the total pounds by $1.50:

200 * 1.50 = 300

The chef spent $300.

"First, let's figure out how many cookies Sue ate each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate:
4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate:
2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Now, let's add up the total cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies

Her sister's total cookies:
5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Next, we calculate the total calories each of them consumed. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories:

Sue's total calories:
46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories

Her sister's total calories:
18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

Now, we find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
9200 calories - 3600 calories = 5600 calories

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is:
   \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) students.

2. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are:
   \( 60 \times 0.5 = 30 \) girls and \( 60 \times 0.5 = 30 \) boys.

3. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is:
   \( 15 + 12 = 27 \) girls.

4. Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is:
   \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) girls.

5. Each class has 20 students, so the number of boys in the third class is:
   \( 20 - 3 = 17 \) boys.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that last night Rick killed:
- 10 wolves
- 15 cougars

Today, Rick killed:
- Three times as many wolves as cougars
- Three fewer cougars than the previous night

So, today Rick killed:
- Cougars: 15 - 3 = 12 cougars
- Wolves: 3 times the number of cougars, so 3 * 12 = 36 wolves

Now, let's add up all the animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

Total animals killed:
25 + 48 = 73

30 - 9 = 21 times

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply Anne's number by 4:
21 * 4 = 84

Robert went down the slide 84 times.

"First, let's figure out how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot tall redwood tree. We do this by dividing 200 by 10:
200 รท 10 = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree before the termites ate it would be:
20 sections ร 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

The termites ate 30% of the tree, so they removed:
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 ร 8000 = 2400 pounds

To find the weight of the tree after the termites ate it, we subtract the weight the termites removed from the original weight:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate it is 5600 pounds.

2. **First Scene**: The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines. Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has \(108 \div 3 = 36\) lines in the first scene.
3. **Second Scene**: The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has \(60 \times \frac{4}{5} = 48\) lines in the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

"To find out how long it will take Matthew to dig all the holes, we first need to calculate the total time for the small holes and the large holes separately, and then add them together.

For the small holes:
- It takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- So, for 30 small holes, it will take \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

For the large holes:
- It takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- So, for 15 large holes, it will take \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes together:
- Total time in minutes = \(90 + 150 = 240\) minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"First, let's find out how much Peter paid for the popsicles. He bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so:
20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00

Next, let's find out how much he paid for the ice cream bars. He bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so:
4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00

Now, let's add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount he paid:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid $7.00 in total.

"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and that is twice as many as a mamba, we divide 70 by 2:
70 / 2 = 35 spots for a mamba.

Now, let's calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras:
40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas:
60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the spots of all the cobras and mambas together to get the total number of spots:
2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots.

Finally, we need to find half the number of spots they all have combined:
4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots.

"First, let's figure out how many people are coming to the soccer game.

There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
Adding the 12 team members, we have 12 + 24 = 36 people.
We also have 3 coaches, so in total, there are 36 + 3 = 39 people.

Now, we need to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by 3:
39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 13 * 15 = $195.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to figure out the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then see how much space is left for the beads.

1. First, we know each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. If 8 inches are taken by the topaz gemstones, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is:
   - \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

3. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so to find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 0.25 (which is the same as multiplying by 4):
   - \(17 \div 0.25 = 17 \times 4 = 68\).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled their number of stories.

So, in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote 20 + 40 = 60 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 + 80 = 120 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 + 120 = 180 stories.

Adding all these together, the total number of stories is:

"First, let's figure out how much money Kelly has in total.

A quarter is worth 25 cents. Kelly has 5 quarters, so:
5 quarters ร 25 cents = 125 cents

A dime is worth 10 cents. Kelly has 2 dimes, so:
2 dimes ร 10 cents = 20 cents

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find out the total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"First, let's figure out how many stars are in the rows we know about.

There are three rows of 8 stars each:
3 rows ร 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars each:
2 rows ร 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, let's add these together to find out how many stars are already accounted for:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Now, to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
40 stars รท 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

"First, let's find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars.

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Next, we need to see how many chocolate bars the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each gets 6 chocolate bars.

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children.

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them.

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"First, let's figure out how long Susan works. She starts at 8 a.m. and stops at 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. But she takes a break for half an hour, so she works for 2 and a half hours.

Now, 2 and a half hours is the same as 2 hours and 30 minutes. Since 1 hour has 60 minutes, 2 hours have 120 minutes. Adding the 30 minutes, she works for 150 minutes in total.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute periods are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10, which gives us 15.

So, if she earns $5 for each 10-minute period, and there are 15 such periods, she earns 15 times $5.

15 times 5 is 75.

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know how many points each player has after 3 rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Next, we need to see if any of them get an extra point in the fourth round:
- Mike has 21 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, we add up all the points:
- Mike has 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 43 points.

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 5 people eating rice twice a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by all 5 people.
   - Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - So, 5 people will eat \( 5 \times 0.2 = 1 \) kg of rice per meal.

2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
   - They eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).
   - So, 5 people will eat \( 1 \times 2 = 2 \) kg of rice per day.

3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 5 people will eat \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) kg of rice per week.

4. Calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last.

"First, let's figure out how many miles John travels in a year.

John travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day. That's 60 miles a day.

He goes to work 5 days a week, so in one week, he travels:
60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week

He works 50 weeks a year, so in one year, he travels:
300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, he gets charged $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, he pays:
15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

He also gives his driver a $150 bonus each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus he gives in a year is:
$150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to figure out how many books she sold each year and then calculate the earnings for the second year.

1. **Total books initially**: 250
2. **Books sold in the current year (third year)**: 45
3. **Books unsold**: 50

First, let's find out how many books were sold in the first two years:
- Total books sold = Total books initially - Books unsold
- Total books sold = 250 - 50 = 200

Next, we know the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year:
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold in the current year
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * 45 = 90

Now, we can find out how many books were sold in the second year:
- Books sold in the second year = Total books sold - (Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the current year)
- Books sold in the second year = 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - So, Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - If Noah was 20 years old six years ago, he is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - So, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

5. **Population of Chile Now:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's think about this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).
2. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
3. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the defense, offense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, let's add these together:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} \]

To make it easier, let's convert \( 3D \) to a fraction with the same denominator:
\[ 3D = \frac{6D}{2} \]

So now we have:
\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

This equals 105:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

She invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's:
2 families * 6 people/family = 12 people

She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's:
3 families * 4 people/family = 12 people

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:

"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to first figure out how many cubic feet of water the pool can hold. We do this by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool.

The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.

So, the volume of the pool is:
6 feet (length) x 4 feet (width) x 5 feet (depth) = 120 cubic feet

Now, it costs $0.1 to fill each cubic foot. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot:

120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot = $12

To find the number of electric poles, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio:
1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1 \text{ pole} \times 45 \text{ wires}}{3 \text{ wires}} \]
\[ x = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ x = 15 \]

"First, let's find out how many people were at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so:

25 men + 15 women = 40 people

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people is:

40 people รท 4 = 10 people

This means 10 people left the party. If 22 men stayed, we need to figure out how many men left. At the beginning, there were 25 men, so:

25 men - 22 men = 3 men left

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the rest must have been women. So, 10 - 3 = 7 women left.

At the beginning, there were 15 women, so the number of women left is:

15 women - 7 women = 8 women

"First, let's find out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. Jam has 26 pencils in total, and 2 of those are loose. So, the pencils in the boxes are:

26 - 2 = 24 pencils

Since these 24 pencils are in 3 boxes, each box has:

24 รท 3 = 8 pencils

Now, let's find out how many boxes Meg needs for her 46 pencils. If each box holds 8 pencils, then:

46 รท 8 = 5 remainder 6

This means Meg needs 5 full boxes and 1 more box for the 6 extra pencils, so she needs 6 boxes in total.

Adding Jam's 3 boxes and Meg's 6 boxes, they need:

3 + 6 = 9 boxes

"To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannonโs iced coffee is, we need to figure out two things: how many ice cubes she uses and how much the cream adds to the weakening.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee.

So, the total amount the coffee is weakened is:

\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

"To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to remember that for every new record they get, they have to give 2 old records. 

If 5 people left with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records by multiplying the number of new records by 2.

So, 7 new records ร 2 old records per new record = 14 old records.

"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.

Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since there are 40 junior programmers, the rest must be senior programmers.

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers is:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Pay per junior programmer
Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * 2000 = $80,000

Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer, so their pay is:

Pay per senior programmer = Pay per junior programmer + $400
Pay per senior programmer = 2000 + 400 = $2400

The total amount paid to senior programmers is:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Pay per senior programmer
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * 2400 = $144,000

Now, we add the total amounts paid to junior and senior programmers to find the total amount paid to all programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
Total amount paid to all programmers = 80,000 + 144,000 = $224,000

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so now there are \( x + 5 \) people on the bus.
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).
4. Simplifying that, we get \( x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
5. We know that at the third stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He gives 14 to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.
5. After buying more, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
6. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To solve this, we need to figure out how much more charge the phone needs and then how long it will take to get that charge.

1. The phone is currently at 60% and needs to reach 100%. So, it needs 40% more charge.
2. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point every 3 minutes. So, to charge 40 percentage-points, it will take 40 * 3 minutes.
3. 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.
4. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
5. 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"First, let's figure out how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they get $1 off. So, $80 divided by $20 is 4. This means they earned $4 in rewards.

Now, for this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 in rewards, and the coupon took off twice the amount of the rewards, which is $4 times 2, equaling $8.

So, the total discount is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

To find out how much they paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:
- Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year.
- Total annual pay for Job A: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax on $30,000 is: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Now, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:
- Job B pays $42,000 a year.
- The state charges $6,000 in property tax.
- After property tax, the net income is: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax on $36,000 is: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay:
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Difference: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

- Total cost for Furniture United: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Next, let's calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can break it down into two parts:

1. Calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
   - Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
   - For 8 batches, he will need \(30 \times 8 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

2. Calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
   - Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
   - For 1 batch, he will need \(70 \times 1 = 70\) ounces of sugar.

Now, add the sugar needed for both the suckers and the fudge:

"First, let's figure out how much Maria paid for the shares. She bought 8 shares at $8 each, so:

8 shares * $8/share = $64

Next, the stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share, we calculate:

$8 * 50% = $8 * 0.50 = $4

So the new price per share is:

$8 + $4 = $12

Now, in the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. We need to find 25% of $12:

$12 * 25% = $12 * 0.25 = $3

So the new price per share after the decrease is:

$12 - $3 = $9

Finally, to find the total value of all Maria's shares, we multiply the new price per share by the number of shares:

8 shares * $9/share = $72

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72.

"Let's think about this step by step. We have 200 students in total, and they are split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups \( x \). The smallest group, then, has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

The total number of animals is 60, so:
\[C + 2C = 60\]
\[3C = 60\]
\[C = 20\]

So, there are 20 cows and \(2 \times 20 = 40\) chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:

"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings when they made tractors.
2. Calculate the daily earnings now that they make silos.
3. Find the difference in daily earnings.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original daily earnings from tractors.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily earnings from tractors.**
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.
- Daily earnings from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

**Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from silos.**
- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.
- Daily earnings from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

**Step 3: Find the difference in daily earnings.**
- Difference = Daily earnings from silos - Daily earnings from tractors
- Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**
- Percentage increase = (Difference / Original daily earnings from tractors) * 100
- Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how old Carver's son is, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given. 

Let's say Carver's son's age is \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We know Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's find out how many miles the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, so that's 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's add up all the distances for one complete trip:
75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance is:
300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so to find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed needs. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. The average is:

\( \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds for a collie bed.

Now, for 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs:

\( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) pounds of stuffing.

For 3 collie beds, Mark needs:

\( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) pounds of stuffing.

Adding these together, Mark needs:

\( 8 + 15 = 23 \) pounds of stuffing in total.

"First, let's figure out how long it took John to drive to his friend's house. The trip was 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles, so the total distance to his friend's house was 210 miles. He drove at 70 mph.

To find the time, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the trip to his friend's house:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's figure out how long it took him to drive back home. The route home was 240 miles, and he drove at 80 mph.

For the trip back home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time for both parts of the trip:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks:**
   - 3 people

2. **Number of people kicked out for shoplifting:**
   - This is four times the number of people who refused to wear masks, minus 5.
   - \( 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \) people

3. **Number of people kicked out for physical violence:**
   - This is three times the number of shoplifters.
   - \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) people

4. **Total number of people kicked out:**
   - 50 people

5. **Number of people kicked out for other reasons:**
   - Total number of people kicked out minus the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to figure out the difference between her current points and the points she scored recently.

First, we know that Sara has 8 points. Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which means:

Erin's points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's points = 3 * 8
Erin's points = 24

Erin scored 14 points recently, so to find out how many points she had before, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her current total:

Points Erin had before = Erin's current points - Points scored recently
Points Erin had before = 24 - 14
Points Erin had before = 10

"First, let's figure out the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, so:
44 frames * $20/frame = $880

Next, we need to add the etching cost, which is 20% more for each frame. So, 20% of $20 is:
$20 * 20% = $4

So, the total cost for each etched frame is:
$20 + $4 = $24

Now, the total cost for 44 etched frames is:
44 frames * $24/frame = $1056

For the 2 seniors who will also receive pins, the cost of the pins is:
2 pins * $5/pin = $10

Now, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so:
44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers

The cost for the cords for the officers is:
11 officers * $12/cord = $132

Finally, we add all the costs together:
$1056 (frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:
$1198"

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday. So, they sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.
3. On Sunday, they sold half the amount they sold on Saturday. So, they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
4. But on Sunday, 6 people returned their pairs. So, the store actually sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold over the weekend:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs.

"First, we need to find out how much the faulty equipment was worth. Since 40% of the equipment was faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000.

40% of $400,000 = 0.40 ร $400,000 = $160,000

This means the faulty equipment was worth $160,000. Now, to find out how much the functioning equipment was worth, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value of the equipment.

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

"First, let's figure out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. She can make 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, 3 pitchers times 12 cups per pitcher equals 36 cups of lemonade.

Next, we need to find out how much money Millie makes from selling all the lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so 36 cups times $1 per cup equals $36.

Now, we need to find out how much profit Millie makes. Profit is the money she makes minus the money she spent. She made $36 and spent $18, so $36 minus $18 equals $18 profit.

To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we need to know how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. She sells 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups to sell. So, 36 cups divided by 4 cups per hour equals 9 hours.

   - Number of bags of flour needed: 12 cups รท 2 cups per bag = 6 bags
   - Number of bottles of milk needed: 4 cups รท 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

3. Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.
   - Number of bags of flour: 6
   - Number of bottles of milk: 2
   - Difference: 6 - 2 = 4

4

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk."
"First, let's figure out how much energy Mel uses with the air conditioner each day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts, which is the same as 0.9 kilowatts (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts).

If Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the energy used each day is:
0.9 kilowatts * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours

If Mel reduces the time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day

The energy used with the reduced time is:
0.9 kilowatts * 3 hours = 2.7 kilowatt-hours

The energy saved each day is:
7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

"First, let's find out how many stripes all the zebras have together.

Two zebras with 17 stripes each:
2 * 17 = 34 stripes

One zebra with 36 stripes:
36 stripes

Another zebra with half as many stripes as the one with 36 stripes:
36 / 2 = 18 stripes

Now, let's add all the stripes together:
34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
88 / 4 = 22

"To figure out how much Tyson will spend, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Tyson needs to serve 20 people.
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - So, the number of sandwiches needed is \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \) sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, he will need \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds of meat and \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds of cheese.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - For 5 pounds, the cost is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - For 5 pounds, the cost is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.
   - Total cost = \( 35 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

So, Tyson will spend 50 dollars on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, let's figure out how many corns Allan has. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, he has:
2 * 40 = 80 corns

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has:
40 + 60 = 100 cannolis

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so he bought:
100 - 40 = 60 corns

Adding these 60 corns to the 80 corns he already had, he now has:
80 + 60 = 140 corns

Now, to find the total number of corns and cannolis, we add the corns and cannolis together:
140 corns + 100 cannolis = 240

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps in a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps to and from school.
3. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Now, let's add up the steps he has already taken:
- Steps to and from school: 5,000
- Steps with his friend: 1,000

So, before his jog, he had taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, he must have taken:
10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps before and during his jog.

So, the steps he took during his jog are:
8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"First, let's figure out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, the time it takes to read the book is:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, the total time he needs to leave is:
60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading and have:
50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"First, let's figure out how much the company paid in May. 

In May, there were 40 employees, and each worked 40 hours a week at $15 per hour. 

To find the weekly pay for one employee:
40 hours * $15/hour = $600

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly pay for one employee is:
$600 * 4 = $2400

For 40 employees, the total pay in May is:
$2400 * 40 = $96,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees who left is:
40 * 1/4 = 10

The number of employees who stayed is:
40 - 10 = 30

The total pay for the 30 employees in June is:
$2400 * 30 = $72,000

Now, let's add the total pay for May and June:
$96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000

$168,000"
"First, let's figure out how much Sally spent on the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, for the first pound, she pays $3. For the second pound, she pays half of $3, which is $1.50. 

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
$3 + $1.50 = $4.50

Next, she bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, she bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each. The total cost for the magnets is:
4 * $0.25 = $1.00

Now, let's add up all her expenses:
$4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00

Sally started with $10. So, the amount of money she has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00

"First, let's find out how much the second pack of fireworks costs. It's twice the cost of the first pack, so:
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Now, let's add the cost of both packs of fireworks:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these packs. To find the discount amount:
\[ 1200 \times 0.20 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the packs:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, add the cost of the finale firework:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:
1110"
"Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. For 30 days, she will need:

2 cookies/night ร 30 nights = 60 cookies

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candles both explode and smell like wet dog.

1. First, we need to find out how many candles are expected to explode. Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them might explode.
   - 1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have this defect.
   - 5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"First, we need to find out how much each blouse costs after the 30% discount. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20. A 30% discount means the price is reduced by 30% of $20. 

30% of $20 is calculated as:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount on each blouse is $6. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the discounted price:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Each blouse now costs $14 after the discount. 

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price by 4:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Apples Joanne gathers:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: 30 / 2 = 15 apples
   - From the average trees: Let's call this number \( x \).

2. **Apples Joanne's sister gathers:**
   - From the tallest trees: 2 * 30 = 60 apples
   - From the shortest trees: 3 * 15 = 45 apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Joanne's total: 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + \( x \) (average)
   - Sister's total: 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) + 0 (average)

4. **Combined total:**
   - Combined total = Joanne's total + Sister's total
   - 500 = (30 + 15 + \( x \)) + (60 + 45 + 0)
   - 500 = 30 + 15 + \( x \) + 60 + 45
   - 500 = 150 + \( x \)

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - 500 - 150 = \( x \)
   - \( x \) = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, let's think step by step.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of camels.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Each camel and dromedary has one head, so the total number of heads is \( C + D = 180 \).
   - Each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, so the total number of humps is \( 2C + D = 304 \).

3. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - From the first equation: \( D = 180 - C \).
   - Substitute \( D \) in the second equation: \( 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \).

4. **Simplify and solve for \( C \):**
   - \( 2C + 180 - C = 304 \)
   - \( C + 180 = 304 \)
   - \( C = 304 - 180 \)
   - \( C = 124 \)

5. **Find \( D \):**
   - \( D = 180 - C \)
   - \( D = 180 - 124 \)
   - \( D = 56 \)

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - 4 days * 200 kilometers/day = 800 kilometers

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 = 240 kilometers

3. On the next day, he didn't travel at all.
   - 0 kilometers

4. During the second week (7 days), he traveled 300 kilometers each day.

Now, let's add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

"First, let's find out how many cats the boats took away. Four boats came and each took 5 cats, so that's 4 times 5, which is 20 cats.

Now, we started with 50 cats. If 20 cats were taken away by the boats, we have 50 minus 20, which is 30 cats left on the rock.

Next, 3/5 of these remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many that is, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30. 

3/5 of 30 is the same as 30 divided by 5, which is 6, and then 6 times 3, which is 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. 

Now, we had 30 cats left on the rock, and 18 ran away, so we subtract 18 from 30, which gives us 12 cats left on the rock.

"To find out how much 2 years of the service cost Bill, we need to break it down into the different periods and add up the costs.

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 a month.
   - 6 months * $8/month = $48

2. For the next 8 months, the cost is $12 a month.
   - 8 months * $12/month = $96

3. After these 14 months, there are 10 months left in the 2-year period (24 months total - 14 months already accounted for).
   - 10 months * $14/month = $140

"First, let's find out how much the jogger jeans cost. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less, so:

Jogger jeans cost = $28 - $6 = $22

Now, Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, so:

Savings from jogger jeans = 1/3 * $6 = $2

The rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans, so:

Savings from tattered jeans = $6 - $2 = $4

To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to add the savings to the sale prices. The original price of the jogger jeans is:

Original price of jogger jeans = $22 + $2 = $24

The original price of the tattered jeans is:

Original price of tattered jeans = $28 + $4 = $32

Now, we find the difference between the original prices:

Difference = $32 - $24 = $8

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which in this case is actually $8 less, so the answer is:

$8 less, but since the question asks ""how much more,"" the numerical answer is:

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- There are 4 buses.
- So, the total capacity of the buses is \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees.

Next, let's calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- There are 6 minibusses.
- So, the total capacity of the minibusses is \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees.

Then, let's calculate the capacity of the minivans:
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- There are 10 minivans.
- So, the total capacity of the minivans is \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
- Total capacity = capacity of buses + capacity of minibusses + capacity of minivans
- Total capacity = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how many cards he sold and how many he kept.

First, we know Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 extra, so he made:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he sells each card for $1.5, the number of cards he sold is:
\[ 150 \div 1.5 = 100 \text{ cards} \]

Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards. If 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection, then the total number of cards he started with is:
\[ 100 \div \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \text{ cards} \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. So, half of 36 is 18 guests.
3. This means he prepared 18 guests ร 2 hotdogs = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who might want two.
4. He also prepared 18 guests ร 1 hotdog = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests who would only have one.
5. In total, he prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog:
1. Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs, so that's 40 ร 2 = 80 hotdogs needed.
2. The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.

To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog:
1. The caterer had 54 hotdogs, and each guest needs 2 hotdogs.
2. 54 hotdogs can serve 54 รท 2 = 27 guests with 2 hotdogs each.
3. Since 40 guests showed up, 40 - 27 = 13 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"First, let's figure out how much money George had left after his purchase. If he had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money. 

George spent $5, which is 99% of his total money. To find out how much 1% is, we divide $5 by 99:
\[ 1\% = \frac{5}{99} \approx 0.0505 \]

So, the total amount of money George had initially is:
\[ 100\% = 5 + 0.0505 \approx 5.0505 \]

Now, let's calculate how much George spent on the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \text{ bags of chips} \times 40 \text{ cents per bag} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount he spent:
\[ 5.00 - 1.20 = 3.80 \text{ dollars} \]

This $3.80 is the amount George spent on candy bars. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we divide the total spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

Sitti has 34 oranges.
Juris has 22 oranges.

34 + 22 = 56 oranges in total.

Now, they want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. So, there are 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people in total.

To find out how many oranges each person gets, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people.

56 รท 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges.

"First, let's figure out how many pounds of onions Antoine will use. The recipe calls for 2 pounds, but he likes to double that, so he will use:
2 pounds ร 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, it will cost:
4 pounds ร $2.00/pound = $8.00.

Next, he needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
2 boxes ร $2.00/box = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:
$8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:
$12.00 รท 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

"First, let's figure out how long it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes and Bernadette's drive is four times as long, we multiply Wayne's time by 4:

4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, he will arrive in 4 minutes. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before his 4-minute travel time:

4 minutes - 5 minutes = -1 minute

This means Bernadette needs to arrive 1 minute after Wayne starts his trip. Since it takes her 16 minutes to drive, she needs to leave 16 minutes before she arrives. To arrive 1 minute after Wayne starts his trip, she needs to leave:

16 minutes + 1 minute = 17 minutes

So, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes before Wayne.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, 3 yards is equal to 9 feet.

The area of the room is given as 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. We know the length is 9 feet, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]

To find the width, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads = 3 ร 20 = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads = 4 ร 20 = 80 beads

Total beads Margareth bought = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
140 - 60 = 80

"First, let's figure out how much the temperature goes up when Marcus bakes. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the temperature goes up by 5 degrees.

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

So, the temperature after baking is:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, in 30 minutes, the house will cool down:

30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

So, the temperature after opening the window is:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

"First, let's figure out how long it took Jon to finish the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes)
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it took James for each part of the triathlon.

James's times:
- Swim: James is 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 10% less time.
  10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes.
  So, James's swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.
- Bike: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon.
  So, James's bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Let's call the time James took for the run \( R \).

Total time for James:
36 + 85 + \( R \) = 121 + \( R \)

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
121 + \( R \) = 170 + 10
121 + \( R \) = 180

Now, solve for \( R \):
\( R \) = 180 - 121
\( R \) = 59

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

"First, let's figure out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour.

30 minutes is half an hour, so the horse runs:
32 miles per hour * 0.5 hour = 16 miles

For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
16 miles * 1/2 bail of hay per mile = 8 bails of hay

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails will cost:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has:
6 * $5 = $30

If he spends $24 on hay, the change he will have is:
$30 - $24 = $6

"First, let's find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total. 

4 dozen eggs means 4 x 12 = 48 eggs.
She also has 2 more eggs from the cupboard.

So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"First, let's find out how many points Joey has after his turn. Joey starts with 214 points and scores 26 points. So, we add these together:

214 + 26 = 240

Now, let's find out how many points Marcy has after her turn. Marcy starts with 225 points and scores 10 points. So, we add these together:

225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning. We subtract Marcy's total points from Joey's total points:

240 - 235 = 5

So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

"First, let's find out how much the salesman paid for each sneaker. He bought 48 sneakers for $576, so we divide 576 by 48:
\[ 576 \div 48 = 12 \]
So, each sneaker cost him $12.

Next, let's calculate how much he made from the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]
So, he made $340 from the flash sale.

Now, let's find out how many sneakers he had left after the flash sale:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]
He sold these 31 sneakers to a department store for $25 each:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]
So, he made $775 from selling the rest of the sneakers.

Now, let's add the money he made from both sales:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]
So, he made a total of $1115 from selling all the sneakers.

Finally, to find his profit, we subtract the total cost from the total sales:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

The salesman's profit was $539.

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each have sixteen crayons:
4 packets ร 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the two totals together to find the total number of crayons:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

So, Beatrice bought 112 crayons in all.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes the movie, popcorn, and soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.
2. The regular movie ticket costs $12.
3. The soda costs $3.
4. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

If you didn't buy the super ticket, you paid $2 less than the super ticket price. So, the total cost without the super ticket is $21 - $2 = $19.

Now, let's find out the cost of the popcorn:
- The total cost without the super ticket is $19.
- The movie ticket costs $12.
- The soda costs $3.

So, the cost of the popcorn is $19 - $12 - $3 = $4.

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"First, let's find out how much it cost to fill one balloon before the price increase. If 20 balloons cost $900, we divide $900 by 20 to find the cost per balloon.

$900 รท 20 = $45

So, each balloon cost $45 before the price increase. After the price increase, each balloon cost $20 more. So, we add $20 to $45 to find the new cost per balloon.

$45 + $20 = $65

Now, if Bentley fills 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost per balloon by 170 to find the total cost.

$65 ร 170 = $11,050

So, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.

First, let's find the total distance:
- The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so it travels 60 * 2 = 120 miles.
- Then, the car drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so it travels 30 * 1 = 30 miles.
- The total distance is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

Next, let's find the total time:
- The car drives for 2 hours and then 1 hour, so the total time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the average speed:
- Average speed = total distance / total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

50 mph"
"First, let's figure out how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 away, so she has:

8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

Next, we need to find out how many rubies she got. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she now has 2 rubies.

Now, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Each sapphire is worth $800, so 5 sapphires are worth:

5 * 800 = $4000

Then, we calculate the value of the rubies. Each ruby is worth $1200, so 2 rubies are worth:

2 * 1200 = $2400

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we first need to figure out how many apples they eat each day together. 

Marin eats 4 apples a day.
Nancy eats 4 apples a day.

So, together they eat:
4 apples (Marin) + 4 apples (Nancy) = 8 apples a day.

Now, to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days, we multiply the number of apples they eat each day by the number of days:
8 apples/day ร 30 days = 240 apples.

"First, we need to find out how much soil Bob needs. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume of one raised bed, we multiply these numbers together:

2 feet (width) x 8 feet (length) x 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10:

32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:

320 cubic feet รท 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

160 bags x $12/bag = $1920

"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 60% more green cards than red cards, and there are 15 red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards like this:

60% of 15 red cards is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \) more green cards.

So, the total number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \) green cards.

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards:

\( 15 \) red cards + \( 24 \) green cards = \( 39 \) yellow cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards:

Next, let's find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer has 3 spotted puppies and Brandon has 4 spotted puppies. So, together they have:

3 + 4 = 7 spotted puppies

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100:

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

"First, let's find out how much all the feed weighs.

Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add all the weights together to find the total weight of the feed.

Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity.

4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

Since you can't make a fraction of a trip, if there's any remainder, the farmer will need to make an additional trip. In this case, there's no remainder, so the farmer needs exactly 2 trips.

- Each can is worth 2 cents.
- So, 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents from cans.

For the plastic bottles:
- She drinks 5 bottles a week.
- Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents from bottles.

Now, let's add the earnings from cans and bottles for one week:
- 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents in one week.

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, let's break it down step by step.

1. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats.
2. He also gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.
3. Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total.

Let's call the number of carrot sticks Matt eats ""C"".

The number of cookies Matt gets from the carrot sticks is \( \frac{C}{2} \).

Including the 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room, the total number of cookies Matt gets is \( \frac{C}{2} + 2 \).

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{C}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( C \):
1. Subtract 2 from both sides:

"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step.

1. We know that three-fourths (3/4) of the students have a desktop computer at home.
2. This means that one-fourth (1/4) of the students do not have a desktop computer at home.
3. We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This represents the one-fourth (1/4) of the total number of students.

To find the total number of students, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20 \]

To solve for the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 \]

- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

If we add the kids allergic to dairy and the kids allergic to peanuts, we get:
9 + 6 = 15

But this count includes the 3 kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice. So, we need to subtract these 3 kids once to avoid double-counting:
15 - 3 = 12

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one thing.

Now, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids in the class:
32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, 20 kids are not allergic to anything.

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees and the number of tour guides.

First, calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of 200 employees each.
- So, \(3 \times 200 = 600\) employees.

Next, calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- So, \(3 \times 7 = 21\) tour guides.

Now, add the number of employees and tour guides together:
- \(600 + 21 = 621\).

So, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the plane tickets. Since there are two people, and each ticket costs $5000, the total for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. The normal price is $1500 per day, and they are staying for 3 days, so the normal cost would be:
\[ 1500 \times 3 = 4500 \]

Since it's a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. To find the extra cost, we calculate 20% of $4500:
\[ 4500 \times 0.20 = 900 \]

So, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 4500 + 900 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

The total cost of the trip is:
15400"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so:
\[ \text{Jasper's blue paint} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so:
\[ \text{Jasper's yellow paint} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint Jasper has:
\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

So, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to figure out the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.

The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. So, the weight of the 2010 penny is:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to get the combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn, we first add up what they have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91.

$83 + $91 = $174

They needed to raise $200 in total. So, we subtract what they have earned from their goal to find out how much more they need.

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

"First, let's find out how many songs Luri has on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20 songs. So, Luri has:

3 * 20 = 60 songs

Now, let's see how many more songs each can add to their players. Both players can hold up to 100 songs.

Gabriel can add:
100 - 20 = 80 songs

Luri can add:
100 - 60 = 40 songs

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

80 - 40 = 40

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel can.

"To find out how much money Stetson gave up, we first need to figure out how many oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges in total. Stetson ate 2/5 of these oranges. 

To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \]
\[ 120 \div 5 = 24 \]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Since Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:
\[ 24 \times 10 = 240 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

"To find out how much Jillian's handbag cost, we first need to figure out what 3 times the cost of her shoes is, and then subtract $20 from that amount.

1. The cost of the shoes is $80.
2. Three times the cost of the shoes is \(3 \times 80 = 240\).
3. Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than this amount, so we subtract $20 from $240.

So, the cost of the handbag is \(240 - 20 = 220\).

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Uncle Ben has 4 horses.
2. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
3. Each horse is fed 2 times a day.
4. So, each horse eats 5 pounds x 2 meals = 10 pounds of oats per day.
5. For 4 horses, they eat 10 pounds x 4 horses = 40 pounds of oats per day.
6. Over 5 days, the horses will eat 40 pounds x 5 days = 200 pounds of oats.
7. Each bag of oats contains 50 pounds.
8. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total pounds of oats by the pounds per bag: 200 pounds รท 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"First, let's figure out how much Heather will pay for 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

1. The razors are on sale for buy one get one free. So, if Heather buys 1 pack, she gets another pack for free. This means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
2. The price of 1 pack is $4.00.
3. With the sale, 2 packs will cost her $4.00.
4. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's find out how much each razor costs. 

1. Each pack has 4 razors, so 2 packs have 4 * 2 = 8 razors.
2. The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
3. To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents: $0.25 = 25 cents.

- 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The total height is:
\[ 9 \times 64 + 60 \]

Let's do the multiplication and addition:
\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \]
\[ 576 + 60 = 636 \]

So, the total height of the pyramid in inches is 636 inches.

"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides over 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives in the morning twice a day for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives in the afternoon twice a day for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Now, let's add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = 84 + 28 = 112 dollars

So, Paul spent 112 dollars on driving his car during these two weeks.

"To find out how many guests are needed for the two venues to cost the same, we can set up an equation. Let's call the number of guests ""x"".

For the first venue:
- The cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 for each guest for food.
- So, the total cost is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per guest, which includes food.
- So, the total cost is $25x.

We want to find the number of guests (x) where the costs are the same, so we set the two costs equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for x:

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests needed for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say Bodhi found \( B \) insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.

Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

Together, they found 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) = 43 \]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]
\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we solve for \( B \):
\[ 2B = 43 - 7 \]
\[ 2B = 36 \]
\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects.

Now, let's find out how many insects David found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

David found 9 insects.

Finally, let's find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Lily found 16 insects.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips is:
10 trips * $2.20/trip = $22.00

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would only pay $20 for the week.

To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from what she would normally pay:

"To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we can add up the wool needed for each item and then multiply by the number of grandchildren, since she's making the same set of items for each of them.

- For a hat, she needs 2 skeins.
- For a scarf, she needs 4 skeins.
- For a sweater, she needs 12 skeins.
- For a pair of mittens, she needs 1 skein.
- For a pair of socks, she needs 2 skeins.

First, let's add up the wool needed for one set of winter wear:
2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins

Since she has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the total for one set by 3:
21 skeins/set ร 3 sets = 63 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, he has:
   100 - 12 = 88 problems left.
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. That means:
   3 * 12 = 36 problems.
   So, after Tuesday, he has:
   88 - 36 = 52 problems left.
4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. One-quarter of 52 is:
   52 / 4 = 13 problems.
   So, after Wednesday, he has:
   52 - 13 = 39 problems left.

Therefore, Chris has 39 problems left to complete on Thursday.

"Let's figure this out step by step:

1. Tony picks 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up how many quarts they all pick together in one hour:
- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts

"The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, which is a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold. Then, a grocery store returned 6 loaves, so they got 6 loaves back. To find out how many loaves they have left, we subtract the loaves sold from the total they started with and then add the returned loaves:

200 - 132 = 68 loaves left after sales.
68 + 6 = 74 loaves after adding the returned loaves.

"To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to figure out how many rows of red tulips and how many rows of blue tulips he can make.

First, let's look at the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in one row.
- To find out how many rows of red tulips he can plant, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row: 36 รท 6 = 6 rows.

Next, let's look at the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in one row.
- To find out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row: 24 รท 8 = 3 rows.

Now, we add the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Rows of red tulips: 6
- Rows of blue tulips: 3
- Total rows: 6 + 3 = 9

So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

"First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins Heather will use for the oatmeal cookies. Since she divides the 27 cups of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide 27 by 3:

27 รท 3 = 9 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies.

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins, so we divide 9 by 3/4:

9 รท (3/4) = 9 ร (4/3) = 36/3 = 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"First, let's figure out how much Ada pays for her electric bill before adding the new device.

Ada uses 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours/day = 288 kilowatts/day

Now, let's find out how much she pays per day:
288 kilowatts/day * $1.50/kilowatt = $432/day

For a week (7 days), her bill would be:
$432/day * 7 days = $3024

Now, let's add the new device. The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour, so:
2 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours/day = 48 kilowatts/day

The total daily consumption with the new device is:
288 kilowatts/day + 48 kilowatts/day = 336 kilowatts/day

The cost per day with the new device is:
336 kilowatts/day * $1.50/kilowatt = $504/day

For a week, the new bill would be:
$504/day * 7 days = $3528

Now, let's find the difference between the old and new weekly bills:
$3528 - $3024 = $504

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is $504.

"First, let's figure out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, we need to find out how many days it would take for 5 people to do the same job. Since 5 people can work together, they can do the job 5 times faster.

So, 10 days divided by 5 people is 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 2 days by 24 hours to find out how many hours it would take.

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.
5. Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs:
   - Ophelia's sofas: 20
   - Ophelia's chairs: 22
   - Jenna's sofas: 64
   - Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas and chairs: 20 + 22 + 64 + 66 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we first need to figure out how much the headphone set cost. 

1. We know Tom paid $48 in total.
2. He bought a CD for $4.
3. So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $44 left. 

4. Each CD costs $4.
5. To find out how many more CDs he could buy with $44, we divide $44 by $4.

$44 รท $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

"To find out how many hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to add up all the hours he worked out each week.

First, let's figure out how many hours he would have worked out if he stuck to his 4-hour plan every week:
4 hours/week * 8 weeks = 32 hours

Now, we need to account for the extra hours he worked out:
- For two weeks, he worked out 5 hours each week, which is 1 extra hour per week for those two weeks.
- For one week, he worked out 6 hours, which is 2 extra hours for that week.

So, the extra hours are:
1 extra hour/week * 2 weeks = 2 extra hours
2 extra hours for the one week = 2 extra hours

Total extra hours = 2 + 2 = 4 extra hours

Now, we add the extra hours to the original total:
32 hours + 4 extra hours = 36 hours

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is:

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers:** 48
2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off.

   - Number of people getting on: \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - Passengers after the first stop: \( 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \)

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off.
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on.
   - Number of people getting on: \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   - Passengers after the second stop: \( 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \)

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:

"First, let's figure out how old Jame is now. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, that means he is 27 - 5 = 22 years old now.

Next, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 30 * 2 = 60. 

Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

Now, to find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55, which gives 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Finally, to find out how many years separate their ages now, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age: 47 - 22 = 25.

"First, let's find out how much the printer cost. The printer was $400 less than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100. So, the printer cost:
\[ 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the 2 monitors is $2,400. We can write this as:
\[ 1100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Let's add the cost of the computer and the printer:
\[ 1100 + 700 = 1800 \]

So, the equation now is:
\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we need to subtract 1800 from 2400:
\[ 2400 - 1800 = 600 \]

This is the total cost for 2 monitors. To find the cost of one monitor, we divide by 2:
\[ 600 \div 2 = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ 300 \]

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add up the thickness of each book.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, we add the thickness of all four books together:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

- 15 vlogs in the third week

Let's add these together:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal of 72 vlogs:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"To figure out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, let's break it down step by step.

1. April has 30 days.
2. The first half of April is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.
3. Let's say Elvis saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half.
4. In the second half, he saves twice as much each day, so he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day.
5. The total savings for the first half of April is \( 15x \).
6. The total savings for the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).
7. The total savings for the month is \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).
8. Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so \( 45x = 1125 \).
9. To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45: \( x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \).

So, Elvis saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half, which is \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars.

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

Now, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. If Mark weighs 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, then:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, let's find out how much Bob weighs. If Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, then:

Bob's weight = 2 ร Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 ร 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, let's find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:

Average weight = Total weight รท 3
Average weight = 540 pounds รท 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees up every hour.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

So, the sun will move up by:
5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we add this to the initial angle of the pyramid:
32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun will be 82 degrees.

"First, we need to find out how old James's younger son is. Since the younger son is 4 years younger than the 12-year-old, we do:
12 - 4 = 8
So, the younger son is 8 years old.

Next, we need to figure out how many candles James needs in total. He needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son:
12 + 8 = 20
James needs 20 candles in total.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack has 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
20 รท 5 = 4
James needs to buy 4 packs of candles.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
4 ร 3 = 12
James spends $12 on candles.

"First, let's figure out how many minutes Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, so:
15 minutes/night ร 7 nights = 105 minutes

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. Since she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute:
2 pages รท 1.5 minutes = 1.333 pages/minute

Now, we can calculate how many pages she read in 105 minutes:
1.333 pages/minute ร 105 minutes = 140 pages

In the second week, she read 100 pages. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages

"To find out how old Shiloh's nephew is today, we can set up a simple equation. 

First, let's figure out how old Shiloh will be in 7 years:
Shiloh is 44 years old today, so in 7 years, he will be:
44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Now, we know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's call the nephew's age today ""N"". In 7 years, the nephew will be N + 7 years old.

So, we can write the equation:
51 = 3 * (N + 7)

Now, we solve for N:
51 = 3 * (N + 7)
51 = 3N + 21
51 - 21 = 3N
30 = 3N
N = 30 / 3
N = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"First, let's figure out how much money Peter spends each day. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for 7 days. So, we divide $70 by 7:

$70 รท 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so he can buy:

$10 รท $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day

Since he buys these for 4 days, the total number of wooden action figures he buys is:

2 wooden action figures/day ร 4 days = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week, from Thursday to Saturday, he spends $10 each day on plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy:

$10 รท $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day

Since he buys these for 3 days, the total number of plastic action figures he buys is:

5 plastic action figures/day ร 3 days = 15 plastic action figures

Now, we add the total number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures he has by the end of the week:

8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account.
2. She takes out $100 every month.
3. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.
4. If she takes out $100 each month for 24 months, she will take out a total of 24 x $100 = $2400.
5. To find out how much money is left, we subtract the total amount taken out from the starting amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account.

"First, we need to find out by what percentage the oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it actually reaches 468 degrees. 

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 4\% \]

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( x \) be the set temperature. The actual temperature is 4% more than the set temperature, so:
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = x + 0.04x \]
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.04:
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees.

3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans, so it is \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Now, solve for \( B \):

Each gumball costs 5 cents, so we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents รท 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find out how many legs all the pets in the store have, we need to think about how many legs each type of animal has and then add them all up.

Dogs have 4 legs each. Since there are 5 dogs, we do:
5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs

Cats also have 4 legs each. Since there are 2 cats, we do:
2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs

Birds have 2 legs each. Since there are 10 birds, we do:
10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Now, we add all the legs together:
20 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from cats) + 20 legs (from birds) = 48 legs

"First, we need to find out what 50% more than 8 pounds is. 

50% of 8 pounds is 4 pounds (because 8 divided by 2 is 4).

So, if Jamaal increases the weight by 50%, he uses 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds.

But 12 pounds is too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter.

12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

So, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Birthday Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.

2. **First Year:**
   - He buys 1 game per month for 12 months.
   - 1 game/month * 12 months = 12 games
   - He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
   - Total for the first year: 12 + 5 = 17 games

3. **Second Year:**
   - He buys 2 games per month for 12 months.
   - 2 games/month * 12 months = 24 games
   - He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
   - Total for the second year: 24 + 5 = 29 games

4. **Third Year:**
   - He buys 4 games per month for 12 months.
   - 4 games/month * 12 months = 48 games
   - He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
   - Total for the third year: 48 + 5 = 53 games

5. **Total Games After 3 Years:**
   - Birthday games: 5

"First, we need to find out how fast the plane is going. We do this by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took. So, 1200 miles divided by 3 hours equals 400 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to travel 2000 miles at this speed. We do this by dividing the distance by the speed. So, 2000 miles divided by 400 miles per hour equals 5 hours.

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 more miles.

"First, let's figure out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, let's find out how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz makes in two hours. So, we calculate 3/4 of 120 pounds:

3/4 * 120 pounds = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we know how many pounds each can make in one hour:
- Ruiz: 60 pounds per hour
- Marissa: 90 pounds per hour

If they both work for 12 hours in a day, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates they make:
- Ruiz in 12 hours: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
- Marissa in 12 hours: 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

Adding both amounts together gives us the total:
720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

"Let's figure this out step by step.

On Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. So, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday. So, he spends:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

If Howard originally had $100, the amount of money he has left after spending $88 is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Howard has 12 dollars left.

"First, let's figure out how much money Patrick made in the first four hours. He sold 15 cups of lemonade each hour for $0.50 per cup. So, in one hour, he made:

15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50

Since he did this for four hours, we multiply $7.50 by 4:

$7.50 * 4 = $30.00

Next, let's calculate how much he made in the last two hours. He sold 10 cups of lemonade each hour for $0.60 per cup. So, in one hour, he made:

10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00

Since he did this for two hours, we multiply $6.00 by 2:

$6.00 * 2 = $12.00

Now, we add the money he made in the first four hours to the money he made in the last two hours to find the total:

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Patrick earned $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"First, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate in 400 miles. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations for 400 miles by:

\[ 725 \text{ rotations} \times \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 725 \times 200 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations a tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations/month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Finally, we convert the number of months into years:

\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

"If the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and gives 120 washings with 2 pumps per wash, then it means there are 240 pumps in the bottle (because 120 washings times 2 pumps each equals 240 pumps).

If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the total cost of the bottle divided by the number of pumps in the bottle. So, $24.00 divided by 240 pumps.

$24.00 is the same as 2400 cents. So, 2400 cents divided by 240 pumps equals 10 cents per pump.

"First, let's find out how much the shirt and shorts cost after the 30% discount.

The shirt costs $25. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the price. So, the shirt will cost:
$25 ร 0.70 = $17.50

The shorts cost $35. With the 30% discount, Joe pays 70% of the price. So, the shorts will cost:
$35 ร 0.70 = $24.50

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost:
$17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the shirt and shorts, he will have:
$50 - $42.00 = $8.00

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. First, figure out how much butter is needed for 4 dozen croissants.
   - Since 1 dozen croissants need 1/4 pound of butter, 4 dozen will need 4 times that amount.
   - 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound of butter for 4 dozen croissants.

2. Next, calculate how much butter is needed for a week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - If he makes 4 dozen croissants each day, he will need 1 pound of butter each day.
   - So, for 7 days, he will need 7 * 1 = 7 pounds of butter.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make croissants for a week.

"First, we need to find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street. We do this by multiplying the cost per meter by the length of Monica's street:
$194 per meter ร 150 meters = $29,100

Next, we find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street by multiplying the cost per meter by the length of Lewis' street:
$194 per meter ร 490 meters = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:
$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street.

"First, let's figure out how long the research took in total. John's research took 10 times the initial 5 months, so that's 50 months in total. The first 5 months were funded at $100,000, so that's $20,000 per month for those months.

For the remaining 45 months, each month cost 50% more than the initial $20,000. So, each of these months cost $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- For the first 5 months: 5 months * $20,000/month = $100,000
- For the next 45 months: 45 months * $30,000/month = $1,350,000

Adding these together gives the total cost:

"To find out how many ounces of meat the team ate, we need to add up the meat from each player who ate meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ate vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, we add up all the meat:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the team ate 30 ounces of meat in total.

"First, let's figure out how many loads of laundry Gary does in a week. Since he does laundry twice a week, that means he does 2 loads each week.

Next, we need to find out how many loads he does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads:
104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Now, we need to find out how much 2080 gallons of water cost. Since a gallon of water costs $0.15:
2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, figure out how much meat Prince sells in one day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, we multiply 15 kg by 10 hours.
   15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

2. Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day.
   750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

1/4 * 72 seats = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats were left.

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.

1/3 * 54 seats = 18 seats

James sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000. So, the total sales amount is:
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car. So, the cost to acquire one car is:

The total cost to acquire 10 cars is:
10 cars * $7,500 = $75,000

Now, let's find out the profit. The profit is the total sales minus the total cost to acquire the cars:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:

60% of 25 = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

Price of gold jewel = $1600

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel. So, we can calculate it like this:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels to find the total price:

"To figure out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to find out how much each class costs if he misses some. If Manny misses a class, the cost per class goes up because the $60 is spread over fewer classes.

First, let's see what the cost per class is if he goes to all 10 classes:
$60 รท 10 classes = $6 per class

This is less than $10, so it's okay. Now, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class goes over $10.

If he misses 1 class, he goes to 9 classes:
$60 รท 9 classes = about $6.67 per class

If he misses 2 classes, he goes to 8 classes:
$60 รท 8 classes = $7.50 per class

If he misses 3 classes, he goes to 7 classes:
$60 รท 7 classes = about $8.57 per class

If he misses 4 classes, he goes to 6 classes:
$60 รท 6 classes = $10 per class

If he misses 5 classes, he goes to 5 classes:
$60 รท 5 classes = $12 per class

At 5 missed classes, the cost per class is $12, which is more than $10. So, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class goes over $10.

"First, we need to find out how many cubic feet of earth Bob needs to dig. We do this by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the hole.

Length = 6 feet
Width = 4 feet
Depth = 3 feet

Volume = Length ร Width ร Depth
Volume = 6 ร 4 ร 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth, we can find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet by multiplying the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume ร Time per cubic foot
Time = 72 ร 3
Time = 216 seconds

To make it easier to understand, we can convert the time into minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:

Time in minutes = 216 รท 60
Time in minutes = 3.6 minutes

But since the question asks for the time in seconds, the final answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price and the cost of all the extra features.

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   - \( \frac{7500}{3} = 2500 \)
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   - \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \)
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together:

- Base price: $30,000
- King cab: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Total cost:
\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

"First, let's figure out Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.

Tim's original salary is $20,000 a month. A 5% raise means he gets an extra 5% of $20,000.

5% of $20,000 is:
\[ 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

Next, let's calculate his bonus, which is half a month's salary. Since his new monthly salary is $21,000, his bonus is:
\[ 21,000 \div 2 = 10,500 \]

Now, let's find out how much he makes in a year. He earns $21,000 each month, and there are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 21,000 \times 12 = 252,000 \]

Adding the bonus to his yearly salary:
\[ 252,000 + 10,500 = 262,500 \]

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the dress pants. Since the dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we do:
$750 / 5 = $150 per pair of dress pants.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the suits:
10 suits * $750 per suit = $7500.

Next, the total cost for the dress pants:
10 pairs * $150 per pair = $1500.

For the dress shirts, James buys 3 shirts for each of the 10 suits, so:
10 suits * 3 shirts per suit = 30 shirts.

The total cost for the dress shirts is:
30 shirts * $60 per shirt = $1800.

Now, we add up all the costs:
$7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800.

So, the total cost for everything is:
$10800."
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of articles published by the news website in February.
2. Calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company in February.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is currently half as old as his mom. So, the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. So, the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total, we first need to figure out how much flour was in one bag. Since one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

This means one bag contains 16 kilograms of flour. Now, to find out how much flour was in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
Alisa's speed = 12 miles per hour
Alisa's time = 4.5 hours
Distance = Speed ร Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour ร 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
Stanley's speed = 10 miles per hour
Stanley's time = 2.5 hours
Distance = Speed ร Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour ร 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

"First, let's figure out how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet in one hour, so for 24 feet of soil, it will take him:

24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours

Next, let's figure out how long it takes him to dig through the clay. He digs half as fast through clay, so that's 2 feet per hour. For 8 feet of clay, it will take him:

8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours

Now, we add the time for soil and clay together:

6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To find out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to count everyone who will get cupcakes and then multiply by 2 because he's getting 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate) for each person.

First, let's count the total number of people:
- Howie: 1
- His teacher: 1
- His classmates: 25

So, the total number of people is:
1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people

Since Howie wants to get 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the number of people by 2:
27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"First, let's figure out how much Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the total cost before the voucher is:
20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400

She had a voucher for $2 off, so the final cost for Clara is:
$400 - $2 = $398

Next, let's calculate how much Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30. So, the total cost before the discount is:
20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the discount amount is:
10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60

The final cost for Sheila after the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
$540 - $398 = $142

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.

"First, let's find out how much Ariadne made from selling green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half of what she made from green hats. So, the sales from green hats were:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to find out the sales for the second month. The sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

Finally, to find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from both months:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

4. Each hour after the first paid hour costs twice as much as the previous hour.

So, let's calculate the cost for each hour:
- First paid hour: $15
- Second paid hour: $15 * 2 = $30
- Third paid hour: $30 * 2 = $60

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest ร 16 guests = 48 halves.

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - To find out how many whole eggs are needed for 48 halves:
   - Number of whole eggs = 48 halves รท 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs.

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - Number of dozens = 24 eggs รท 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

"To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate how many days it will take him to read the whole book.

Mike plans to read 10 pages a day, and the book has 200 pages. So, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day:

200 pages รท 10 pages/day = 20 days

This means it will take Mike 20 days to finish the book. Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we subtract the number of days it takes Mike to read the book from the total number of days he has:

30 days - 20 days = 10 days

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To solve this, let's think about it step by step.

1. Each animal has one head.
2. Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2 legs.
3. We know there are 20 animals in total (because there are 20 heads).
4. We also know there are 70 legs in total.

Let's use S for the number of sheep and G for the number of geese.

From the heads, we have:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

From the legs, we have:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to find S:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"First, let's find out the total weight of the 8 other adults. If one adult weighs 80 kg, then 8 adults would weigh:

8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Now, we need to add Jack's weight to this. Since we don't know Jack's exact weight, we'll assume he also weighs the average adult weight of 80 kg. So, the total weight with Jack would be:

640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg

The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg. To find out by how much they have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To find out how long the dress was in its original design, we need to work backwards from the final length. The final length of the dress is 140 cm, which includes the 20 cm lace trim and the 50% extension of the original length.

First, let's subtract the 20 cm lace trim from the final length:
140 cm - 20 cm = 120 cm

This 120 cm is the length of the dress after it was extended by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length of the dress \( x \). The extended length is \( x + 0.5x \), which is the same as \( 1.5x \).

So, we have:
1.5x = 120 cm

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 120 cm / 1.5
x = 80 cm

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

80 cm"
"To solve this, we need to figure out how long it takes Chris to mow half of his lawn in each mode.

1. In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the whole lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, to mow half the lawn, it would take him 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.
2. In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the whole lawn in 40 minutes. So, to mow half the lawn, it would take him 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took for each half:
30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn today.

"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to add up the time they have already spent walking and then subtract that from the total time they have.

First, they spend 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is. Then, they spend another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time spent so far is:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. So, the time they have left is:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

Now, let's find out the total number of cookies they baked together:

Total cookies = Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies
Total cookies = 30 + 60
Total cookies = 90

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we need to subtract those from the total:

"Let's think about this step by step. We have two sets of siblings: one set of twins and one set of triplets. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. We also know that the combined ages of all the siblings add up to 44.

Let's use some simple math to figure this out:

1. Let's say the age of one triplet is \( T \).
2. Then the age of one twin is \( T + 7 \) because the twin is 7 years older.
3. Since there are two twins, their total age is \( 2 \times (T + 7) \).
4. Since there are three triplets, their total age is \( 3 \times T \).

The combined ages of all the siblings is 44, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2 \times (T + 7) + 3 \times T = 44 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Expand the equation:
\[ 2T + 14 + 3T = 44 \]

2. Combine like terms:
\[ 5T + 14 = 44 \]

3. Subtract 14 from both sides:
\[ 5T = 30 \]

4. Divide both sides by 5:
\[ T = 6 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 6 years. Now, we need to find the age of one twin:
\[ T + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Let's convert that to minutes:
3 hours = 3 ร 60 = 180 minutes

Now, let's subtract the time he needs for homework from the total time before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"First, let's find out how much the candies cost. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so five lollipops cost:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

So, the four candies cost $1.20. To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now we know the cost of one lollipop is $0.40 and the cost of one candy is $0.30. To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we calculate:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives us the total cost:

$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

"First, let's figure out how many coins Neil saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so we need to find out what 2/5 of 20 is and then add that to 20.

2/5 of 20 is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \] coins every month.

Now, let's calculate how many coins each of them saves in ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \] months.

Rong's total savings in ten years:
\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \] coins.

Neil's total savings in ten years:
\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \] coins.

Together, they have:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \] coins.

"First, let's find out how much the vaccines cost. Each vaccine is $20, and John's dog needs 2 vaccines, so:
2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Now, let's say the total bill is T. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
Heartworm check = 0.60 * T

The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check:
T = $40 + 0.60 * T

To find T, we need to solve this equation. First, we move 0.60 * T to the other side:
T - 0.60 * T = $40

This simplifies to:
0.40 * T = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.40 to find T:
T = $40 / 0.40
T = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

1. **Bananas**: Each banana costs twice as much as an apple. Since an apple costs $0.5, a banana costs:
   \[
   2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]
   There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is:
   \[
   5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apples**: Each apple costs $0.5. There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Oranges**: Each orange costs three times as much as a banana. Since a banana costs $1, an orange costs:
   \[
   3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is:
   \[

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, we add 4 to the number of red squares:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ blue squares}
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we add 6 to the number of blue squares:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24 \text{ green squares}
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, we subtract 12 from the number of green squares:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12 \text{ white squares}

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \text{ squares}

"First, we need to find out how much more each computer costs because of the 10% increase. If the original price was $700, we can find 10% of $700 by multiplying 700 by 0.10.

700 * 0.10 = 70

So, each computer is now $70 more expensive. We add this to the original price to get the new price of each computer.

700 + 70 = 770

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. We do this by multiplying 770 by 500.

770 * 500 = 385000

"To find out how many calories are in John's omelet, we need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs:
- Each egg has 75 calories.
- John uses 6 eggs.
- So, the total calories from the eggs are 75 calories/egg * 6 eggs = 450 calories.

Next, the calories from the cheese:
- Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- So, the total calories from the cheese are 120 calories/ounce * 2 ounces = 240 calories.

Then, the calories from the ham:
- Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
- John uses 2 ounces of ham.
- So, the total calories from the ham are 40 calories/ounce * 2 ounces = 80 calories.

Now, we add all the calories together:
- Calories from eggs: 450
- Calories from cheese: 240
- Calories from ham: 80

Total calories = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770

"To find out how many times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to break down the problem into two parts: when her arms are at her sides and when her arms are raised.

1. **When her arms are at her sides:**
   - She dances for 3 minutes (since she dances for a total of 5 minutes and her arms are raised for 2 minutes).
   - Right foot: 300 taps per minute.
   - Left foot: 250 taps per minute.
   - Total taps per minute for both feet: 300 + 250 = 550 taps.
   - Total taps for 3 minutes: 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

2. **When her arms are raised:**
   - She dances for 2 minutes.
   - Both feet: 200 taps per minute each.
   - Total taps per minute for both feet: 200 + 200 = 400 taps.
   - Total taps for 2 minutes: 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

3. **Total taps for the entire 5 minutes:**
   - Total taps when arms are at her sides: 1650 taps.
   - Total taps when arms are raised: 800 taps.
   - Combined total taps: 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the cost of the damage to his car if he doesn't fix it with the total cost if he does fix it.

1. The cost of the damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed: $450
2. The cost if Ron fixes the pothole:
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75
   - Total cost for fixing the pothole: $120 + $75 = $195

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of the damage to find out how much he saves:
$450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many slices each person ate.

Bryce and two friends each ate 2/3 of their pizzas:
- Each pizza has 12 slices.
- 2/3 of 12 slices is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) slices.
- So, each of these three people ate 8 slices.

The two remaining friends each ate 3/4 of their pizzas:
- 3/4 of 12 slices is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \) slices.
- So, each of these two people ate 9 slices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten:
- Bryce and two friends ate \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) slices.
- The two remaining friends ate \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) slices.
- Total slices eaten is \( 24 + 18 = 42 \) slices.

Next, we need to find out how many slices were left:
- Each of the five pizzas had 12 slices, so the total number of slices is \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) slices.
- The number of slices left is \( 60 - 42 = 18 \) slices.

So, the number of slices left is:

"First, let's figure out how long the dog takes to eat nine sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes, and the dog takes 2/3 of that time.

2/3 of 30 minutes is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. We add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2.

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's figure out how long Topher's shoe is in inches. We know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 8 feet is 8 times 12 inches, which is 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Now, we know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe \( x \) inches. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 9x + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 9x = 90 \]

Then, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"First, let's figure out how many windows are in the students' cars and the teachers' cars.

For the students' cars:
- There are 64 cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Now, let's find out how many windows Hannah smashes.

For the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is 256 windows / 4 = 64 windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- She smashes 3/4ths of the windows.
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is 64 windows * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- 64 windows (students) + 48 windows (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To find out what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we first need to find the total number of spools and then the total number of blue spools.

The total number of spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools

The total number of blue spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

2. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. So, we need to find out how many people that is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \text{ people}
   \]
   This means 2000 people had voted by midday.

3. The number of people who had not voted by midday is:
   \[

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, each pack has 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces in each pack:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

6 adults * 1 smore/adult = 6 smores

Now, add the smores for kids and adults together:
18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, so we need to find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

"First, let's find out how old Dora's father is. If Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice her age, we can calculate it like this:

Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Dora's father's age = 30 + 8
Dora's father's age = 38

Now, let's find out how old Dora's mother is. If Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, we can calculate it like this:

Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4
Dora's mother's age = 34

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34

"First, let's figure out how much water Peter uses for each type of ice cube.

For the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- So, 3 giant cubes use 3 * 4 = 12 ounces of water.

For the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- So, 7 medium cubes use 7 * 2 = 14 ounces of water.

For the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- So, 8 small cubes use 8 * 1/2 = 4 ounces of water.

- 10 glasses were broken, so the number of glasses left is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.
- 6 plates were broken, so the number of plates left is 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

Now, let's add the glasses and plates that are left to find the total.

"First, let's figure out how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

30 small stickers * 90% = 27 small stickers

Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets:

27 small stickers / 3 small stickers per large button = 9 large buttons

Next, let's see how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

40 large stickers * 50% = 20 large stickers

Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets:

20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

Now, she has 20 large stickers left, and she trades all of them for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so:

20 large stickers * 3 small buttons per large sticker = 60 small buttons

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from the small stickers and 20 large buttons from the large stickers, which totals:

9 large buttons + 20 large buttons = 29 large buttons

She also has 60 small buttons from the remaining large stickers. 

So, the total number of buttons she has by the end is:

29 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 89 buttons

"Let's think about this step by step. If the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against, we can set up a simple equation. Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is \( x \). Then the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we have:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Extra-small shirts**: Krissa needs 11 shirts.
2. **Small shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, 11 * 2 = 22 shirts.
3. **Medium shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, 22 - 4 = 18 shirts.
4. **Large shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, 18 / 2 = 9 shirts.
5. **Extra-large shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, 9 + 6 = 15 shirts.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

So, Krissa ordered 75 shirts in total.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of cases the second house needs is \( x \).
2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, so it will need \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
3. The third house needs double what the first house needs, so it will need \( 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x \) cases.

Now, we know the total number of cases for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + x + x = 250
\]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250
\]

To make it easier, multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

\[
x + 4x = 500

Combine like terms:

\[
5x = 500

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's figure out how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 miles per hour. 

To find the time, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:
\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives back the same distance at the same speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours.

Now, let's add up all the time:
- Time to drive to the museum: 2 hours
- Time spent at the museum: 6 hours
- Time to drive back: 2 hours

Total time gone from home:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

For the motorcycles:
- Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels.
- Henry has 73 motorcycles.
- So, the total number of wheels for the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles together:
- Total wheels needed = 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box:

"To find out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot was, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, and then add these distances together.

First, let's find out how fast they hiked. They hiked at a speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at 50 miles per hour, half of that is 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed was:
25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so the distance they hiked is:
1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's find out how long they drove. They spent a total of 6 hours traveling, and 1.5 hours of that was hiking, so they drove for:
6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours.

The distance they drove is the time they drove multiplied by their driving speed:

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Bob originally had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
3. After adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's call the number of orange fish Bob bought \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought \( W \).

So, the total number of orange fish Bob has now is \( 3 + O \), and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W) \]
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O = 8 + 2W - 3 \]
\[ O = 5 + 2W \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we can substitute \( O \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 5 + 2W + W = 17 \]
\[ 5 + 3W = 17 \]
\[ 3W = 17 - 5 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to work and back home each day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of workdays in a week to get the total weekly distance.
3. Determine how many gallons of gas Andy uses per week by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency.
4. Calculate the total cost of the gas used per week by multiplying the gallons of gas used per week by the price per gallon.

Let's do the math:

1. One-way distance to work is 5 miles, so round trip (to work and back home) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
2. Andy works 5 days a week, so the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.
3. Andy's car uses 1 gallon of gas for every 10 miles, so for 50 miles, he uses 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons.
4. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost for the gas used per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The train starts with 172 people.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
   172 - 47 = 125 people.
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
   125 + 13 = 138 people.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
   138 - 38 = 100 people.

So, the number of people on the train is 100.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30 day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, figure out how many bottle caps Damien finds in a month. Since he finds 10 bottle caps a day, we multiply 10 by 30 (the number of days in the month).
   10 bottle caps/day ร 30 days = 300 bottle caps

2. Next, we need to find out how much money 300 bottle caps are worth. Since each bottle cap is worth $0.25, we multiply 300 by $0.25.
   300 bottle caps ร $0.25/bottle cap = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30 day month.

"First, let's figure out how much Jamie earns for her regular 8 hours of work. She earns $20 per hour, so for 8 hours, she earns:

\[ 20 \times 8 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much she earns for the extra hours. She worked 11 hours in total, so the extra hours are:

\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

For these extra hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. First, we find 150% of $20:

\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

So, for the 3 extra hours, she earns:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money she earned for the regular hours and the extra hours to find her total earnings for the day:

\[ 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid 250 dollars for her work that day.

"To find out how many lions are in the enclosure, we need to add up the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

The zookeeper counted 12 female lions. 

There are half as many male lions as female lions, so:
12 / 2 = 6 male lions.

There are also 14 lion cubs.

Now, we add them all together:
12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32 lions.

"First, we need to find out how much 25% off is from the original price of $40. 

25% of $40 is calculated like this:
25/100 * 40 = 10

So, the discount is $10. Now we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
40 - 10 = 30

The sale price of the jeans is $30. Now, if Mike pays with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much change he will get back:
50 - 30 = 20

So, Mike will have $20 left over.

"First, let's figure out how many employees the company will have after three months. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees each month.

After 1 month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
After 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
After 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, to find out how much the company pays in total after three months, we need to multiply the number of employees by the salary and then by the number of months.

Total payment = Number of employees after 3 months ร Salary per employee ร Number of months
Total payment = 260 ร $4000 ร 3

Now, let's do the multiplication:
260 ร $4000 = $1,040,000 (this is the monthly payment for 260 employees)
$1,040,000 ร 3 = $3,120,000

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000.

"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to add up the time for all the songs they plan to sing. 

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"" twice:
150 seconds (for one song) ร 2 = 300 seconds

Next, we add the time for ""Jingle Bells,"" which they will sing once:
240 seconds

Now, we add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"" together:
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

So, the total time the choir will be caroling is 540 seconds.

"First, let's figure out Billy's current hourly wage. 

Billy started at $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50, so his wage became:
$10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00, so his wage became:
$10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's find out Sally's hourly wage. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary of $10, so:
$10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, if both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, we can calculate their earnings.

Billy's earnings for 20 hours:
$11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
$10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings:
$230 - $210 = $20.

"To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many students there are in total:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
So, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\) students.

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's find out how many teachers there are in total:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
So, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) teachers.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\) trees.

Now, we add the trees planted by the students and the teachers together:
- Trees planted by students: 1000
- Trees planted by teachers: 240
Total trees planted: \(1000 + 240 = 1240\)

"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles has now.

She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Now, let's say Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals she will have is \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply 0.30 by \( 14 + x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we need to isolate \( x \). Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's figure out how many days are in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day for 14 days, that's 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Next, for the week where she plays 2 hours every day, that's 7 days * 2 hours = 14 hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Kris wants to play a total of 30 hours, so we need to find out how many more hours she needs to play: 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The first car is going at 60 miles per hour, and the second car is going at 70 miles per hour. 

In 2 hours, the first car will have traveled:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

In the same 2 hours, the second car will have traveled:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

To find out how many miles separate them after 2 hours, we subtract the distance the first car traveled from the distance the second car traveled:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

"First, we need to find out how much the ring costs before the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, we add these together:

$600 + $300 = $900

Now, James pays a 30% premium on top of this cost. To find the premium, we calculate 30% of $900:

30% of $900 = 0.30 ร $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the original cost to find the total amount James paid:

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

   - Passed: 340
   - Total: 500

2. **Fourth-graders:**
   - Passed: 40
   - Total: 100

3. **Fifth-graders:**
   - The pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders.
   - Pass rate for fourth-graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%
   - Pass rate for fifth-graders: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \)

\[ 12 \text{ chips per square inch} \]

Now, let's find out how many square inches Milo can make with 144 chips:
\[ 144 \div 12 = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how long it can be, we divide the total area by the height:

"First, let's figure out how much tea the students drank in total.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:

Now, let's add the tea that was left over:
10 quarts (left over) + 6 quarts (drunk by 4 students) + 32 quarts (drunk by 16 students) = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

Let's see how many he needs to sell now:
- He sold 150 candies.
- He had 100 initially and then ordered 100 more, so he has 200 candies now.

To find out how many more he needs to sell to sell all his candies:

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many students are on campus at the end of May and then subtract the initial number of students (10) to find out how many additional students joined.

1. At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.
2. At the end of January, the number of students doubles: 10 * 2 = 20 students.
3. At the end of February, the number of students doubles again: 20 * 2 = 40 students.
4. At the end of March, the number of students doubles again: 40 * 2 = 80 students.
5. At the end of April, the number of students doubles again: 80 * 2 = 160 students.
6. At the end of May, the number of students doubles again: 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, we need to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May. We do this by subtracting the initial number of students (10) from the number of students at the end of May (320).

320 - 10 = 310

So, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310.

Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
5 flowers * 4 petals = 20 petals

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
6 flowers * 7 petals = 42 petals

Now, let's add all the petals together:
15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals + 42 petals = 101 petals

But, she drops 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract the petals from those flowers:
1 flower * 5 petals = 5 petals
1 flower * 6 petals = 6 petals
1 flower * 4 petals = 4 petals
1 flower * 7 petals = 7 petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:
5 petals + 6 petals + 4 petals + 7 petals = 22 petals

Now, subtract the petals from the dropped flowers from the total:
101 petals - 22 petals = 79 petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"First, let's figure out how long each person can play with one quarter.

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter.

Now, let's convert the total playtime from hours to minutes:
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Next, we calculate how many quarters each person uses:
- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Friend 1: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters
- Friend 2: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters
- Friend 3: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, let's add up all the quarters used:
12 (Jack) + 24 (Friend 1) + 24 (Friend 2) + 8 (Friend 3) = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total cost is:

"To solve this, let's use some simple math. We know Tanya makes a 10-ounce jar of salt scrub. Let's use letters to represent the amounts of each ingredient:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can write an equation for the total amount of the ingredients:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), we can substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \):

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]

Divide both sides by 10:

\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we know \( z = 1 \) ounce. Since \( s = 2z \):

\[ s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \] ounces

The amount of oil is \( 2s \):

\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \] ounces

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- So, the total cost for the cows is 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together:

First, let's say PJ has \( x \) cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

Now, we know the total number of cards is 341. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
- The shipping cost for the distance is 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60.
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund Milly will get from Amazon:
- The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
- The refund amount is $32 * 75% = $32 * 0.75 = $24.

Now, let's find out how much money Milly will lose:
- The amount Milly paid for the book is $32.
- The amount she will get refunded is $24.
- The shipping cost is $3.00.
- The total amount Milly will lose is $32 - $24 + $3.00 = $11.00.

"First, let's find out how much money Mulan has after her father gave her $100.

Mulan originally has $40.
Her father gave her $100.
So, $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, let's calculate how much she spent.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.
So, $60 + $20 = $80 spent in total.

Now, let's find out how much money she has left.

She had $140 and spent $80.
So, $140 - $80 = $60.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.
2. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so that's 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
3. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so that's 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up what he has produced in the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.

Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, so the amount he needs to produce in the fourth week is:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to add up all the time she spends on different activities related to TikTok.

First, let's calculate the time she spends recording videos:
- Each video is 4 minutes long.
- She records 18 videos each week.
- So, the time spent recording videos each week is \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.

Next, let's convert the weekly recording time into hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, \( 72 \) minutes is \( \frac{72}{60} = 1.2 \) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent recording videos in a month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the total time spent recording videos in a month is \( 1.2 \times 4 = 4.8 \) hours.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends writing songs:
- She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
- So, the total time spent writing songs in a month is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) hours.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends doing her makeup:
- She spends 15 minutes six days a week.
- So, the total time spent doing makeup each week is \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes.

Next, let's convert the weekly makeup time into hours:
- So, \( 90 \) minutes is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent doing makeup in a month:
- So, the total time spent doing makeup in a month is \( 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \) hours.

Finally, let's add up all the time spent on TikTok activities in a month:
- Time spent recording videos: 4.8 hours
- Time spent writing songs: 8 hours
- Time spent doing makeup: 6 hours

Total time spent on TikTok in a month:
\( 4.8 + 8 + 6 = 18.8 \) hours

"First, let's figure out how many extra items Angela has compared to what the basic installation includes.

The basic installation includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves (Angela doesn't need these)
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 extra mirrors)
- 2 chandeliers (1 extra chandelier)
- 20 pictures (10 extra pictures)

So, the total extra items are:
- 2 extra mirrors
- 1 extra chandelier
- 10 extra pictures

That's 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 extra items.

Each extra item costs $15.00, so the cost for the extra items is:
13 extra items * $15.00 per item = $195.00

The basic installation costs $129.00, so the total cost is:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

"First, let's find out how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we add $10.00 to $20.00.

$20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

So, Anthony has $30.00.

Now, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate 40% of $30.00.

40% of $30.00 = 0.40 ร $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has.

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

Now, we need to convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

480 inches / 12 inches per foot = 40 feet

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Mason rides his bike at 8 miles per hour. First, he rides for 4 hours. To find out how many miles he traveled in those 4 hours, we multiply his speed by the time:

8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

After resting, he rides for another 6 hours. We do the same calculation for this part of his trip:

8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

To find the total distance he traveled, we add the two distances together:

32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"First, let's figure out how long it takes one kangaroo to travel across the highway. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, then one kangaroo would take 3 times as long because the same distance is being covered by fewer animals. So, one kangaroo would take 18 hours * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, if a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take a turtle twice as long as a kangaroo to travel the same distance. So, one turtle would take 54 hours * 2 = 108 hours.

If we have four turtles, they would take the same amount of time as one turtle to travel the distance because they are all traveling at the same speed and the question is about the time it takes to cover the distance, not how many turtles are traveling. So, four turtles will also take 108 hours.

2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes

Now, we add up all the dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. The laptop costs $600.
2. Erika gets a $200 discount for trading in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

So, the total amount of money Erika has from her job and her mom is $150 + $80 = $230.

The total amount she needs to have to buy the laptop is $400 - $50 (the amount she still needs) = $350.

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

"First, let's figure out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and he slices 3 large apples, that's 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices from the large apples.

Next, let's find out how many slices he gets from the small apples. A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and he slices 5 small apples, so that's 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices from the small apples.

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples together to find the total number of slices. That's 15 slices from the large apples + 15 slices from the small apples = 30 slices in total.

Adam eats 15 slices, so to find out how many are left, we subtract the slices he eats from the total number of slices. That's 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices left.

500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the number of burritos Mr. George ordered:

600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

So, the total number of leftover burritos is 80.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so:
   - Green cars = 12 - 2 = 10
3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so:
   - Blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30
4. The total number of cars is 75. We need to find out how many yellow cars there are. First, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
   - Red cars + Green cars + Blue cars = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
5. Now, subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars:
   - Yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23

So, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know that together they have 85 books:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Let's add these up:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Now, we solve for \( F \):
\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"First, we find out how much the bag of sweet potatoes weighed. Since it weighed 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes, and the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weighed:
5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds

Next, we find out how much the bag of carrots weighed. It weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so:
10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

"First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg wants to make. If there are 30 kids and each kid gets 4 jello cups, we multiply 30 by 4:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs. Since one box makes 10 jello cups, we divide the total number of jello cups by 10:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost. Each box costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:
12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.00

So, Greg will spend $15.00 on jello.

"First, we need to find out how much Keenan pays in total for the month. Since Madeline pays 60%, Keenan pays the remaining 40%.

40% of $400 is calculated like this:
400 * 0.40 = 160

So, Keenan pays $160 in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in the month, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week.

160 / 4 = 40

Keenan spends $40 per week.

"First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces.

2/5 of 60 is:
2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

Now, let's see how many pieces were left after the first day:
60 - 24 = 36 pieces

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, the remaining pieces after the second day are:
36 - 10 = 26 pieces

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. Let's calculate that:
7/13 * 26 = 14 pieces

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces he has eaten so far:
24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48 pieces

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"First, let's find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, then one bottle of soda costs $21.00 divided by 7. 

$21.00 รท 7 = $3.00

So, one bottle of soda costs $3.00.

Next, let's find out how much one bottle of water costs. If 4 bottles of water cost $8, then one bottle of water costs $8 divided by 4.

$8 รท 4 = $2.00

So, one bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, if David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda, it will cost him 3 times $3.00.

3 ร $3.00 = $9.00

And if he wants to buy 2 bottles of water, it will cost him 2 times $2.00.

2 ร $2.00 = $4.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the soda and the water together.

$9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

So, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

1. **Multiple-choice questions:**
   - There are 10 multiple-choice questions.
   - Amy answers 80% of them correctly.
   - 80% of 10 is \( 0.80 \times 10 = 8 \) questions.
   - Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point.
   - So, she scores \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) points from multiple-choice questions.

2. **True/false questions:**
   - There are 20 true/false questions.
   - Amy answers 90% of them correctly.
   - 90% of 20 is \( 0.90 \times 20 = 18 \) questions.
   - Each true/false question is worth 1 point.
   - So, she scores \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) points from true/false questions.

3. **Long-answer questions:**
   - There are 5 long-answer questions.
   - Amy answers 60% of them correctly.
   - 60% of 5 is \( 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \) questions.
   - Each long-answer question is worth 5 points.

"First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them.

3/5 of 300 chickens = 300 * 3/5 = 180 chickens

Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens. He wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each.

Total money from selling 180 chickens = 180 * $50 = $9000

This $9000 includes his profit of $2000. To find out how much he spent to buy the chickens, we subtract the profit from the total money.

Cost of the chickens = $9000 - $2000 = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000.

"First, we need to find out how many glasses of lemonade the boys sold in total. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses together and Julie sold 14, we subtract Julie's sales from the total:

32 - 14 = 18

This means the boys sold 18 glasses together. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:

18 รท 2 = 9

So, each boy sold 9 glasses. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's find out how much Iris spent on the manicure. She spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair. Since she spent $400 on her hair, the cost of the manicure is:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure. Since the manicure cost $100, the cost of the pedicure is:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, Iris spent $575 at the spa.

"First, we need to find out how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope. She has a rope that is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, we multiply 20 meters by $2:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, Sarah has $40 from selling her rope. She wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope:

$40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters

Since Sarah can't buy a fraction of a meter of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. Now, we need to find out how much the 26 meters of new rope will cost:

26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling her old rope:

$40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.

"First, let's figure out how old Melanie is now. If in 10 years she will be 18, we can find her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.

18 - 10 = 8

So, Melanie is 8 years old now.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old. Since she is 8 years old now, we subtract her current age from 24 to find the number of years:

24 - 8 = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's figure out how much each item costs:

- Each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.
- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:

- The total cost for the bacon is 5 packs * $2 = $10.
- The total cost for the chicken is 6 packets * $4 = $24.
- The total cost for the strawberries is 3 packs * $4 = $12.
- The total cost for the apples is 7 packs * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total:

- Total cost = $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's see how much money Kelly has left in her budget:

"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to add up all the time he spends on different activities and then subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's add up all the time he spends:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Tim has:
- 7 blue shoe boxes
- 9 red shoe boxes

He uses:
- 3 blue shoe boxes
- 1/3 of his red shoe boxes

To find out how many red shoe boxes he uses, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9:
1/3 of 9 = 9 รท 3 = 3 red shoe boxes

Now, let's subtract the shoe boxes he uses from the total he has:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes

So, the total number of shoe boxes left is:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes

"First, let's find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean has 30 marbles, and he gives 1/5 of them to Jamie.

1/5 of 30 marbles is:
30 รท 5 = 6 marbles

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie and 10 marbles to Donald. Now, let's find out how many marbles Dean has left.

Dean originally had 30 marbles. He gave away 6 to Jamie and 10 to Donald, so he gave away a total of:
6 + 10 = 16 marbles

Now, subtract the marbles given away from the original number of marbles:
30 - 16 = 14 marbles

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that Duncan's age now is 60. So, eight years ago, Duncan was:
60 - 8 = 52 years old.

Next, we know that eight years ago, Duncan's age (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:
52 = 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago)

To find Adam's age four years ago, we divide 52 by 2:
52 / 2 = 26

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 years to 26:
26 + 4 = 30

Now, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
30 + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"First, let's figure out how big Farmer Smith's farm is. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be:
200 acres * 2 = 400 acres

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so:
400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

Now, to find out how many acres both farms have together, we add the sizes of both farms:
200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

"First, let's figure out how many packages Colby completes in one hour. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, that means he completes:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, if he completes 40 packages per hour and gets paid $0.20 for each package, his earnings per hour are:

40 packages * $0.20/package = $8.00 per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours in a typical workday, his total earnings for the day are:

$8.00/hour * 8 hours = $64.00.

So, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.

"First, let's figure out how long it takes John to finish an extreme Sudoku puzzle. 

A normal Sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, we multiply 45 minutes by 4:
45 minutes ร 4 = 180 minutes

Now, John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:
180 minutes รท 30 minutes/bottle = 6 bottles

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of red balloons and the bologna thrown at them:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - There are 20 red balloons.
   - So, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:
     \[
     20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - Out of these, 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
     \[
     58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces at red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pieces of bologna per yellow balloon} \times y \text{ yellow balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna}
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     3y = 18
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

"First, we need to find out how many miles Jon drives in a 30 day month. If he drives 100 miles a day, then in 30 days he drives:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we know that his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs in 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Julia and Nadine spent in total.

1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, and they bought 1 dozen (12 balloons). So, they bought 6 sets of 2 balloons:
   \[
   6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The ice cream costs $7 per tub, and they bought 2 tubs:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

This means Julia and Nadine together had $28. Since they both had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each one had:
\[
28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

Next, we know there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so:
16 boys + 22 girls = 38 students playing soccer.

Now, we add up all the students from each group:

300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Now, let's find out how much they spent to buy the lollipops. Each lollipop cost them $0.5, so:

300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the money made:

$240 - $150 = $90

"Let's figure this out step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3

Now, they use 500 gallons of water from the tank each day to water their garden. After 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

500 * 6 = 3000 gallons

To find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's calculate how much Colby has spent so far:
- He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, so that's 5 * $10 = $50.
- He saw 8 movies on other days, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.
- He had 2 tubs of popcorn, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.
- He had 4 boxes of candy, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

Now, let's add up all the money he has spent:
$50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so let's see how much he has left:
$150 - $130 = $20.

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. Let's see how much that will cost:
- Movie ticket on Friday: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Box of candy: $2

Total cost for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say John's age is \( J \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and John's ages, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( J \):
\[ J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, John is 20 years old.

Now, let's find Paul's age:
\[ J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add all the amounts together:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

"First, let's figure out how far James swims before he stops to rest. He swims 60% of the 20 miles, which is:

60% of 20 miles = 0.60 * 20 = 12 miles

Now, let's find out how long it takes him to swim the first 12 miles. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it takes is:

12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Next, he rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part. So, his rest time is:

6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

After resting, he has 8 miles left to swim (20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles). He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is:

2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

The time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:

8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Now, we add up all the times: the time for the first part of the swim, the rest time, and the time for the second part of the swim:

6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"First, we need to find out how many loaves of bread seven times Sam's loaves would be. Sam had 70 loaves, so:

7 times 70 = 490

Now, the bakery has 40 less than this number. So we subtract 40 from 490:

490 - 40 = 450

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- So, the commission per copy is 10% of $5, which is $5 * 0.10 = $0.50.
- Cayley sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times is $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- So, the commission per copy is 8% of $15, which is $15 * 0.08 = $1.20.
- Cayley sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00

So, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15.00.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points.
2. Bahati scored the most points, 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.
3. Let's say Azibo scored \( A \) points. Then Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
4. Since Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar, Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.
5. Adding all their points together, we get:
   \[
   A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3A + 30 = 45
   \]
7. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   3A = 15
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   A = 5
   \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to figure out how many pages fit into 1.5 inches. Since 100 pages make up 1 inch, we can multiply 100 pages by 1.5 inches to find the total number of pages.

100 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 150 pages

"First, let's figure out how many minutes Vince was stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:

900 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 60 sets

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each set of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by 30 reports:

60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

1800"
"First, let's figure out how many hours Kim usually sleeps. She goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., so that's 8 hours of sleep.

Now, let's convert 8 hours into minutes:
8 hours ร 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Next, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is:
2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so instead of waking up at 6 a.m., she woke up at 5:55 a.m. This means she lost 5 minutes of sleep.

Now, let's subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the extra 5 minutes she was awake:
480 minutes - 23 minutes - 5 minutes = 452 minutes

So, Kim slept 452 minutes on her bed that day.

452"
"First, let's figure out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. If he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups (which is 24 cups), then:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16 spoons

Now, if Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons left is:

16 spoons - 6 spoons = 10 spoons

Next, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils left:

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34.

"First, let's find out how many beds are occupied at the start. The hospital has 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied.

1000 beds * 1/5 = 200 beds occupied

Now, let's find out how many beds are unoccupied at the start.

1000 beds - 200 beds = 800 beds unoccupied

Next, we need to calculate how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, let's add these 700 patients to the 200 beds that were already occupied.

200 beds + 700 beds = 900 beds occupied

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total number of beds to find out how many beds are unoccupied after 2 weeks.

1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 beds unoccupied

Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years old

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can find out Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years old

"If Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but she overstated the number by 20%, we need to find out what 100% (the real number) is.

First, we know that 48 is 120% of the real number because she added an extra 20%. So, we can set up the problem like this:

48 = 120% of the real number

To find 100% (the real number), we divide 48 by 120 and then multiply by 100:

Real number = (48 / 120) * 100

Let's do the math:

Real number = (48 / 1.2) = 40

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many holes were dug by the end of the first day:
- The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.

Next, we add the holes dug on the second day:
- They dug 13 holes on the second day.
- Total holes by the end of the second day: 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

Now, let's add the holes dug on the third day:
- They dug 8 holes on the third day.
- Total holes by the end of the third day: 23 + 8 = 31 holes.

However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day:
- Total holes after filling in 2 holes: 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day:
- Four times the number of holes at the end of the first day: 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
- Holes dug on the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught \( A \) Pokemon.
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
3. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]
\[ 9A = 339 + 21 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, let's find out how many Stan has caught:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"First, let's figure out how far the bird flies in each direction.

1. Flying south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. Flying north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. Flying south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, let's add up the distances in the south direction and subtract the distance in the north direction to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

Total distance south:
\( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)

Total distance north:
\( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net distance south:
\( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \)

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party.
   4 dozen = 48 brownies

4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had:
12 (hers) + 6 (office) + 48 (friends) = 66 brownies

Next, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

Now, we add up all their ages:
Nani: 8 years
Brother: 16 years
Sister: 6 years

8 + 16 + 6 = 30

"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then add them all together.

First, for the synthetic gut racquets:
- Andy has 3 racquets to string with synthetic gut.
- It takes him 15 minutes for each racquet.
- So, for 3 racquets, it will take 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, for the polyester string racquets:
- Andy has 5 racquets to string with polyester string.
- It takes him 22 minutes for each racquet.
- So, for 5 racquets, it will take 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

Finally, for the hybrid set racquets:
- Andy has 4 racquets to string with a hybrid set.
- It takes him 18 minutes for each racquet.
- So, for 4 racquets, it will take 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we add all the times together:
- 45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester) + 72 minutes (hybrid) = 227 minutes.

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600
- Third phone: $300

Now, subtract the boxes she gave away from the total boxes she bought:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes

Next, Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes that is, we calculate:
1/4 of 8 boxes = 8 / 4 = 2 boxes

So, she kept 2 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:

On Saturday:
- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday:
- Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes, so on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

- She wants 3 petunias in each basket.
- So, the cost for petunias in one basket is 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00.

Next, let's find the cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- She wants 2 sweet potato vines in each basket.
- So, the cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00.

Now, let's add the costs for the petunias and sweet potato vines in one basket:
- Total cost for one basket = $9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00.

Finally, since she has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost for one basket by 5:
- Total cost for 5 baskets = 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00.

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"First, let's figure out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (for sunflowers) + 15 pounds (for carnations) = 27 pounds

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so with the remaining 3 pounds, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"First, we need to find out how much Jessica saves each month for shoes. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of that. 

25% of $2,000.00 is:
\[ 2,000.00 \times 0.25 = 500.00 \]

So, she saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 500.00 \times 12 = 6,000.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair costs $1,000.00, so:
\[ 6,000.00 \div 1,000.00 = 6 \]

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's figure out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. So, to peel 90 shrimp:
90 shrimp รท 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's figure out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. So, to saute 90 shrimp:
90 shrimp รท 30 shrimp/10 minutes = 3 times 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time for peeling and cooking:
15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low.
2. It cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high.
3. The room warms up 2 degrees an hour when the air conditioner is off.

First, the air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours:
- Cooling: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees

Next, it runs on high for 4 hours:
- Cooling: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees

Then, it is turned off for 2 hours:
- Warming: 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's add up all the changes:
- Total cooling: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees
- Total warming: 4 degrees

Final temperature change:
- 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.
2. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.
4. Since the comet appears every 75 years, the first time Bill saw the comet was 75 years before he saw it the second time.
5. Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and these trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes:
   \[
   44 \times 2 = 88 \text{ trips}
   \]

2. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, the number of flights to Greece is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \text{ flights}
   \]

3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The number of remaining flights is:
   \[
   88 - 66 = 22 \text{ flights}
   \]

4. Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
   \[
   \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ flights}
   \]

So, the number of flights to France is 11.

"First, let's figure out how long each wolf howls.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so:
20 seconds (Tobias) + 40 seconds (Chikote) = 60 seconds

Now, let's add up the total time all three wolves howl:
20 seconds (Tobias) + 40 seconds (Chikote) + 60 seconds (Igneous) = 120 seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total time to minutes:
120 seconds / 60 = 2 minutes

Now, let's add up all the money Adam received from his mother and father:

Total money received = Mother's contribution + Father's contribution
Total money received = $6 + $12
Total money received = $18

Adam bought the trousers for $30, so the amount he had to contribute from his savings is:

Amount from savings = Total cost - Total money received
Amount from savings = $30 - $18
Amount from savings = $12

"First, let's find out the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is 20 divided by 4, which is 5.

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so Helene is 5 times 2, which is 10 years old.

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- Helene is 10 years old.

To find Wilfred's age, we add up the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene, and then subtract that total from the total age of the group:
3 + 4 + 10 = 17

The total age of the group is 20, so Wilfred's age is 20 - 17, which is 3.

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, if each person in the church got 15 cookies, we need to find out how many people got cookies by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, 50 people were in the church next door.

"To find out how much the dance studio earns in a month, we need to calculate the total cost and then the earnings. But first, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session:**
   - The studio costs $25 to rent per session.

2. **Cost per student per session:**
   - Each student costs $1.50 per session.
   - With 10 students, the cost is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars per session.

3. **Total cost per session:**
   - The total cost per session is the sum of the rental cost and the cost for the students.
   - \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars per session.

4. **Number of sessions per week:**
   - The studio is rented 3 days a week.

5. **Total cost per week:**
   - The total cost per week is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

6. **Number of weeks in a month:**
   - We'll assume there are 4 weeks in a month.

7. **Total cost per month:**
   - The total cost per month is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

However, the question asks for the expected earnings, not the cost. If the question is about the total amount collected from students, we need to calculate the total revenue from the students.

8. **Revenue per student per session:**
   - Each student pays $1.50 per session.
   - With 10 students, the revenue per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.

9. **Total revenue per session:**
   - The total revenue per session is \(15\) dollars.

"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to figure out how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \]
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:
\[ 56 \div 7 = 8 \]
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:

So, there are 30 female porcupines.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. In one year, there are 12 months.

So, each female porcupine will give birth to 4 ร 12 = 48 babies in a year.

Since there are 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born in a year will be 30 ร 48 = 1440.

1. First, we divide 18 pages by 3 pages per set: 18 รท 3 = 6 sets.
2. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by 10 minutes: 6 ร 10 = 60 minutes.

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"Let's figure this out step by step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests left.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so we subtract 15 from 76:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests left.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. Adding these 30 guests to the 61 guests already there:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so we add 7 to 91:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

So, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz.

There are 60 questions in total. 
40% of these are easy questions:
40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 easy questions

The rest of the questions are 60 - 24 = 36 questions.
These 36 questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions:
36 / 2 = 18 average questions
36 / 2 = 18 difficult questions

Now, let's see how many questions Aries is sure to get right:
- She gets 75% of the easy questions right:
75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions

- She gets half of the average questions right:
50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9 average questions

- She gets half of the difficult questions right:
50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9 difficult questions

Adding these up, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get right is:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 questions

So, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we know that each small stuffed animal costs $4.
2. Teresa sold large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.
3. She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold L large stuffed animals. Then she sold 2L small stuffed animals.
4. The total money she made from selling the small stuffed animals is 2L * $4.
5. The total money she made from selling the large stuffed animals is L * $12.
6. The total money she made from all sales is $120.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 2L \times 4 + L \times 12 = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]

Now, solve for L:
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to add up the sandwiches each person eats per day and then multiply by 7 days.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we add the sandwiches eaten by each person per day:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Next, we multiply the total daily sandwiches by 7 days in a week:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"First, let's find out how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes.

From cookies:
80 cookies ร $1 per cookie = $80

From cupcakes:
60 cupcakes ร $4 per cupcake = $240

Total earnings from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so:
2 sisters ร $10 each = $20

Money left after giving her sisters:
$320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"First, let's figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.

1. A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, 50% of 24 is 12, and 24 + 12 = 36 pounds.

Now, if one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore in one day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds in one day.

In a month with 30 days, 40 dwarves can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore.

"To find out how much the package with 8 sandwiches costs, we need to see the pattern in the prices. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3. That means each sandwich costs $3 รท 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. That means each sandwich also costs $6 รท 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich should be the same for all packages. So, for the third package with 8 sandwiches, each sandwich still costs $1.50.

To find the total cost for 8 sandwiches, we multiply the cost per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.50 ร 8 = $12.

   - 40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Sally released half of the yellow balloons.
   - Half of 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.
   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6

4. **Blue Balloons Found:**
   - Sally found 8 blue balloons.

"To figure out the chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to look at all the different things that could happen.

1. There's a 50% chance a substitute teacher will be there, and if that happens, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. So, there's a 50% chance he doesn't have to turn it in because of the substitute.

2. If the normal teacher is there (which is the other 50% of the time), there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension to everyone. So, 50% (chance the normal teacher is there) times 40% (chance of an extension) equals 20%. This means there's a 20% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework because of a class extension.

3. If the normal teacher is there and doesn't give an extension (which is 50% times 60%, or 30% of the time), there's still a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his homework. So, 30% (chance the normal teacher is there and no class extension) times 20% (chance of a personal extension) equals 6%. This means there's a 6% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework because of a personal extension.

Now, we add up all the chances Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher)
- 20% (class extension)
- 6% (personal extension)

50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

So, there's a 76% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. To find the chance he will have to turn it in, we subtract this from 100%:

Now, we subtract the total parking cost from her total earnings to find out how much she makes after expenses:

$45 - $9 = $36

Finally, we need to find out how much she makes per hour. She works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so we multiply 6 by 3 to get the total hours:

"First, let's figure out how much money Jim borrowed for college. He borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years. So, the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Jim lost by not working during the 4 years he was in college. He could have earned $25,000 each year. So, the total money lost is:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

Now, let's add the total amount borrowed and the total money lost:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Jim's new job after college pays him three times what he used to earn. So, his new annual income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new salary, we divide the total amount by his new annual income:

\[ 300,000 \div 75,000 = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"First, we need to find out the size of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric piece will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of the fabric piece will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we need to find the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) x 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet x 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Let's say the first person took \( x \) dollars.
2. The second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars.
3. The third person took twice what the second person took, so that's \( 2 \times (x + 80) \).

Now, we know the total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2 \times (x + 80) = 1920 \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]

\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

"First, let's figure out how many days are in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 21 days.

Next, we need to find out how many hours are in 3/8ths of a day. A full day has 24 hours, so 3/8ths of a day is:
\[ 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 24 \times 0.375 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, if the painters worked 9 hours each day for 21 days, the total hours worked by the team is:
\[ 9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked:
\[ \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is \( x \).

In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

We know that the total number of balls he retrieved in all three sets is 19. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \).

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To get rid of the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory retrieved 6 balls.

Now, let's find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate how much the car's value decreases each year by 21% and then apply this decrease for each year from 2007 to 2010.

1. First, find the depreciation amount for one year:
   - 21% of $20000 = 0.21 ร 20000 = $4200

2. The car's value after one year (2008) is:
   - $20000 - $4200 = $15800

3. For the second year (2009), the car depreciates by 21% of $15800:
   - 21% of $15800 = 0.21 ร 15800 = $3318
   - The car's value after the second year is: $15800 - $3318 = $12482

4. For the third year (2010), the car depreciates by 21% of $12482:
   - 21% of $12482 = 0.21 ร 12482 = $2621.22
   - The car's value after the third year is: $12482 - $2621.22 = $9860.78

2. Each tile costs $12, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400.

"First, we need to find out how much more James has to pay each month because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it's 60% more now.

60% of $120 is:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to figure out how many loads he does each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's see how many loads he does each week:
- For the 4 twin beds, since he can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he needs to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.
- For the 1 king size bed, he needs to do 1 load for the king size bed.

So, each week he does 2 (for twin beds) + 1 (for the king bed) = 3 loads of laundry.

Now, there are 52 weeks in a year, so:
- 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads in a year.

"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down:

1. On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
2. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch:
4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks they will watch:
6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies

"To find out how many stickers Leo has now, we need to add up the stickers he had and collected over the years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice as many as last year, which means 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers he collected this year to his collection from last year:
150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection now.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we need to know how much food all the cats eat in one feeding. Since each cat eats 60 grams and there are 3 cats:
60 grams/cat ร 3 cats = 180 grams per feeding

Next, since the cats are fed twice a day, we need to find out how much food they eat in one day:
180 grams/feeding ร 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day

Now, we have 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount of food the cats eat each day:
720 grams รท 360 grams/day = 2 days

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we know that Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.
4. Now, we add up all the slices they ate: Becky's 10 slices + Jake's 7 slices + Silvia's 14 slices.

So, the total number of slices they ate is:
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

"Let's think about this step by step. If Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can say that if Donovan's part took \( D \) minutes, then Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. Together, they took 98 minutes to make the meal.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Now, let's solve for \( D \):
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, so:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost for the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is $300 / 2 = $150.
3. The cost for 30 painkillers at $4 each is 30 * $4 = $120.
4. The parking cost is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the total parking cost is 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482.

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

"First, let's figure out how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 14 pizzas.
So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas and has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means they ordered 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
80% of 40 is 32 pizzas.
So, the football team ate 32 pizzas and has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

Now, we add the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team.
6 pizzas from the glee club + 8 pizzas from the football team = 14 pizzas left.

"First, let's figure out how many big coupons Anthony is sending. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending 700 small coupons, he will send:

700 small coupons * 2 = 1400 big coupons

Now, let's calculate the cost for mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so:

700 small coupons * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Next, we calculate the cost for mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so:

1400 big coupons * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost:

3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):

24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

So, Anthony spends 245 dollars on postage total.

20 - 5 = 15 trucks

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 trucks is:
15 trucks ร 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

"To find out how much Dennis will spend on butter, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
   - He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   - So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""
   - This means for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the other pound.

3. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - For every 2 pounds, he pays $4.00 for the first pound and $2.00 (half of $4.00) for the second pound.
   - So, for 2 pounds, the total cost is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.
   - Since he needs 6 pounds, he will buy 3 sets of 2 pounds.
   - The total cost for 6 pounds is 3 sets * $6.00 = $18.00.

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

45 - 4 = 41 people

The theater costs $125 for the first 20 people. For the additional guests, we need to pay $6 for each one. Since 41 people are coming and 20 are included in the base price, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21 people

The cost for these additional guests is:

21 * 6 = $126

Now, we add the base price and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost:

"First, let's figure out how much money Maggie and Riza each spent.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money. Since Maggie had $60, a quarter of $60 is:
\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \]
So, Maggie spent $15.

Riza spent one-third of her money. Since Riza also had $60, one-third of $60 is:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]
So, Riza spent $20.

Now, let's find out how much money they each have left.

Maggie had $60 and spent $15, so she has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]
Maggie has $45 left.

Riza had $60 and spent $20, so she has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]
Riza has $40 left.

To find out how much money they have left together, we add Maggie's and Riza's remaining money:

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total bananas for a week:**
   Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.

2. **Total days in a week:**
   There are 7 days in a week.

3. **Total bananas eaten per day:**
   To find out how many bananas are eaten each day, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day}
   \]

4. **Bananas eaten by the first monkey:**
   The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

5. **Bananas eaten by the second monkey:**
   The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas} + 4 \text{ bananas} = 14 \text{ bananas per day}
   \]

6. **Bananas eaten by the third monkey:**
   The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas each day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total bananas eaten per day:
   \[
   45 \text{ bananas per day} - 10 \text{ bananas per day} - 14 \text{ bananas per day} = 21 \text{ bananas per day}

"First, let's figure out how much Jenny spends on the roses. 

Roses cost $2 each, but there's also a price for a dozen. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, we can break it down into 1 dozen and 3 extra roses.

- 1 dozen roses cost $15.
- 3 extra roses cost 3 * $2 = $6.

So, the total cost for 15 roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which means she had 5 * $5 = $25.

Now, let's find out how much change she gets back:
$25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to figure out how many quarters make up $4. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:
$4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters.

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200. We subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total she needs:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week to find out how many more weeks she needs to save:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, Melanie needs 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid. So, the selling price to his friend is:

\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price of $2000. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

"First, let's figure out how many classes John has in a day. He has 6 normal classes and 2 extra classes, so that's 6 + 2 = 8 classes a day.

Each class is 40 minutes long, so in one day, he spends 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes in class.

John goes to class 5 days a week, so in a week, he spends 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes in class.

Now, he spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday. So, for each day, he spends 1600 minutes / 16 = 100 minutes.

For both Saturday and Sunday, he spends 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes.

Adding this to his weekly class time, he spends 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes a week.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours.

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high, so each of these walls is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, they total 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Adding the areas of all four walls together, we get 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Next, we need to figure out how many gallons of paint Tony will need. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by 20: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, we need to find out how much it will cost to buy 12 gallons of paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is 12 x 12 = $144.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas, 3 of which are shaken.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken, 8 unshaken).
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas (2 shaken, 6 unshaken).

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda. We need to find the probability that the soda is one of the shaken ones.

There are 8 sodas left in total, and 2 of them are shaken. The probability of picking a shaken soda is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this as a percentage:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If one train is going 60 miles an hour, the other train is going half that speed, which is 30 miles an hour. 

After 3 hours, the first train would have traveled:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

And the second train would have traveled:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Since they are going in opposite directions, we add the distances together to find out how far apart they are:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

"First, let's figure out how many days Billy is working. March has 31 days, and April 1st to April 19th is 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off. So, 20% of 50 days is 0.20 ร 50 = 10 days off.

That means Billy works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours each day, so he helps 2 ร 3 = 6 people each day.

Over 40 days, he helps 6 ร 40 = 240 people.

12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the number of people the cars carried:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the number of people from the buses and the cars together:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length = 300 feet
- Speed = 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length = 240 feet
- Speed = 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

"First, let's figure out how much time Bobby spends on breaks and lunch each day.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. So, the total time for breaks and lunch each day is:
30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (first break) + 15 minutes (second break) = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means Bobby spends 1 hour on breaks and lunch each day.

Now, we need to find out how much time this adds up to over 5 days:
1 hour/day ร 5 days = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we multiply 8 by 3.5:

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. Together, they ran:

8 + 28 = 36 miles

The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:

52 - 36 = 16 miles

Ahito ran 16 miles.

"First, let's figure out what Sheila's credit card balance was after she returned the $15.00 item. She originally charged $85.00, so:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's find out how much the frying pan cost after the 20% discount. The original price was $20.00, so:

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 ร $20.00 = $4.00

The discount is $4.00, so the frying pan costs:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's find out how much the set of towels cost after the 10% discount. The original price was $30.00, so:

10% of $30.00 = 0.10 ร $30.00 = $3.00

The discount is $3.00, so the set of towels costs:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the balance after the return:

$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:

"Let's think about this step by step.

1. First, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. This means if we have \( x \) jellyfish in total, then \( \frac{x}{5} \) are large.
2. Out of these large jellyfish, a third change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( \frac{x}{5} \), which is \( \frac{x}{15} \).
3. We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]
\[ x = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ x = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - 40% of $100,000 is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars per year.
   - For 20 years, she needs \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate how much Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - 20% of $100,000 is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars per year.

3. **Determine how many years she needs to save:**
   - To save $800,000, she needs to save \( 800,000 \div 20,000 = 40 \) years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"If 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find out the total number of students in the school first. 

1. We know that 40% means 40 out of 100, so we can set up the equation:
   \[ 40\% \times \text{Total Students} = 240 \]
   \[ \frac{40}{100} \times \text{Total Students} = 240 \]

2. To find the total number of students, we solve for Total Students:
   \[ \text{Total Students} = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} \]
   \[ \text{Total Students} = 600 \]

3. Now, if the total number of students is 600 and 240 of them are boys, the number of girls is:
   \[ \text{Number of Girls} = \text{Total Students} - \text{Number of Boys} \]
   \[ \text{Number of Girls} = 600 - 240 \]

Now, let's see how many miles she will hike in 30 days:
250 miles/day ร 30 days = 7,500 miles.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. So, the extra miles she needs to hike are:
9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the extra miles by the number of days:

"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total cost for each color of ball and then add them all together.

1. For the red balls:
   - There are 3 red balls.
   - Each red ball costs $9.
   - So, the total cost for the red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

2. For the blue balls:
   - There are 11 blue balls.
   - Each blue ball costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

3. For the green balls:
   - There are 25 green balls.
   - Each green ball costs $3.
   - So, the total cost for the green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, we add the total costs for all the balls together:
- Total cost = $27 (red) + $55 (blue) + $75 (green) = $157.

So, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance John drives to visit his parents.
2. Double that distance to get the round trip distance.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits he makes in a month.

First, we know that John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph to get to his parents' house. To find the one-way distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

This is the one-way distance. For a round trip, he drives this distance twice:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

- The first 2 workers make 6 toys each per hour. So together, they make:
  6 toys/hour + 6 toys/hour = 12 toys/hour

- The next 2 workers make 4 toys each per hour. So together, they make:
  4 toys/hour + 4 toys/hour = 8 toys/hour

Now, let's add the toys made by all 4 workers in one hour:
12 toys/hour + 8 toys/hour = 20 toys/hour

Next, we need to find out how many toys these 4 workers make in 10 hours:
20 toys/hour ร 10 hours = 200 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means the 5 workers together made:
400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys

Since the first 4 workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must have made:
380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys

Now, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour. Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours:
180 toys รท 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

   \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

3. **Time spent on the sidewalk**: She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, so the time spent on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time for the walk**: The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"First, let's find out how much Jane has already saved. She saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks.

$4 x 8 = $32

So, Jane has saved $32 so far. She wants to save a total of $60. Let's find out how much more she needs to save.

$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save $28 if she continues to save $4 each week.

$28 รท $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add up all the birds from each tree. 

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
3 trees * 7 birds/tree = 21 birds

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 birds/tree = 8 birds

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 birds/tree = 3 birds

Now, we add all the birds together:
21 birds + 8 birds + 3 birds = 32 birds

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:

"First, let's figure out how many marbles Bob has right now. If Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 24 marbles. So, if Bob gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Bob has now, we take 60 and subtract 24:
60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob has 36 marbles right now. If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36:
36 - 10 = 26

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this, we need to figure out the temperature of the water in Donny's water bottle after he mixes the water from both mugs.

1. Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water into his water bottle.
2. He also pours 1 ounce of water from the second mug into his water bottle.
3. The total amount of water in the water bottle is now 5 ounces.
4. The temperature of the water in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it.

Let's call the temperature of the water in the second mug \( T \) degrees.

The formula to find the final temperature when mixing different amounts of water at different temperatures is:
\[ \text{Final Temperature} = \frac{\text{Total Heat}}{\text{Total Volume}} \]

The total heat is the sum of the heat from each part of the water:
\[ \text{Total Heat} = (4 \text{ ounces} \times 33 \text{ degrees}) + (1 \text{ ounce} \times T \text{ degrees}) \]

The total volume is:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 4 \text{ ounces} + 1 \text{ ounce} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the final temperature is:
\[ \text{Final Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \]

We know the final temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"First, let's figure out how many cows and chickens Melanie's father gets each day and then for three weeks.

He starts with:
- 50 cows
- 20 chickens

Each day, he gets:
- 20 more cows from Milkie Cows Limited
- 10 more chickens from Broilers Limited

Three weeks have 21 days. So, in 21 days, he gets:
- 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add these to the original numbers:
- Total cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows
- Total chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Finally, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals:
- Total animals = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"First, let's find out how much 4 packs of bagels cost without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, since he gets a 10% discount on the total cost, we need to calculate the discount amount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Russell ordered 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

"First, let's figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. 

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so:
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are used to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. 

It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So:
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

This means 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. 

If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then for 18 scoops:
18 scoops / 2 scoops = 9
9 * 3 potatoes = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

Next, for the next 30 days, he eats 5 eggs a day, so:
5 eggs/day ร 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, let's add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens 240 eggs make:
240 eggs รท 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

17 green jelly beans * 2 = 34 red jelly beans

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. We can find out how many blue jelly beans there are by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:
60 total jelly beans - 17 green jelly beans - 34 red jelly beans = 9 blue jelly beans

So, the number of blue jelly beans is:

"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, figure out how many lemons Tim gets from one tree in one year. We know that's 6 lemons.
2. Then, since Tim has 5 trees, we multiply the number of lemons from one tree by the number of trees to find out how many lemons he gets in one year from all the trees. So, 6 lemons/tree ร 5 trees = 30 lemons in one year.
3. A decade is 10 years, so we need to find out how many lemons he gets in 10 years. We multiply the number of lemons he gets in one year by 10. So, 30 lemons/year ร 10 years = 300 lemons in a decade.

"First, we need to find out how many men and women were on the bus at the start. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 people (5 men + 9 women), 5 are men and 9 are women.

The total number of passengers is 84. We can find out how many groups of 14 are in 84 by dividing 84 by 14:
84 รท 14 = 6

This means there are 6 groups of 14 people. Since each group has 9 women, we can find the total number of women by multiplying 9 by 6:
9 ร 6 = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus at the start. If 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from 54 to find out how many women are left:
54 - 20 = 34

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's figure out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sells in one day.

1. **Sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers each day.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers / Cost per sunflower
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13

2. **Bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets each day.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets / Cost per bouquet
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7

3. **Sunflowers in bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = Number of bouquets sold per day * Sunflowers per bouquet
   - Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = 7 * 12 = 84

4. **Total sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers sold individually + Sunflowers in bouquets
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84 = 97

5. **Total sunflowers sold in 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * 3
   - Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 97 * 3 = 291

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291.

"First, let's figure out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide 100 by 5:

100 รท 5 = 20 rocks

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks. If he sells 60% of his inventory, we need to find out how many rocks that is:

20 rocks ร 60% = 20 rocks ร 0.60 = 12 rocks

Adam sells 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7, so the money he makes from selling the rocks is:

12 rocks ร $7 = $84

Adam started with $100 and spent it all on buying rocks. After selling 12 rocks, he has $84. To find out how much money he lost, we subtract the money he made from the money he started with:

$100 - $84 = $16

"To find out how many days Lauren needs to complete all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the time for each size of picture scenes separately and then add them up.

1. For the large-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
   - So, the number of days for large scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. For the medium-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
   - So, the number of days for medium scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. For the small-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
   - So, the number of days for small scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is the same as 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, we multiply 20% by 3:
20% * 3 = 60%
This means the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning, which is the same as 0.60.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets win, we multiply the probabilities:

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
5. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

1. Let's say the length of the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37

3. Let's find out how much money Rissa gave to her little sister. If Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money, she gave away \( 1 - \frac{4}{5} = \frac{1}{5} \) of her money.
4. Rissa's total money was $15, so she gave away \( \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \) dollars.

Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie also gave away $3.

5. Ronnie originally had $5, and he gave away $3, so he is left with \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) dollars.

So, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. The mural used 12 pints of paint in total.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so that means 6 pints of paint are yellow.
3. The remaining half of the mural is made up of red, white, and purple paint, which are in equal amounts.
4. Since the remaining half is 6 pints, and this is split equally among red, white, and purple, each color gets 6 pints divided by 3 colors.

So, each color (red, white, and purple) gets 2 pints.

"First, let's find the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so:
20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet

Tom has 4 bedrooms, so the total area for the bedrooms is:
240 square feet * 4 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:
240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet

Now, let's add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
960 square feet (bedrooms) + 1200 square feet (living room) + 1000 square feet (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet

So, the total area of the house is:
3160 square feet

"Let's figure this out step by step:

- On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.
- On Tuesday, she counts double the number from Monday, so 3 x 2 = 6 clouds.
- On Wednesday, she counts double the number from Tuesday, so 6 x 2 = 12 clouds.
- On Thursday, she counts double the number from Wednesday, so 12 x 2 = 24 clouds.
- On Friday, she counts double the number from Thursday, so 24 x 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up all the clouds she counted from Monday to Friday:

"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box of 100 pods.

20% of 100 pods is:
20/100 * 100 = 20 pods

So, the special size box has:
100 + 20 = 120 pods

The special size box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many pods you get for $1, we divide the number of pods by the cost:

120 pods / 12 dollars = 10 pods per dollar

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

"First, let's figure out how many $20 bills Thomas gets when he withdraws $1000. 

$1000 divided by $20 is 50 bills.

If he loses 10 bills, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Each of these 20 bills is worth $20, so he has 20 * $20 = $400.

Thomas then triples his money, so he has $400 * 3 = $1200.

Now, he converts all his money into $5 bills. 

$1200 divided by $5 is 240 bills.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

3. Total goals scored in the match:
   - Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
   - Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.
   - Total: 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Initial Chalk Length on Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday:**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk.
   - 45% of 5 inches is \( 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - So, the chalk used on Monday is 2.25 inches.

3. **Chalk Left After Monday:**
   - The remaining chalk is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

4. **Chalk Usage Each Day After Monday:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - 20% of 2.75 inches is \( 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \) inches.

5. **Chalk Left After Each Day:**
   - After the first day (Tuesday), the chalk left is \( 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - After the second day (Wednesday), the chalk left is \( 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \) inches.

6. **Recycling Condition:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - After the first day (Tuesday), the chalk is 2.20 inches, which is more than 2 inches.
   - After the second day (Wednesday), the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

So, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days before he has to recycle it.

There are 12 girls, and one-third of them are on varsity:
12 girls * 1/3 = 4 girls on varsity

There are 12 boys, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
12 boys * 1/4 = 3 boys on varsity

Now, let's find out how many students are not on varsity.

Total students in the class:

"First, let's find out how many teeth the dentist fixes in total. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

James has 30 teeth in total. To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons

This means 1600 gallons of milk were returned because they were sour. The cost of the milk was $3.5 per gallon, so to find out how much he got refunded, we multiply the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon:

1600 * 3.5 = 5600

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. Seven years from now, Colin will be \( C + 7 \) years old.
3. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, so Wendy's current age is \( 5 \times (C + 7) \).

Now, let's look at the second part of the problem:
4. In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old.
5. At that time, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5 \times (C + 7) \).

Let's solve this equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3} \times (C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}C + \frac{35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's first figure out how many slices of each type of pizza her friends will eat in total.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza. So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all her friends is:
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Each of Kate's 6 friends also eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all her friends is:
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Now, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type.

For the cheese pizza, each pie is cut into 12 slices. To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza, each pie is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Total pizzas needed:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many snowballs Jay actually makes in an hour. He makes 20 snowballs, but some melt. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, in one hour (which has 4 sets of 15 minutes), 2 x 4 = 8 snowballs will melt.

So, in one hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs but loses 8, which means he ends up with 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for him to have 60 snowballs. If he makes 12 snowballs in one hour, we can divide 60 by 12 to find out how many hours it will take.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they got 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's add up all the bandages they used and received over the three days:
- Total bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
- Total bandages received: 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day is the sum of the bandages they started with, plus the bandages they received, minus the bandages they used.

Let's call the number of bandages they started with \( x \).

So, the equation is:
\[ x + 150 - 91 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 59 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so in one week, she earns:
45 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $67.5/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her earnings from her hourly work for the month are:
$67.5/week * 4 weeks = $270

Jen also gets an additional $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she had no absences for all 4 weeks, she gets:

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, on the second day, he planted 1/4 more than the 40 he planted on the first day. So, 1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 more trees. This means he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Adding the Lodgepole Pine trees from both days, he planted 40 + 50 = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees in total.

- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Next, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
- The price per kilogram is $0.50.

Total earnings = 128 * 0.50 = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

"To find out how much Trinity sells the magazines for, we need to multiply the price she bought them by 11/8. 

First, let's calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

To find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

"First, let's figure out how much water the dehumidifier removes on each setting per day:
- On the low setting, it removes 1 liter of water per day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters of water per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed on each setting:
- On the low setting for 3 days: 1 liter/day ร 3 days = 3 liters
- On the medium setting for 3 days: 2 liters/day ร 3 days = 6 liters
- On the high setting for 5 days: 4 liters/day ร 5 days = 20 liters

Finally, let's add up all the water removed:
3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters

"First, we need to find out how many balloons they started with. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, we multiply 10 packs by 30 balloons per pack:

10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Next, we need to find out how many balloons they used. They started with 300 balloons and had 12 left at the end. So, we subtract the 12 balloons left from the 300 balloons they started with:

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons

So, they threw 288 balloons.

"To find out how many mL of medicine Saanvi would need for 8 doses, we first need to figure out how much medicine is in one dose.

1. Saanvi needs 14 mL of the first medicine.
2. She needs 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

Now, we add the amounts of both medicines to find the total amount for one dose:
14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

This is the amount of medicine in one dose. For 8 doses, we multiply this amount by 8:
56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

So, the total amount of medicine for 8 doses is 448 mL.

448 mL"
"First, let's find out how many students can fit in one of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class can hold 120 students, we do:

120 students รท 8 = 15 students

This means each of John's classes can hold 15 students. Since John has two classes, the total number of students his school can hold is:

15 students/class ร 2 classes = 30 students

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the number of students Ali's school can hold to the number of students John's school can hold:

120 students + 30 students = 150 students

"First, let's figure out how much interest Stephen has to pay. He borrowed $300 and promised to return an additional 2% of this amount as interest.

2% of $300 is:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to pay back is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. The total amount he will pay in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, Stephen will pay:

"Jordan has 2 children, and each child needs 5 diaper changes a day. So, the total number of diaper changes needed per day is:

2 children ร 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Jordan's wife changes half of these diapers, so she changes:

10 diaper changes รท 2 = 5 diaper changes

This means Jordan changes the other half:

10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"First, let's figure out the total volume of the jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches at the base and 15 inches tall. So, the volume is:

\[ 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans can fit in the jar. Since the jelly beans only fill about 80% of the jar's volume, we calculate:

\[ 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so the number of jelly beans that can fit is:

\[ \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \text{ jelly beans} \]

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans he estimates is:

\[ 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \text{ red jelly beans} \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his estimate from the true number:

\[ 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **First stop**: 40 people entered the bus.
   - Total people on the bus after the first stop: 20 + 40 = 60 people.
3. **Second stop**: 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: 3/4 * 40 = 30 people.
   - Total people on the bus after the second stop: 60 + 30 = 90 people.
4. **Third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Total people on the bus after the third stop: 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Now, we need to find out how many more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus:
- Bus capacity: 200 people.
- Current number of people on the bus: 180 people.
- Remaining spaces: 200 - 180 = 20 people.

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

"First, let's figure out how much Pauline spends in the first 5 years. She visits the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2.

So, for one year, she spends:
3 visits/year * $2/visit = $6/year

For 5 years, she spends:
5 years * $6/year = $30

Next, we need to find out the new cost of a visit after 5 years. The cost increases by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of $2 and add it to the original cost.

150% of $2 is:
150/100 * $2 = $3

So, the new cost of one visit is:
$2 + $3 = $5

Now, for the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year at the new cost of $5 per visit.

For one year, she spends:
3 visits/year * $5/visit = $15/year

For 3 years, she spends:
3 years * $15/year = $45

Finally, to find the total amount Pauline spent over the 8 years, we add the amount spent in the first 5 years to the amount spent in the next 3 years.

Total amount spent:
$30 + $45 = $75

"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- So, the total cost for the tables is 4 tables * $20/table = $80.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- So, the total cost for the roof frames is 2 frames * $10/frame = $20.

Now, we add the total cost of the tables and the frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of tables + Cost of frames
- Total cost = $80 + $20 = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"To solve this, let's think about it step by step. If the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can call the shorter piece \( x \) feet. This means the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, which is 4 times the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much of the secret seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs he wants to make by the number of meatballs per pound:

80 meatballs รท 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Now, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

5 pounds ร 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute.
   - 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. Now, add the costs of both parts together:

   So, Carly needs 10 treats in total.

2. Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly makes is \(C\).

3. According to the problem, the number of brownies Carly makes is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes. So, the number of brownies is:
   \[3C - 2\]

4. The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) is 10, so we can write the equation:
   \[C + (3C - 2) = 10\]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[4C - 2 = 10\]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \(C\):
   \[4C = 12\]

7. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(C\):
   \[C = 3\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's find out how much the manicure and pedicure cost together with the discount.

The manicure costs $35 and the pedicure costs $40. Together, they cost:
$35 + $40 = $75

The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both. So, the discount is:
20% of $75 = 0.20 ร $75 = $15

The discounted price for both the manicure and pedicure is:
$75 - $15 = $60

Now, let's add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers. She has 10 fingers, and each nail art costs $3. So, the total cost for the nail art is:

"First, let's find out what the price of the toy was in December after it increased by 80%.

The price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by 80% of $40.

80% of $40 is calculated like this:
80/100 * 40 = 32

So, the price in December was:
40 + 32 = $72

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price went down by half of $72.

50% of $72 is:
50/100 * 72 = 36

So, the price in January was:
72 - 36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January was $36.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to add up the costs of all the ingredients he uses each week and then multiply by the number of weeks in a year.

1. The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box.
2. The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
3. The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, so it's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up the weekly cost:
- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Gruyere cheese: $6.00

Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52:

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many books each shelf can hold:
- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each bookcase can hold:
- Middle shelves: 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, the total number of books one bookcase can hold is:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 116 + 4 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = \frac{120}{6} \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, the number of strawberry cubes is 20.

Now, let's find the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is 96.

"To find out how many points Ara has scored in four years, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many games she has played in total. Since she plays 40 games every year and has been playing for 4 years, we multiply 40 games by 4 years.
   \[
   40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games}
   \]

2. Next, we know that she scores 21 points in each game. To find the total points, we multiply the number of games by the points per game.
   \[
   160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points}
   \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:

"To figure out how many calls Jason needs to make, we can break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to know how many customers need to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 buys a car, we can say:
   - 15 cars * 2 customers per car = 30 customers

2. Next, we need to find out how many calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers to come in. Since for every 25 calls, 1 customer comes in, we can say:
   - 30 customers * 25 calls per customer = 750 calls

So, Jason needs to make 750 calls to sell 15 cars.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Flashlights:**
   - Each person has 1 flashlight.
   - There are 4 people.
   - So, the total number of flashlights is \(4 \times 1 = 4\).

2. **Flashlights in rooms:**
   - There are 8 rooms.
   - Each room has 2 flashlights.
   - So, the total number of flashlights in the rooms is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).

3. **Total flashlights:**
   - Flashlights for people: 4
   - Flashlights in rooms: 16
   - Total flashlights: \(4 + 16 = 20\)

4. **Candles:**
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each.
   - Half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each.
   - There are 8 rooms, so half of 8 is 4 rooms.
   - For the 4 rooms with small candles: \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
   - For the 4 rooms with medium candles: \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.

5. **Total candles:**
   - Small candles: 16
   - Medium candles: 20
   - Total candles: \(16 + 20 = 36\)

6. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**
   - Total flashlights: 20
   - Total candles: 36

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
3. The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
4. The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.
5. The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the times:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that 4 plants need half a cup of water each. So, for these 4 plants:
   \( 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \) cups of water.

2. Next, 8 plants need 1 cup of water each. So, for these 8 plants:
   \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) cups of water.

3. The rest of the plants are the total number of plants minus the ones we've already counted:
   \( 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \) plants.
   These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. So, for these 8 plants:
   \( 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \) cups of water.

4. Now, we add up all the water needed:
   \( 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \) cups of water.

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To figure out how long it will take Phineas Frog to get back home, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the part on land and the part in water.

1. **Total Distance**: Phineas is 200 yards away from his home.
2. **Distance on Land**: Half of 200 yards is 100 yards.
3. **Distance in Water**: The other half is also 100 yards.

Now, let's calculate the time for each part:

- **Time on Land**: 
  - Speed on land is 20 yards per minute.
  - Distance on land is 100 yards.
  - Time = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

- **Time in Water**:
  - Speed in water is 10 yards per minute.
  - Distance in water is 100 yards.
  - Time = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, we add the time for both parts to get the total time:

- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
2. On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so:
   50 + 20 = 70 people.
3. On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so:
   2 * 70 = 140 people.
4. For the rest of the week (4 more days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, for 4 days:
   4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up all the people Conor saw over the week:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week) = 500 people.

"To figure out how many lemons Tim needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Lemons for the pool party:**
   - Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice for 1 gallon of lemonade.
   - He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - So, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 cups of juice, he needs \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) lemons.

2. **Lemons for Allen's extra gallon:**
   - Allen wants 1 gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - For a regular gallon, 1 cup of lemon juice is needed.
   - For a gallon that is twice as tart, 2 cups of lemon juice are needed.
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 2 cups of juice, he needs \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) lemons.

3. **Total lemons needed:**
   - For the pool party: 24 lemons
   - For Allen's extra gallon: 12 lemons

"To find out how much dog food the kennel house will need in a week, we first need to calculate the daily food requirement for all the dogs and then multiply that by 7 days.

1. Calculate the daily food requirement for the German Shepherds:
   - Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of food per day.
   - There are 3 German Shepherds.
   - So, 3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms = 15 kilograms per day.

2. Calculate the daily food requirement for the Bulldogs:
   - Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of food per day.
   - There are 2 Bulldogs.
   - So, 2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms = 6 kilograms per day.

3. Add the daily food requirements for both types of dogs:
   - 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms per day.

4. Calculate the weekly food requirement:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour. To find out how far he went, we multiply the time by the speed:
5 hours * 18 mph = 90 miles

So, Elvis is 90 miles west of his house after the first part of his trip.

Next, Elvis turns around and drives east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 miles per hour. Again, we multiply the time by the speed to find out how far he went:
8 hours * 18 mph = 144 miles

Since he is driving east, he is moving back towards his house. We need to subtract the distance he drove east from the distance he drove west to find out how far he is from his house now:
144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles east of his house now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat originally costs $9000.
   - It depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   - 30% of $9000 is \( 0.30 \times 9000 = 2700 \).
   - So, after the first year, the boat is worth \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat is now worth $6300.
   - It depreciates by another 30% in the second year.
   - 30% of $6300 is \( 0.30 \times 6300 = 1890 \).
   - So, after the second year, the boat is worth \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat is now worth $4410.
   - It depreciates by 20% in the third year.
   - 20% of $4410 is \( 0.20 \times 4410 = 882 \).
   - So, after the third year, the boat is worth \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \).

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

- So, the total cost for the hotel is 3 nights * $80/night = $240.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus rides:
- Each bus ride costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
- 10% of $80 is $80 * 10/100 = $8.
- Helen rode the bus 7 times.
- So, the total cost for the bus rides is 7 rides * $8/ride = $56.

Now, let's add the cost of the hotel and the bus rides together:

5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Now, let's subtract the cost of the trays from the total money she made:
$80 (total money made) - $20 (cost of trays) = $60

So, Frances has $60 left.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. At the end of the first street, there are 5 children following the truck.
2. On the second street, each of these 5 children is joined by another child. So, 5 children each bring 1 more child, which adds 5 more children. Now, the total number of children is 5 (original) + 5 (new) = 10 children.
3. On the third street, each of these 10 children is joined by 2 more children. So, 10 children each bring 2 more children, which adds 20 more children. Now, the total number of children is 10 (existing) + 20 (new) = 30 children.
4. The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we subtract the 5 original children from the total. 30 - 5 = 25 children.

So, the final number of children following the truck is 25.

"Mamou started with 1,360 meals. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. To find out how many meals she has left, we need to subtract the meals she gave out from the total number of meals.

First, let's add up the meals she gave out:
64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Now, subtract the total meals given out from the original number of meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

"To find out how much money James has, we need to add up the value of each type of coin he found.

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents, and he found two nickels, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents, and he found 7 dimes, so that's 10 * 7 = 70 cents.

Now, we add all the values together:
25 (quarter) + 10 (nickels) + 70 (dimes) = 105 cents

So, James has 105 cents.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of each brother and sister.

First, we know there are 3 sisters, and each is 16 years old. So, the total age for the sisters is:
3 sisters * 16 years/sister = 48 years

Next, we know one brother is 12 years old. The problem states that this brother is half the age of the older brother. So, the older brother is:
12 years * 2 = 24 years

Now, we add the ages of both brothers:
12 years + 24 years = 36 years

Finally, we add the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers:
48 years + 36 years = 84 years

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years.

"First, let's figure out how much time Charisma spends on meditation each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, so that's 15 + 15 = 30 minutes of meditation each day.

Next, let's find out how much time she spends on meditation in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days. So, the total meditation time in 4 weeks is 30 minutes/day x 28 days = 840 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the yoga time. She practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. In 4 weeks, that's 1 hour/day x 5 days/week x 4 weeks = 20 hours.

To find the total time spent on both activities, we need to convert the yoga time to minutes. 20 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 1200 minutes.

Finally, we add the meditation and yoga times together: 840 minutes + 1200 minutes = 2040 minutes.

- Dimes are worth 10 cents each. So, 95 dimes are worth 95 * 10 = 950 cents.
- Nickels are worth 5 cents each. So, 120 nickels are worth 120 * 5 = 600 cents.
- Pennies are worth 1 cent each. So, 750 pennies are worth 750 * 1 = 750 cents.

Now, we add all these values together to get the total in cents:
800 + 950 + 600 + 750 = 3100 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we divide 3100 by 100 to get the total in dollars:

"To solve this, let's think about it step by step. 

1. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs.
2. Let's say the number of chickens is \( C \) and the number of cows is \( K \).
3. We have two pieces of information:
   - The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
   - The total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

4. We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   - \( C + 2K = 35 \).

5. Now we have two equations:
   - \( C + K = 20 \)
   - \( C + 2K = 35 \)

6. We can subtract the first equation from the second to find \( K \):
   - \( (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \)
   - \( K = 15 \)

7. Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting \( K \) back into the first equation:
   - \( C + 15 = 20 \)
   - \( C = 5 \)

So, the number of chickens is 5.
