"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total costs from this value.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: $80,000
2. **Cost of Repairs**: $50,000
3. **Total Costs**: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house:

4. **Increase in Value**: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
5. **New Value of the House**: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, we calculate the profit:

6. **Profit**: New Value - Total Costs = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Total feed needed = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken per day
   Total feed needed = 20 chickens × 3 cups/chicken
   Total feed needed = 60 cups

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   Morning feed = 15 cups
   Afternoon feed = 25 cups
   Total feed given = Morning feed + Afternoon feed
   Total feed given = 15 cups + 25 cups
   Total feed given = 40 cups

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   Feed needed for final meal = Total feed needed - Total feed given
   Feed needed for final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups
   Feed needed for final meal = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses where every second glass is 60% of the regular price, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses. Therefore, for 16 glasses, there are 8 pairs of glasses.

For each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

The total cost for one pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost for 16 glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distances John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return trip is 4 hours and he has already spent 2.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before selling at the orange house, she had \(5 \times 2 = 10\) vacuum cleaners.
2. Before selling at the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners, which means that the 10 vacuum cleaners were what was left after selling 2 more to the red house. Therefore, before selling to the red house, she had \(10 + 2 = 12\) vacuum cleaners.
3. The 12 vacuum cleaners were what was left after selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If 12 vacuum cleaners represent the remaining two-thirds (since she sold a third), then the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is \(12 \div (2/3) = 12 \times (3/2) = 18\).

Thus, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S = 40 \)), we can find the number of gold coins (\( G \)) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships described in the problem step by step.

1. First, we find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]

2. Next, we determine how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each segment of his ping pong play and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
- Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we sum the points from both segments:
- Points in the first 20 minutes: 4
- Points in the second 20 minutes: 5

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts consumed in 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine the cost per yogurt.
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts.
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles/hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles/hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her usual distance. Without the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw it:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories you can consume from the chips without exceeding your daily calorie target.
3. Convert the allowable calories into grams of chips.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.**

- The bag has 5 servings.
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

**Step 2: Determine how many calories you can consume from the chips.**

- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Remaining calories you can consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

**Step 3: Convert the allowable calories into grams of chips.**

- Each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g.
- Therefore, each serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60g.
- To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we use the ratio of calories to grams:
  - 250 calories = 60g
  - 1 calorie = 60g / 250 calories = 0.24g
  - 200 calories = 200 * 0.24g = 48g

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   - Cost of each blue tie = $40
   - Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on all ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

"John drinks water with his meals and before bed every weekday, which amounts to 4 glasses of water per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water from Monday to Friday. On the weekends, he only drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, which is 3 glasses of water per day. So, for Saturday and Sunday, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. Adding the weekday and weekend totals together, John drinks 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water in a week.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given rate of the fog's movement and the total distance it needs to cover.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the fog's movement is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

The city is 42 miles across. To find the total time it takes for the fog to cover 42 miles, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \text{Time} = \left( \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles}} \right) \times 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Simplifying the proportion:
\[ \text{Time} = 14 \times 10 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of how many pieces Poppy and her mom place and then determine how many pieces are left.

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after Poppy places her pieces, there are:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

2. Her mom then places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after her mom places her pieces, there are:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. Finally, we multiply that by 3 to get the total volume.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \( 3 \) inches × \( 4 \) inches × \( 2 \) inches
   - Inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × Number of boxes
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches × 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 72 \) cubic inches

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and then solve for the unknown.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Each day he watched a 1-hour episode.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours

2. **Wednesday**: He watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched.
   - Total for Wednesday: \(0.5x\) hours

3. **Thursday**: He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours

4. **Friday**: He watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours

Now, we know the total TV watching time for the week is 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine the known hours:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of both combined.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We can set up the following proportion to find out how many parts of the total 120 correspond to the sugar:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Where \( x \) is the number of teaspoons of sugar. To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve the equation:

\[
7 \times 120 = 20 \times x
\]

\[

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. According to the information, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can calculate the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago
Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.

\[ 40000 = L + 0.30L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later
Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% from his salary four years ago.

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later
Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), we calculate her salary four years later.

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 43076.92 \]

### Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 99076.92 \]

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.
3. The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles.

We can set up the equation to find the miles walked on Wednesday:
\[ \text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday} + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]
\[ 4 + 24 + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]
\[ 28 + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 that many bees return. So, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. We need to determine how many bees had left and not returned before this last period.

   - Initially, 30 bees left.
   - 15 bees returned.
   - Then, 60 more bees left.

   The total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees}
   \]

   Out of these 90 bees, 15 had already returned. Therefore, the number of bees that had left and not returned is:
   \[
   90 - 15 = 75 \text{ bees}
   \]

   So, in the last 6 hours, 75 bees return to the hive.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of price increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to calculate how many two-month periods are in 36 months.
   \[
   \text{Number of increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

2. **Calculate the price after each increase**: Each increase is 20% of the original price, which means the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20%) after each increase.

3. **Apply the increase 18 times**: The formula to find the final price after 18 increases is:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]
   Substituting the original price of $20:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

4. **Calculate the value**:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to gather enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans.
   - Each flan requires 3 eggs.
   - Therefore, 15 flans require \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \) eggs.

2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs.
   - Each babysitting session provides 9 eggs.
   - To find out how many sessions are needed, divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs per session: \( \frac{45}{9} = 5 \).

Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to gather enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the amount of money Ethel has as \( E \) and the amount of money Jimmy has as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Ethel has $8, so \( E = 8 \).
- Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, so \( J = 2E + 2 \).

Substituting \( E = 8 \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[ J = 2(8) + 2 \]
\[ J = 16 + 2 \]
\[ J = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his walking routine on weekdays and weekends. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

- On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 weekdays, he walks:
  \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \)

- On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 weekend days, he walks:
  \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \)

Adding these together gives the total miles walked in a week:
\( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \)

"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat**: The hat costs $25.
2. **Cost of the jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost.
4. Calculate the cost of lemons based on the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. They made a profit of $25. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = 3 \text{ (lemons)} + 2 \text{ (sugar)} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made. The total cost is:
\[ C = 5G \]

The total revenue is the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total number of glasses sold is:
\[ \text{Total glasses} = 20G \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \]

Now we can set up the equation for profit:
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 5G \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Amount Given to Daughter and Wife:**
   \[
   \text{Amount Given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Final Remaining Amount:**
   \[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + \frac{28}{2}
     \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + 14
     \]
     \[
     M - 2 = 19
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides to solve for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 21
     \]

4. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark:
     \[
     \text{Jean's age} = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
     \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
     \[
     \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

4. **Expressing the result as a percentage:**
   - To convert the ratio to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     2 \times 100 = 200\%
     \]

Therefore, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, but since the interest is compounded monthly and the payments are made at the end of the period, we can simply apply the interest rate for each month.

The formula to calculate the amount after each month is:
\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Total number of cards:**
   Adding up all the cards she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
   \]

Thus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher.
   - Total sentences edited per week = 1000
   - Sentences edited for each publisher = 1000 / 2 = 500

2. **Determine the payment rates:**
   - Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

3. **Calculate earnings from each publisher:**
   - Earnings from Publisher A = 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents
   - Earnings from Publisher B = 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

4. **Calculate total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B
   - Total earnings = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To calculate how much money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. **One-time monetary reward**: $5000

2. **Weekly salary before the raise**: $2000

3. **Annual salary before the raise**: 
   \[
   2000 \text{ (weekly salary)} \times 52 \text{ (weeks in a year)} = 104,000
   \]

4. **5% raise in salary**:
   \[
   2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \text{ (additional weekly salary)}
   \]
   \[
   2000 + 100 = 2100 \text{ (new weekly salary)}
   \]

5. **Annual salary after the raise**:
   \[
   2100 \times 52 = 109,200
   \]

6. **Total money made in the year**:
   \[
   109,200 \text{ (annual salary after raise)} + 5000 \text{ (one-time reward)} = 114,200
   \]

Therefore, John made $114,200 that year.

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down his cheese consumption by meal and then sum the totals.

1. **Lunch (sandwiches):**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Breakfast (omelets):**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Dinner (macaroni and cheese):**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum the total cheese used for all meals:

"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride = 125 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for four weeks = 125 kilometers/week * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers.

For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride = 120 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for three weeks = 120 kilometers/week * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers.

Adding the kilometers from both periods:
- Total kilometers = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum these weights.

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of the chocolate bars = 25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g.

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of the candied apples = 80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g.

3. **Total weight of the bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of the chocolate bars + weight of the candied apples
   - Total weight = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 plates * $6000/plate = $36000.

2. **Determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Total cost of 240 cups = $34800.
   - Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 cups = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white chickens than red chickens. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter and Gary's walking speed into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, which means:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]
3. The total number of customers by the end of the third day is 500. We need to find out how many customers were counted on the third day. Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( x \).

The total number of customers over the three days is the sum of the customers on each day:
\[
100 + 150 + x = 500
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
250 + x = 500
\]
\[
x = 500 - 250
\]
\[
x = 250
\]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's current age.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}

- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}

"First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces and then use that to find the total time required.

1. **Determine Kalinda's rate:**
   - Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine her mom's rate:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.
   - Therefore, her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

3. **Calculate their combined rate:**
   - Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate
   - Combined rate = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute

4. **Calculate the total time required to complete the puzzle:**
   - Total pieces to be placed = 360 pieces
   - Time required (in minutes) = Total pieces / Combined rate
   - Time required = \( \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \)

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited the farm. 

The farm produced 120 baby watermelons, and 30% of them were ready for harvest. 

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home. 

Next, we need to find out how many watermelons were left after her first visit:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, she harvested 63 more watermelons. 

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we subtract the number of watermelons harvested during the second visit from the remaining watermelons after the first visit:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information and setting up the equations.

1. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
3. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked each week.
2. Multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks to get the total hours over the entire movie.
3. Calculate the total cost before the discount.
4. Apply the 10% discount to find the final amount Jean paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours per week.
- The makeup artist works 6 hours each day.
- She works 4 days a week.
- Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours over the entire movie.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Total hours over 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost before the discount.
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Step 4: Apply the 10% discount.
- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.
- Final amount Jean paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Therefore, Jean paid $27,000.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- The number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree is \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) sections.
- Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \times 400 = 8000 \) pounds.

Next, determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate:
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \) pounds.

Finally, subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \) pounds.

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount needed for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the flour needed for today:**
   - Carla is making 36 cookies today.
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the number of cups needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for tomorrow:**
   - Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow.
   - Using the same proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total flour needed:**
   - Total flour needed = Flour needed for today + Flour needed for tomorrow

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Selling Price of the House**: $350,000
2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]
3. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the House**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

5. **Difference from Budget**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
   \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount he paid.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   - Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   - Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fees:**
   - Brokerage fees = 5% of $400,000
   - Brokerage fees = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   - Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fees
   - Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Total amount paid = Remaining loan amount + Total fees
   - Total amount paid = $250,000 + $32,000 = $282,000

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[
3S = 18
\]

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Now, we compare this total to Sam's target:
Target = 120 crates
Crates sold = 65 crates

Difference = Target - Crates sold = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the pages. Each piece of paper, when folded, creates four pages: two on the front and two on the back. 

In a 32-page tabloid:
- Page 1 is on the left back.
- Page 2 is on the left front.
- Page 32 is on the right back.
- Page 31 is on the right front.

This means that each piece of paper contains 4 pages. To find the total number of pieces of paper, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per piece of paper:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total loaves produced each day**: 60 loaves.
2. **Loaves sold in the morning**: Two-thirds of the total loaves.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. **Loaves left after the morning sales**: 
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. **Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening**: Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. **Loaves sold in the afternoon**: Since the 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, each period gets half of these 10 loaves.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 5.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy loses:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Sandy} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks required for Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over a period of fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and new legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculating the number of new arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated by dividing the total number of days by the interval at which new arms grow:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ new arms}
     \]

2. **Calculating the number of new legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated by dividing the total number of days by the interval at which new legs grow:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ new legs}
     \]

3. **Calculating the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ new arms} + 3 \text{ new legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
     \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, the serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all these expenses:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, and then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers × Salary of junior programmers.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge required:

100% - 60% = 40%

Next, we know the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, it will take:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the customer had $4 in rewards to use on their current shopping trip. 

Next, the customer used these rewards and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon value} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to the current shopping trip:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. Subtracting the total discount from the amount spent:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the customer paid:

"To determine which job offers Nick a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for the respective taxes.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Annual hours: 2000
- Annual gross pay: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Annual state tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Annual state tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts: the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge.

1. **Sugar for the suckers:**
   - Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
   - He wants to make 8 batches of suckers.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

2. **Sugar for the fudge:**
   - Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
   - He wants to make 1 batch of fudge.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

3. **Total sugar needed:**
   - Add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge: \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

Thus, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, which is 10 less than each of the other groups, will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The amount of stuffing for a collie bed is the average of these two amounts:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
   - According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

2. **Number of people kicked out for shoplifting:**
   - The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5.
   - Therefore, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \).
   - Substituting \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
     \]

3. **Number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale:**
   - The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.
   - Therefore, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

4. **Total number of people kicked out:**
   - The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons.
   - According to the problem, the total number of people kicked out is 50.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50
     \]

5. **Solving for \( y \):**
   - Combine the known values:
     \[
     31 + y = 50
     \]
   - Subtract 31 from both sides:
     \[
     y = 50 - 31 = 19
     \]

Thus, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \( 19 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total slices of pizza**: 12 slices.
2. **Slices given to Bill**: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12 slices = \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) slices.
3. **Slices given to Mark**: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 12 slices = \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) slices.
4. **Slices eaten by Jenny**: 2 slices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away and eaten:
- Slices given to Bill: 4 slices
- Slices given to Mark: 3 slices
- Slices eaten by Jenny: 2 slices

Total slices given away and eaten = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Number of millipedes**: She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. 
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Number of stink bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we add up all the bugs:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Number of spiders} + \text{Number of millipedes} + \text{Number of stink bugs}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

2. Convert the daily energy usage to kilowatts:
   - 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy usage in kilowatts = 7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day.

3. Calculate the reduced daily energy usage:
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day.
   - New usage time = 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours/day.
   - Reduced daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - Reduced daily energy usage in kilowatts = 2700 watts/day / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = Original daily energy usage - Reduced daily energy usage.
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = Daily energy savings * 30 days.
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people:
   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese needed. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese:
   \[
   \text{Total meat needed} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cheese needed} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:
   \[
   \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, Allan buys more cannolis and corns:
3. He buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he buys is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, let's find the new total number of corns:
5. The new total number of corns is \(80 + 60 = 140\).

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis:

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, let's break down the information provided:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps (5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
- Steps from walks to and from school: 5,000 steps
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000 steps

Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Since Elliott had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps, we can determine the number of steps he took during his jog by subtracting the steps he had left from his total goal:
- Total goal: 10,000 steps
- Steps left: 2,000 steps

Steps taken during the jog: 10,000 - 2,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
   - From the average trees: Let's denote this as \( x \) apples.

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both sisters:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 \)
   - Combined total: \( (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500 \)

Now, let's set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
150 + x = 500

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels.
2. Let \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
- The total number of humps is 304.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the equation \( D = 180 - C \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Homemade Bird Feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 homemade bird feeders.
   - Each homemade bird feeder attracts 20 birds plus an additional 10 birds.
   - Therefore, each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.
   - Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds.

2. **Store-Bought Bird Feeders:**
   - Lillian buys 3 store-bought bird feeders.
   - Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds.

3. **Total Birds:**
   - Total birds attracted by all feeders: \(90 + 60 = 150\) birds.

Thus, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over after buying the ticket. Therefore, he must have made a total of $150 from selling his cards.
2. Each card is sold for $1.5.
3. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he made by the price per card:
   \[
   \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100
   \]
4. Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards and sold the rest. If he sold 100 cards, these 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection (since he kept 1/3 and sold 2/3).
5. To find the total number of cards he started with, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total cards} = 100
   \]
6. Solving for the total number of cards:
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150
   \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would only have one hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for one hotdog) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26 / 2 = 13 guests.

"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount. 

1. The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
2. The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
3. The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is $132.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
   \[
   3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   Given that the area \(A\) is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil for Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
For one raised bed:
\[ \text{Volume} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds.
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Each bag costs $12.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total cost of the potting soil for Bob is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - If there are 15 red cards, then the number of green cards is:
     \[
     15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24
     \]

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is:
     \[
     15 + 24 = 39
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - The total number of cards is the sum of the red, green, and yellow cards.
   - Therefore, the total number of cards is:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 39 = 78
     \]

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is:

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible).

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the total amount he still needs to save. The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4, so the remaining amount is:

$12 - $4 = $8

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take him to save $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

So, it will take him 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without the coupon:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs is $4.00.

2. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - The total cost after the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Determine the total number of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - She buys 2 packs, so the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Calculate the cost per individual razor:**
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

5. **Convert the cost to cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is 25 cents.

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer and then convert the total height from inches to feet.

1. **Bottom Layer (4 girls):**
   - Each of the 4 girls is 64 inches tall.
   - Total height for the bottom layer: \( 4 \times 64 = 256 \) inches.

2. **Middle Layer (3 girls):**
   - Each of the 3 girls is 64 inches tall.
   - Total height for the middle layer: \( 3 \times 64 = 192 \) inches.

3. **Top Layer (2 girls):**
   - Each of the 2 girls is 64 inches tall.
   - Total height for the top layer: \( 2 \times 64 = 128 \) inches.

4. **Top Girl:**
   - The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   - Total height for the top girl: \( 60 \) inches.

Now, we add up the heights of all the layers:
\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we know David found 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that fraction into yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Next, we convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein into yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption cost.
2. Calculate the additional daily cost of the new device.
3. Determine the total daily cost after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.
5. Find the difference between the two weekly costs.

**Step 1: Calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption cost.**

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.

\[ \text{Current daily cost} = 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 18 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the additional daily cost of the new device.**

The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.

\[ \text{Additional daily cost} = 2 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total daily cost after adding the new device.**

\[ \text{Total daily cost after adding the device} = 18 \, \text{\$} + 3 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.**

\[ \text{Current weekly cost} = 18 \, \text{\$} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 126 \, \text{\$} \]
\[ \text{Weekly cost after adding the device} = 21 \, \text{\$} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 147 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 5: Find the difference between the two weekly costs.**

\[ \text{Difference} = 147 \, \text{\$} - 126 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$} \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person can paint a house.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.
2. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it takes one person to paint a whole house is:
   \[
   10 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 240 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. If one person takes 240 hours to paint a whole house, the rate of one person is:
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ house}}{240 \text{ hours}}
   \]
4. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is:
   \[
   5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{240 \text{ hours}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{240 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{48 \text{ hours}}
   \]
5. Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we can start by calculating the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week, and then add the extra hours from the weeks he worked out more.

1. If Josh worked out 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, the total would be:
   \( 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \)

2. However, he worked out 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, which is 1 hour extra per week for two weeks:
   \( 1 \text{ extra hour/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 2 \text{ extra hours} \)

3. Additionally, he worked out 6 hours in one week, which is 2 hours extra for that week:
   \( 2 \text{ extra hours} \)

Adding these extra hours to the base total:
\( 32 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ extra hours} + 2 \text{ extra hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \)

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. So, one-third of 21 is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:
\[
66

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25.

"To find the cost of one monitor, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors:
- Total cost of all items: $2,400
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700

The combined cost of the 2 monitors is:
$2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
$600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To determine how many vlogs Emma needs to complete to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

1. Vlogs made in the first week: 18
2. Vlogs made in the second week: 21
3. Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Next, we add these numbers together to find the total number of vlogs made so far:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs in a month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To calculate how much you ended up paying, we first need to determine the total amount including the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

So, the total amount including the tip is:
$50 + $10 = $60

Since you are splitting the check evenly but paying the entire tip, you pay half of the original bill plus the full tip:
Half of the original bill = $50 / 2 = $25

Therefore, the total amount you pay is:
$25 (half of the bill) + $10 (tip) = $35

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.**
   - Therefore, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \).
   - The total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   - Total savings in April = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 15x + 30x = 1125 \)
   - \( 45x = 1125 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April to meet his target.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount:

- Notebooks: 5 notebooks × $1.50 per notebook = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens × $0.25 per pen = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator × $12.00 per calculator = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set × $10.00 per geometry set = $10.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, so we calculate the discount amount:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 × $30.00 = $3.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the daily recommended amount of coffee:**
   - The daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups.

2. **Calculate how much coffee Octavia drinks:**
   - Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount.
   - Therefore, Octavia drinks \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) cups of coffee per day.

3. **Calculate how much coffee Juan drinks:**
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks.
   - Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) cups of coffee per day.

4. **Determine how much Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake:**
   - Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommended amount of 4 cups.
   - Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his intake by \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) cups.

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- Total pages read in two weeks = \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth, which totals:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, she received:
   \[
   0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
   \]
   Therefore, for the last two teeth, she received:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age.

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to earn.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants will have a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much more George needs to pay:**
   - George has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many hours George needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

- Quarters: 8 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels × 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies × 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Next, we add up all the amounts to find the total:

200 cents (quarters) + 60 cents (dimes) + 70 cents (nickels) + 15 cents (pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

345 cents ÷ 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ruiz's production rate:**
   - Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's production rate is \( \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

2. **Determine Marissa's production rate:**
   - Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

3. **Calculate the total production for 12 hours:**
   - Ruiz's production in 12 hours: \( 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Marissa's production in 12 hours: \( 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together:**
   - Total production = Ruiz's production + Marissa's production
   - Total production = 720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1800 pounds.

"To calculate Patrick's total earnings, we need to break down the sales into two periods and then sum the earnings from each period.

1. For the first four hours:
   - He sold 15 cups per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.50.
   - Total cups sold in four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
   - Earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.00.

2. For the next two hours:
   - He sold 10 cups per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.60.
   - Total cups sold in two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
   - Earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.00.

3. Total earnings:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from the first four hours + Earnings from the next two hours.
   - Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. 

First, find out how many 2-mile segments are in 400 miles:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments} \]

Next, calculate the total number of rotations in one month:
\[ 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in one year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach their maximum number of rotations.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years it will take to reach this limit:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. 

The bottle provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. Therefore, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get twice as many washes from the bottle:
\[ 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per wash. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents).

The cost per wash is:
\[ \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{240 \text{ washes}} = 10 \text{ cents per wash} \]

Since each wash uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is:
\[ 10 \text{ cents} \]

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we calculate the speed in kb per hour:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download 20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72,000 kb/hour.

Next, we convert kb per hour to Mb per hour:
- Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb.
- 72,000 kb/hour ÷ 1000 = 72 Mb/hour.

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cars towed over the week. 

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. So, the number of cars towed each day for the remaining four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. Adding the totals from the first three days and the remaining four days gives us the total number of cars towed for the week:
   \[
   30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, while Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to calculate the cost per class based on the number of classes he attends.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. The maximum acceptable cost per class is $10.
3. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6.
4. To find the maximum number of classes he can miss, we need to find the point at which the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny attends. The cost per class is then \( \frac{60}{x} \).

We set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10x \]
\[ x \geq 6 \]

This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at or below $10. 

Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we can calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required:
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we subtract the number of days required from the total number of days available to find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Total days available} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. **Initial cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly fuel cost**: Twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Hanger rental + Fuel cost
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost:
- Total cost = Initial cost + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
\[30 + 50 + 40 = 120\]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, we add these to the counts:
- **Good Days**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.
- **Neutral Days**: 10 (initial) + 1 (next three days) = 11 days.
- **Bad Days**: 8 (initial) + 0 (next three days) = 8 days.

Now, we need to determine how many good days are left in the month. Since the month has 30 days and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 initial + 3 next), we need to consider only the first 30 days.

The number of good days in the first 30 days is 12. Since the next three days include 2 good days, we need to subtract these from the total good days in the month:

- **Good Days Left in the Month**: 12 (initial) - 2 (next three days) = 10 days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we'll convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

The bamboo needs to grow to 600 inches. The current height is 240 inches, so the additional growth needed is:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the total additional growth needed by the daily growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 more toys to have one toy for each of the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, there are 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have one toy for each of the 24 dogs. Now he has 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs 3 toys, so he has 24 - 3 = 21 toys, which is exactly the number of dogs.

Therefore, James needs a total of 21 toys.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of the Cookie Monster's cookies, which we'll call \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
3. We know Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( C + 7 = 68 \). Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 61 \).
4. Now, we can find out how many cookies Max has: \( C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \) cookies.
5. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \( 73 + 23 = 96 \) cookies.
6. The total number of cookies is the sum of the cookies each person has: \( 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \).

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years.

First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 

To find out how many more coins Neil saves compared to Rong:
\[ \text{Additional coins Neil saves} = 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     T - 0.60T = 40
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     0.40T = 40
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.40:
     \[
     T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
     \]

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

"To calculate the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0 \) dollar.
   - The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is \( 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is \( 12 \times 0.5 = 6.0 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \( 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0 \) dollars.
   - The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is \( 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost of the crate:**
   - Sum the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = \( 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0 \) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is 32.0 dollars.

   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares**: The problem states there are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares**: The problem states there are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares**: The problem states there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   \[
   \text{White squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

     \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - The number of high chairs needed is 15, and the restaurant has 8 high chairs, so the number of additional high chairs needed is:
     \[
     15 - 8 = 7
     \]
   - The number of regular chairs needed is 42, and the restaurant has 40 regular chairs, so the number of additional regular chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 - 40 = 2
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of additional chairs needed:**
   - The total number of additional chairs needed is the sum of the additional high chairs and regular chairs:
     \[
     7 + 2 = 9
     \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27).

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 60 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 3 small stickers left, which are worth 3 small buttons.

   Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29
   Total small buttons = 60 + 3 = 63

6. **Final Total:**
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 29 + 63 = 92 buttons.

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 92.

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, we can find \( F \) by substituting \( A \) back into the first equation:
\[ F = 2A \]
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cases of shingles needed for each house. Let \( x \) be the number of cases needed for the first house. According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases. The third house needs double the first house, which is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Subtracting 5 miles per hour from this gives:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to determine the distance they drove. The total time for the trip was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 4.5 hours:

\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \]

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[

"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used per week.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.**

- One-way distance: 5 miles
- Round trip distance (to and from work): 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles
- Number of workdays in a week: 5 days

Total distance per week = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used per week.**

- Car fuel efficiency: 10 miles per gallon (MPG)

Fuel used per week = Total distance per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel used per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.**

- Price of gas: $3/gallon

Cost per week = Fuel used per week * Price of gas
Cost per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week for his commute.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( 2z \) for \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( z = 1 \) back to find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

The amount of oil is \( 2s \):
\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add these amounts together.

1. Calculate the total cost of the goats:
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

2. Calculate the total cost of the cows:
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

3. Add the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
   - Total amount spent = Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows = $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.

"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards each person has in terms of PJ's cards. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards. According to the problem:

- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( x = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3x = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it will take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at both math and English: The total number of students is 20. Subtracting those who are good at math only (5) and those who are good at English only (8) gives us the number of students who are good at both subjects: 20 - 5 - 8 = 7

Now, add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects:
5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

1. The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
2. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the time available for performances and transitions is:
   \[
   120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Each group requires:
   - 2 minutes to get on stage
   - 6 minutes to perform
   - 2 minutes to exit the stage
   This totals:
   \[
   2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes per group}
   \]

4. To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total available time by the time required per group:
   \[
   \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes per group}} = 11 \text{ groups}
   \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for (3 years).

First, calculate the annual interest rate as a decimal:
\[ r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \]

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

Next, add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
975"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts without collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Thus, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought in a year.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, we calculate the total number of pairs he buys in a year:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Baskets:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green baskets = 3 * $25 = $75.

2. **Cost of Red Baskets:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total cost for red baskets before discount = 3 * $18 = $54.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Total discount for red baskets = 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for red baskets after discount = $54 - $6 = $48.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for all baskets = Cost of green baskets + Cost of red baskets after discount.
   - Total cost = $75 + $48 = $123.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many rooms need to be cleaned. Since the task is to clean one-half of the 90 rooms:

\[ \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Next, we calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:

\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year. So, they will build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Doubling this amount gives \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we add up the homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built over the three years: \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\)

"Let's define the ages of the individuals involved:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- You are 3 years younger than your brother, so your age is \( B - 3 \).
- You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is \( (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3B - 1 \).

The sum of all your ages is given as 87:
\[ B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B + B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, calculate your age:
\[ B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial 10 people infected.

- **Day 0**: 10 people are initially infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Each of the 70 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Each of the 490 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade together and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many glasses the boys sold together by subtracting the number of glasses Julie sold from the total number of glasses sold:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie) = 18 glasses (boys)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2:

18 glasses (boys) ÷ 2 = 9 glasses (each boy)

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

14 glasses (Julie) - 9 glasses (Micah) = 5 glasses

"To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum these costs.

1. **Hair:** Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. **Manicure:** She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure as she did on her hair. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. **Pedicure:** She spent 3/4 as much on a pedicure as she did on a manicure.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of all the services:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the cost of buying a new rope with the money she has.
3. Calculate the leftover money after purchasing the new rope.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter.
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine the cost of buying a new rope.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. Sarah can buy a new rope of the same length (20 meters).
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate the leftover money.
Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah received from selling her old rope.
\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sarah will have 10 dollars left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract this from her budget of $65.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.
   - Cost of one pack of chicken = $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Total cost for 6 packs of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

5. **Total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
   - Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can break down the problem as follows:

- On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
- On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones are left without a space to fit in. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones arranged on the stage is 20.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of a whirligig based on the given information about the speeds of a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit.

1. Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second.
2. According to the problem, a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \) meters per second.
3. We are given that the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   11T = 121
   \]
4. Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
5. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of times she mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) represents the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 for all her work, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem does not specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9J \times 6 = 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

Thus, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

2. **Calculate the total pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.
   - Total pieces of bologna for red balloons = \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) pieces.

3. **Determine the remaining pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - Total pieces of bologna thrown = 58 pieces.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 40 pieces.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons = \( 58 - 40 = 18 \) pieces.

4. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Total pieces of bologna for yellow balloons = \( 3y \).
   - We know \( 3y = 18 \).

5. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - \( y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first calculate the total number of miles he drives in that period.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals are in 3000 miles:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they had the same amount of allowance.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: 1 dozen (12 balloons) at $0.5 for 2 balloons. 
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total cost by 2:
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and John as follows:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( A \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be John's age.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than John:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( A \) and \( P \):
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

Step 3: Calculate the amount he recovers from selling 5 CDs.
\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Step 4: Subtract the amount recovered from the total cost after the discount.
\[ \text{Net amount out} = \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that James actually made a profit of \$110. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this case is \$0 because he did not lose any money.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we need to multiply the number of each type of crop by its respective price and then sum the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.0

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.0

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.0

Now, we add the earnings from each type of crop:
$9.0 + $20.0 + $5.0 = $34.0

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.0 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time for the initial swim: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swim time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - The total distance is 20 miles, and he has already swum 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time for the remaining swim:**
   - Time for the remaining swim: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Initial swim time + Rest time + Remaining swim time
   - Total time: \( 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \) hours.

The total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - Total commission from 6 copies = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - Total commission from 10 copies = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, Cayley's total commission is $15.00.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two more equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the expressions for \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

First, we calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply by the thickness of the book in inches:

\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Pages per inch} \times \text{Thickness in inches} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \times 1.5 \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contains 2 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

1. Calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

2. Determine Vince's stapling rate:
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   - Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   - Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. 

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. 

To find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan initially has:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks**: 
   - Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted over 2 weeks
   - Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

4. **Unoccupied Beds**:
   - Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
   - Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day.
3. Use the information that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day. The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of Pokémon each person has caught with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon: \( A + S + W = 339 \).
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( A = S + 5 \).
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught: \( S = 4W - 13 \).

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( W = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4W - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south: \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \).

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total number of ""kid-sized"" slices the watermelon is divided into. If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as a kid's slice, we can consider each adult's slice as equivalent to 2 kid-sized slices.

- Each adult gets 2 kid-sized slices.
- There are 2 adults, so the adults together get \(2 \times 2 = 4\) kid-sized slices.
- There are 4 kids, so the kids together get \(4 \times 1 = 4\) kid-sized slices.

The total number of kid-sized slices is \(4 + 4 = 8\).

Since the watermelon is divided into 8 equal parts (in terms of kid-sized slices), each part represents \(\frac{1}{8}\) of the watermelon.

Each adult gets 2 of these parts, so each adult gets:
\[
2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} = 25\%

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

The cost to fill the pool is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x - 0.07 \times 3x = x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that after these 3 hours, the charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.79x = 28 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y - 0.09 \times 5y = y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that after these 5 hours, the charge is 35.44%.
   - Therefore, \( 0.55y = 35.44 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{35.44}{0.55} \approx 64.44\%
     \]

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.44%.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

1. **Cost of peaches**: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
2. **Cost of pears**: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
3. **Cost of kiwis**: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
4. **Cost of apples**: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Next, we add up these costs to find the total amount spent so far:
\[ 1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25 \]

Jamaar started with $10.00, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[ 10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75 \]

Each plum costs $0.25, so the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
\[ 0.75 / 0.25 = 3 \]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two sub-scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
       - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
       - Therefore, the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
     - Total probability = 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

"To determine how long it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time it takes for Richard to move from the first bottle to the last bottle, dropping the candy in each bottle.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard places a bottle every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total time to move from the first bottle to the last bottle.**

Richard starts at the first bottle and moves to the next bottle, which takes 5 seconds. Since there are 8 bottles, he will move from one bottle to the next 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

The total time to move from the first bottle to the last bottle is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To determine how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has.
2. Determine how many packs can be made with the total number of apples.

First, we know that each box contains 40 apples and Uncle Franky ordered 2 boxes. Therefore, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 apples each can be made from 80 apples. This is done by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including both the loans and the income he lost by not working. Then, we'll determine how long it will take him to earn this amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - **Loans:** Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
     \[
     50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
     \]
   - **Lost income:** Jim could have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
     \[
     25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
     \]
   - **Total cost:**
     \[
     200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
     \]

2. **Calculate Jim's new income:**
   - Before college, Jim earned $25,000 per year.
   - After college, his income is tripled.
     \[
     25,000 \times 3 = 75,000
     \]

3. **Determine the net increase in income per year:**
   - New income: $75,000
   - Old income: $25,000
   - Net increase:
     \[
     75,000 - 25,000 = 50,000
     \]

4. **Calculate the time needed to earn the total cost:**
   - Total cost: $300,000
   - Net increase in income per year: $50,000
   - Time required:
     \[
     \frac{300,000}{50,000} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
80 square feet (area of one piece) * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.
2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's letters: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's letters: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

Now, we sum the letters delivered over the three days:
- Monday: 425
- Tuesday: 102
- Wednesday: 209

Total letters delivered: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for this calculation.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \). According to the problem, the second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars, and the third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the fraction of a day they worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by all painters.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

First, calculate the total number of days:
- 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Next, determine the fraction of a day they worked each day:
- They worked 3/8 of a day each day.

Convert the fraction of a day to hours:
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 3/8 of a day = (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours

Calculate the total hours worked by all painters:
- Total hours per day for all painters = 9 hours
- Total hours for 21 days = 9 * 21 = 189 hours

Finally, divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked:
- Number of painters = 4
- Hours per painter = 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ V = P (1 - r)^n \]
where:
- \( V \) is the value after \( n \) years,
- \( P \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( n = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ V = 20000 (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 (0.79)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ V \approx 9860.78 \]

The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( D \) represent the number of minutes Donovan's part took. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as \( D + 18 \).

The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify and solve for \( D \):
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of mailing both the small and big coupons.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost of mailing all the coupons is the sum of the costs for the small and big coupons:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[
245

"To determine how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to calculate the amount each spent and then subtract that from their initial amounts.

First, let's calculate how much Maggie spent:
Maggie spent a quarter of her money. Since she had $60:
\[ \text{Amount Maggie spent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, the amount Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Riza spent:
Riza spent one-third of her money. Since she also had $60:
\[ \text{Amount Riza spent} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, the amount Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, we add the amounts left for both Maggie and Riza:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they have left is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate is half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. This means that the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

Thus, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken can from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas:
- 3 shaken
- 9 unshaken

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, leaving:
- 3 shaken
- 8 unshaken

Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving:
- 2 shaken
- 6 unshaken

Now, there are 8 sodas left in total. The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add these distances together to find the total distance between them.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \)

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \)

3. To find the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we add the distances each train has traveled:
   \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \)

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of days worked * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. According to the problem, Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 × Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 × 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Next, we add the distances run by Amber and Micah to find the total distance they both ran:

Total distance run by Amber and Micah = Amber's distance + Micah's distance
Total distance run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28
Total distance run by Amber and Micah = 36 miles

The total distance run by all three is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - Total distance run by Amber and Micah
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To determine Sheila's new credit card balance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the discounted price of the frying pan:
   - The original price of the frying pan is $20.00.
   - The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00.
   - The discounted price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Calculate the discounted price of the set of towels:
   - The original price of the set of towels is $30.00.
   - The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00.
   - The discounted price of the set of towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. 

First, let's set up the equation to find the total number of students (T):

40% of T = 240 boys
0.40 * T = 240

To solve for T, divide both sides by 0.40:

T = 240 / 0.40
T = 600

Now, if the total number of students is 600 and 240 of them are boys, the number of girls (G) can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

G = T - 240
G = 600 - 240
G = 360

So, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and the total miles she plans to hike daily.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes 125 miles twice a day, she will hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The additional miles she needs to hike are:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.
2. Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.
3. Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.
4. Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.

- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Total toys produced by the first 4 workers:
  \[
  120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.

- The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys:
  \[
  400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift is 380 toys.

### Step 3: Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.

- Total toys produced by the fifth worker:
  \[
  380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.

- The fifth worker produced 180 toys in 10 hours:
  \[
  \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
  \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means that two years ago, Vince was 7 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs Painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - Therefore, \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).

3. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - \( 2S + 12 = 30 \)
   - \( 2S = 18 \)
   - \( S = 9 \)

4. **Eggs Painted by Camden:**
   - Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

5. **Eggs Painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

6. **Total Eggs Painted by All:**
   - The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.
   - Therefore, \( 2A + 30 = 56 \).

7. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - \( 2A = 26 \)
   - \( A = 13 \)

8. **Difference in Eggs Painted by Camden and Arnold:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

So, Grandma's speed on the beach is 1 mile per 20 minutes.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. We know that her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. 

\[ \text{Amount saved so far} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60.

\[ \text{Amount needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28.

\[ \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the current number of marbles:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his current number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

1. **Determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed to make a certain number of scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
   - \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

   So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

"To determine Linus's total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each device and then sum the profits from all the devices he bought and sold.

1. **Cost Price (CP) of one device**: $20
2. **Selling Price (SP) of one device**: $20 * 2 = $40
3. **Profit from one device**: SP - CP = $40 - $20 = $20

Next, we calculate the total profit from the devices bought on each day:

- **Devices bought on Monday**: 2
  - **Total profit from Monday**: 2 * $20 = $40

- **Devices bought on Tuesday**: 4
  - **Total profit from Tuesday**: 4 * $20 = $80

Finally, we sum the profits from both days to get the total profit:

- **Total profit**: $40 + $80 = $120

Thus, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy needs, 5 bottles are required (since 100% / 20% = 5 bottles).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

2. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes each have 200 apartments. Combined, they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ additional apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**

Adding the apartments from all three complexes:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.

"Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as \( R \), \( B \), and \( Y \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation.

From \( B = Y - 7 \), we can express \( R \) as:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28 \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, find \( B \) using \( B = Y - 7 \):
\[ B = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, find \( R \) using \( R = 4B \):
\[ R = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Amount Left in Ronnie's Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, calculate the amount of yellow paint:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is:
  \[
  \frac{12 \text{ pints}}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
  \]

Next, calculate the amount of paint used for the other three colors (red, white, and purple):
- The remaining half of the mural is 6 pints, which is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
- Therefore, the amount of paint for each of these colors is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many cycles can be run for $1.

1. First, calculate the number of pods in the special size box:
   - A regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. Next, determine the cost per pod in the special size box:
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. Finally, calculate how many cycles can be run for $1:
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.
   - Since each pod runs one cycle, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the second equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 3(C + 25) \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( W = 3(C + 25) \)

Since both expressions equal \( W \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 5(C + 7) = 3(C + 25) \]

Expanding both sides:
\[ 5C + 35 = 3C + 75 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 2C + 35 = 75 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 2C = 40 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her friends and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Total cheese slices consumed = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Total pepperoni slices consumed = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas:
- Total number of pizzas needed = 3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of Making Snowballs**: Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour.
2. **Rate of Melting Snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation**: 
   - Snowballs made per hour: 20
   - Snowballs melted per hour: 8
   - Net snowballs per hour: 20 - 8 = 12

4. **Time to Accumulate 60 Snowballs**:
   - We need to find the time \( t \) in hours such that the net accumulation of snowballs is 60.
   - Using the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour, we set up the equation:
     \[
     12t = 60
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

4. **End of the Third Day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days and then determine the initial number of bandages.

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

- **Net change in bandages:**
  - Total ordered - Total used = \(150 - 91 = 59\) bandages.

- **Bandages at the end of the third day:**
  - They had 78 bandages left.

- **Initial number of bandages:**
  - Let \(x\) be the initial number of bandages.
  - After the net change, they had \(x + 59\) bandages.
  - At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages.
  - Therefore, \(x + 59 = 78\).

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair removed is \(10 - 8 = 2\) inches.
   - The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Therefore, the cost for 2 inches is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the hair color:**
   - The cost of the hair color is a flat rate of $40.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the haircut cost and the hair color cost: \(60 + 40 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of May's cut and color is $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, calculate her weekly earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, which totals:
  \( 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \)

- Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
  \( 45 \text{ hours/week} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 67.5 \text{ dollars/week} \)

Next, calculate her monthly earnings from her hourly wage:
- There are 4 weeks in April, so her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
  \( 67.5 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 270 \text{ dollars} \)

Now, add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week, and there are 4 weeks in April, so her total attendance bonus is:
  \( 10 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 40 \text{ dollars} \)

Finally, add her monthly earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus:
- Total earnings for April:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
- Base area = 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches
- Height = 15 inches

Volume of the jar = Base area * Height = 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
Total number of jelly beans = Effective volume / Volume per jelly bean = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
Difference = |900 - 864| = 36

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation to represent the total length:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There is a flashlight for every person in the house.
   - There are 4 people.
   - Therefore, there are 4 flashlights for the people.
   - There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Therefore, there are \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) flashlights for the rooms.
   - Total flashlights: \( 4 + 16 = 20 \).

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each.
   - Half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each.
   - Half of 8 rooms is \( 8 / 2 = 4 \) rooms.
   - Therefore, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) small candles.
   - The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) medium candles.
   - Total candles: \( 16 + 20 = 36 \).

3. **Total items:**
   - Total flashlights: 20
   - Total candles: 36

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed.**

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
   - Daily consumption for one pig = 4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day.

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   - Daily consumption for five pigs = 8 pounds/day/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day.

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   - Weekly consumption = 40 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week.

4. **Determine the amount of feed left after a week:**
   - Initial amount of feed = 300 pounds.
   - Feed consumed in a week = 280 pounds.
   - Feed left = 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

So, the amount of feed left after a week is:

20 pounds."

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the total profit:**
   The profit is 25% of the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   The total selling price is the total cost plus the profit.
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   Divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2
   \]

Each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - James is currently 18 years old.
   - Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - John is currently 37 years old.
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes per orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes per orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Difference = Number of oranges Ana can peel - Number of oranges Jane can peel
   - Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To determine the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

1. **Cost of the radiator after the discount:**
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Discount amount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Cost after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of the mechanic's labor:**
   - Mechanic's rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator after discount + Total labor cost
   - Total cost = \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

230"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To determine how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices.
