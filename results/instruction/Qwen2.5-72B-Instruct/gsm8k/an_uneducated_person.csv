"To figure this out, let's break it down. A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also takes half that much white fiber. Half of 2 is 1. So, it takes 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, to find the total bolts, we add the blue and white bolts together:
2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

So, the total number of bolts it takes is 3.

"To figure out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. The original value of the house was $80,000. 

150% of $80,000 is calculated as:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the value of the house increased by $120,000. 

The new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, the profit is the new value minus the total cost:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]

"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, for each session, he runs:

3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

He does this 3 times a week, so in a week he runs:

180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

"To figure out how much feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to first find out how much feed the chickens need in total for the day and then subtract what they've already been given.

Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day. Wendi has 20 chickens, so:
3 cups/chicken/day * 20 chickens = 60 cups/day

Wendi has already given the chickens:
15 cups in the morning + 25 cups in the afternoon = 40 cups

So, for the final meal, Wendi needs to give:
60 cups/day - 40 cups already given = 20 cups

"Okay, let's figure this out. If one glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, that means every second glass costs $3. So, for every two glasses, Kylar pays $5 for the first and $3 for the second, which totals $8 for two glasses.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying. That's 16 / 2 = 8 pairs.

Now, if each pair costs $8, then for 8 pairs, Kylar will pay 8 * $8 = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so:
Charleston = 4 * 20 = 80 sheep

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:
Toulouse = 2 * 80 = 160 sheep

Now, we add up the sheep from all three places:
Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep

So, the total number of sheep is 260.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to figure out how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart.
   - 40% of 200 GB is 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB.

2. Next, we calculate how long it takes to download 80 GB.
   - At 2 GB/minute, it takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

3. After the download is interrupted, the computer restarts, which takes 20 minutes.

4. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, she needs to download the full 200 GB again.
   - At 2 GB/minute, it takes 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

5. Now, we add up all the time:
   - Time to download 80 GB: 40 minutes
   - Time for the restart: 20 minutes
   - Time to download the full 200 GB: 100 minutes

   Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance he covers is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

Now, he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. Here's what happens during those 4 hours:

1. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
2. He spends the next half-hour driving at 30 mph:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \]
3. He spends the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours) driving at 80 mph:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance he covers on his way back is:
\[ 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles} \]

Since he was 180 miles away from home initially, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

"To figure out Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. First, calculate the pay for the regular 40 hours:
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Next, calculate the pay for the 5 hours of overtime:
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. Finally, add the regular pay and the overtime pay to get the total earnings:
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
2. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, so that's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.
3. In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. So, 30% of 180 is 0.30 * 180 = 54. The downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, to find the total downloads over the three months, we add up the downloads from each month:
60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then add them together.

1. For the donuts:
   - She bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, the cost for the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

2. For the mini cupcakes:
   - She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

3. For the mini cheesecakes:
   - She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

"To figure out when Carlos starts earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the total costs and the total earnings over the years.

1. **Initial Cost to Plant the Tree:** $90
2. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed the Tree:** $3
3. **Annual Earnings from Selling Lemons:** 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Each year, the net profit (earnings minus costs) is:
$10.5 (earnings) - $3 (costs) = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial planting cost:
$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net profit per year) = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling some at the orange house.
2. Before the orange house, she had twice as many because she sold half of what was left there. So, before the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house than she did at the green house. Let's say she sold x vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold x + 2 at the red house.
4. After selling at the green and red houses, she had 10 vacuum cleaners left. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is the total she started with minus 10.
5. The total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x (green) + (x + 2) (red) = 2x + 2.
6. The total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is 10 (left after red house) + 2x + 2 (sold at green and red houses).
7. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so x = 1/3 of the total she started with.
8. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with T. So, x = T/3.
9. Substituting x in the equation for the total number of vacuum cleaners, we get T = 10 + 2(T/3) + 2.
10. Simplifying, T = 10 + 2T/3 + 2.
11. Combining like terms, T - 2T/3 = 12.
12. Simplifying further, 3T/3 - 2T/3 = 12, which gives T/3 = 12.
13. Therefore, T = 12 * 3 = 36.

"First, let's figure out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, that's 20% of 20, which is 4 students.

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left.

Next, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. So, 25% of 16 is 4 students.

This leaves us with 16 - 4 = 12 students who enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we take the number of students in hip-hop (12) and divide it by the total number of students (20), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To figure out which option gives the merchant more profit, we need to calculate the profit from each option.

For the jewelry:
- The initial cost is $5,000.
- The market is expected to go up by 2.5%.
- The profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets:
- The initial cost is $8,000.
- The market is expected to go up by 1.2%.
- The profit from electronic gadgets = $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96.

Comparing the two, the profit from jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from electronic gadgets ($96).

So, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit, and the profit would be $125.

"To figure out Jill's annual salary, we need to break it down into her earnings from teaching and her earnings from cheerleading coaching.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- So, her weekly earnings from teaching are 35 hours * $20/hour = $700.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from cheerleading coaching:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- So, her weekly earnings from coaching are 15 hours * $30/hour = $450.

Now, let's add her weekly earnings from both jobs:
- Her total weekly earnings are $700 (teaching) + $450 (coaching) = $1150.

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary is:
- 50 weeks * $1150/week = $57,500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

"Okay, let's break this down. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses 3 eggs times 7 days, which is 21 eggs. For 4 weeks, you multiply 21 eggs by 4, which gives you 84 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, you divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens that is. 84 divided by 12 is 7.

"Okay, let's break this down. Marissa has already walked 4 miles in the first hour and then 2 more miles in the next hour. So, she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The trail is 12 miles long, so she has 6 miles left to walk. 

To find out what speed she needs to walk the remaining distance to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we need to figure out the total time she should take to complete the 12 miles. 

If her average speed needs to be 4 miles per hour, then the total time to complete 12 miles is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

She has already taken 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles. 

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since it's two-thirds water:
- Water in orange drink = 10 liters * (2/3) = 20/3 liters = 6.67 liters

Next, we need to figure out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water:
- Water in pineapple drink = 15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters

Now, you spill 1 liter of the orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter is:
- Water in spilled orange drink = 1 liter * (2/3) = 2/3 liters = 0.67 liters

So, the remaining water in the 9 liters of orange drink (after spilling 1 liter) is:
- Remaining water in orange drink = 6.67 liters - 0.67 liters = 6 liters

Now, we add the remaining 9 liters of orange drink to the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- Total water in the mixture = 6 liters (from orange drink) + 9 liters (from pineapple drink) = 15 liters

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:
15 liters

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Samantha is 31 years old now.
2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old now.
3. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old.
4. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 37 - 23 = 14.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"Okay, let's break it down. Billy had 8 customers. The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's 3 DVDs. The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's 4 DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs. 

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:
3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the original price of the book, you need to figure out what 100% would be when 75% (100% - 25%) is $19.50. 

You can set up the equation like this:
\[ 0.75 \times \text{original price} = 19.50 \]

To solve for the original price, divide both sides by 0.75:
\[ \text{original price} = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, do the division:
\[ \text{original price} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"First, let's figure out how much Marie spent on the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

The chicken meal costs $12.
The 5 packs of milk cost 5 * $3 = $15.
The 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes Marie ordered is:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

For the shoes:
3 pairs × $42.00 per pair = $126.00

Now, we add the costs together:

Now, add the cost of both pairs of high heels together:
$33 + $66 = $99

The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if the high heels cost $99, the boots must cost $99 + $5.

$99 + $5 = $104

So, the boots cost $104.

"To figure out Darrell and Allen's ages, we first need to understand the ratio and the total age. The ratio of their ages is 7:11, which means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen has 11 parts. Together, these parts add up to 162.

First, let's find out how many parts there are in total:
7 parts (Darrell) + 11 parts (Allen) = 18 parts

Now, we know that these 18 parts equal 162 years. So, each part is:
162 years / 18 parts = 9 years per part

Next, we calculate Allen's current age:
11 parts * 9 years per part = 99 years

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 years to his current age:
99 years + 10 years = 109 years

3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses:

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses:
240 / 3 = 80

So, the average guess is 80.

"Let's figure this out step by step. If we say the number of silver coins is S, then the number of gold coins would be S + 30, because there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. The total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation:

S + (S + 30) = 110

This simplifies to:

2S + 30 = 110

Now, we subtract 30 from both sides:

2S = 80

Then we divide both sides by 2:

S = 40

So, there are 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:

40 + 30 = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To figure out how fast John runs, we need to find out how many miles he runs per hour, which is his speed.

First, let's find out how many hours he runs each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so that's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.
- So, for the other two days combined, he runs 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours he runs in a week:
- Total hours = 3 (first day) + 3 (other two days) = 6 hours.

John runs 60 miles a week in 6 hours. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours:
- Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"First, let's figure out Dana's speeds for running and walking.

If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and skipping is half as fast as running, then running must be twice as fast as skipping. So, Dana's running speed is:
3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is:
6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, let's figure out how much time she spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running:
6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours

Time spent walking:
6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles

Distance walking:
4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles

Total distance traveled:

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume:
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- So, you can still consume 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

Now, we need to figure out how many grams of chips you can eat with those 200 calories:
- The bag is 300 grams and has 1250 calories.
- So, 1 gram of chips has 1250 calories / 300 grams = 4.1667 calories/gram.

Finally, to find out how many grams you can eat with 200 calories:
- 200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram = 48 grams.

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To figure out Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax

Step 2: The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Step 3: The revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each is:
20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Step 4: The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

So, Charlie's net profit is $20.00.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - Each article takes 4 hours.
   - Total hours on Monday = 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = 5 articles + (2/5 * 5 articles) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
   - Total hours on Tuesday = 7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = 2 * 7 articles = 14 articles.
   - Total hours on Wednesday = 14 articles * 4 hours/article = 56 hours.

4. **Total hours over the three days:**
   - Total hours = 20 hours (Monday) + 28 hours (Tuesday) + 56 hours (Wednesday) = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to figure out how many she used and how many she started with.

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. After placing the Post-it notes on the cups, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them:

Total Post-it notes = Post-it notes she started with + Post-it notes in the package
Total Post-it notes = 80 + (number of Post-it notes in the package)

We also know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 left:

Total Post-it notes - 220 = 23

Now we can set up the equation:

80 + (number of Post-it notes in the package) - 220 = 23

Solving for the number of Post-it notes in the package:

(number of Post-it notes in the package) = 23 + 220 - 80
(number of Post-it notes in the package) = 163

So, the package contained 163 Post-it notes.

"First, let's figure out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

$200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys:

2 * 5 = 10 red ties

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is:

$40 + (0.5 * $40) = $40 + $20 = $60

Now, to find out how much he spent on the red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:

10 * $60 = $600

To find the total amount spent on all ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

$200 + $600 = $800

"To figure out how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can get from a 4-foot wire, first, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is 4 times 12, which is 48 inches. Now, if we take the 48 inches and divide it by 6 inches (the length of each piece), we get 48 divided by 6, which equals 8. So, Tracy can get 8 pieces of wire.

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ units} = 90 \text{ units} \]

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

"First, let's figure out how much weight Uriah removes by taking out 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so 30 comic books weigh:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. He has already removed 7.5 pounds with the comic books, so he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys he needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the weight he still needs to remove by the weight of each toy:

7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound per toy = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"Let's break it down:

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The charge for each truck tire is $60, and for each car tire, it's $40. So, the total revenue for Thursday is:
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60 = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40 = $160
- Total for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic only repaired 12 car tires. The charge for each car tire is $40. So, the total revenue for Friday is:
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40 = $480

Now, to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue:
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480
- Difference: $520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday.

"To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to figure out how much weight is left for the boxes after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge can carry 5000 pounds. The driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds. So, the weight available for the boxes is:

5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the available weight by the weight of one box:

1245 pounds / 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

Next, for the second half of the year, the company charges her 10% less. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $140:

\[ 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \]

So, the new monthly charge for the second half of the year is:

\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount she pays for the second half of the year, which is also 6 months:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Finally, we add the amounts for both halves of the year to get the total amount she paid by the end of the year:

Now, we need to find her annual salary after 3 more years (8 years total). Since there are no further increases mentioned, her monthly salary remains $660.

To find her annual salary, multiply her monthly salary by 12:
$660 * 12 = $7,920

So, Sylvie's annual salary after 8 years of service is $7,920.

"Okay, let's think about this. If Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can say that for every copy Harald sold, Marilyn sold 10. So, if we add Harald's copies and Marilyn's copies together, it's like adding 1 part Harald and 10 parts Marilyn, which makes 11 parts in total.

Now, we know that these 11 parts equal 88,000 copies. To find out how many copies one part (Harald's sales) is, we divide 88,000 by 11.

88,000 divided by 11 is 8,000.

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"First, we need to figure out how many gift bags Christina actually needs. Since 1/4 of the people don't show up, that means 3/4 of the people do show up. So, 3/4 of 16 friends is 12 friends who will show up. 

Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest, so for 12 guests, she needs:
12 guests * .75 gift bags/guest = 9 gift bags

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
9 gift bags * $2/gift bag = $18

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted needs, we first need to calculate how much the adults and the children will eat.

Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad. There are 20 adults, so:
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 5 lbs of potato salad. There are 5 children, so:
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the amount for the adults and the children together:
200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

So, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2, which is 6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6, which is 18 pets. Now, to find the total number of pets, we add Cindy's, Marcia's, and Jan's pets together: 4 + 6 + 18.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. James is 10 years old.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Before Gerald changed his diet, Lee was 2 seconds faster than Gerald. So, Gerald's original time was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
3. Gerald improved his speed by 10%. This means his new time is 90% of his original time.

To find Gerald's new time:
40 seconds * 0.90 = 36 seconds

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know there are 60 dogs. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the number of rabbits. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = (\text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats}) - 12 \]
\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, we add up all the pets to get the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} \]
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:

"First, let's find out how many boys there are. There are 200 students in total, and 2/5 of them are boys. So, we calculate:

200 * 2/5 = 80 boys

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

200 - 80 = 120 girls

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:

120 * 2/3 = 80 girls in the girl scout

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

120 - 80 = 40 girls not in the girl scout

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how long James slept. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. Harry slept 9 hours, so we multiply 9 by 2/3 to find out how long James slept.

9 * (2/3) = 6 hours

James slept 6 hours. Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

9 - 6 = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To figure out how many tomatoes Freda used, let's break it down step by step.

1. Freda’s sauce ends up at 32 ounces after cooking.
2. The sauce loses half its volume when cooked, so before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes was 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.
3. Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces and contains 3 tomatoes.
4. To get 64 ounces of tomatoes, Freda would need 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
5. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, 4 cans would contain 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To figure out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, let's break down the information:

1. Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and didn't drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The total number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam is 5 (the ones that took the exit).

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is the sum of the cars that drove through and the cars that took the exit:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[

"First, let's add up all the pages Solo has to read:

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Solo read 15 pages on Monday, so we subtract that from the total:

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading, so we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To find the inner volume of one box, we first need to subtract the thickness of the walls from each dimension. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Width: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
4 inches * 3 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
24 cubic inches * 3 = 72 cubic inches

So far, without Wednesday, he watched 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

He watched 7 hours in total, so on Wednesday, he watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, he watched 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we need to calculate the total area of the roll-ups each of them had and then find the average of those areas.

First, let's calculate the area of Beatrice's roll-up:
- Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Area of Beatrice's roll-up = 2 * 24 = 48 square roll-ups.

Next, let's calculate the area of Marcell's roll-up:
- Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Area of Marcell's roll-up = 3 * 14 = 42 square roll-ups.

Now, let's find the total area of both roll-ups:
- Total area = 48 + 42 = 90 square roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total area by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average area = 90 / 2 = 45 square roll-ups.

So, on average, they ate 45 square roll-ups.

64 seconds / 16 seconds = 4 intervals

So, she rowed 4 intervals of 20 feet each:

4 intervals * 20 feet = 80 feet

Now, for every 10 feet she rowed, the boat took on 2 liters of water. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water the boat took on is:

80 feet / 10 feet = 8
8 * 2 liters = 16 liters

So, the boat took on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

"First, let's figure out how much Sasha originally paid for all the lumber.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Total cost for all the lumber:
$100 + $80 = $180

Now, let's calculate the new selling price for each type of board after the 50% price increase.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
Original price: $10
50% increase: $10 * 0.50 = $5
New price: $10 + $5 = $15

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
Original price: $16
50% increase: $16 * 0.50 = $8
New price: $16 + $8 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Total revenue from selling all the boards:
$150 + $120 = $270

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

First, we find out how many 20-part groups are in 120:
120 / 20 = 6

Since each 20-part group contains 7 parts of sugar, we multiply the number of groups by 7 to find the total amount of sugar:

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"First, let's figure out what Lylah was earning four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien was earning $40,000, we can set up the equation:

\[ 40,000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

To find Lylah's salary, we divide both sides by 1.30:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \approx 30,769.23 \]

Next, we need to find out what Adrien's salary is now, four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find out what 40% more than Lylah's original salary is:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 \approx 43,076.92 \]

Now, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they are receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 \approx 99,076.92 \]

First, we need to find out how many video games Brian actually has after losing 5. Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:
20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we first calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:
3 * 15 = 45.

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:
45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

"First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

27 / 3 = 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

9 * (2/3) = 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies before any extra fees.

The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is:
2 * $7.50 = $15.00

The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is:
2 * $1.50 = $3.00

The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is:
2 * $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add these costs together to get the total before the delivery fee and tip:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. 20% of $20.00 is:
0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

So, the total with the delivery fee is:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
$29.00

"First, let's figure out how many questions Mark could complete in the time he had for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, in 8 hours, he could complete 8 * 5 = 40 questions.

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
- 75 - 40 = 35 questions.

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, in 6 hours, he could complete 6 * 5 = 30 questions.

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
- 100 - 30 = 70 questions.

Now, to find the total number of questions he left incomplete from both tests:
- 35 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 105 questions.

"Okay, let's figure this out. If there are 12 blue gumballs, and the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs, we can set up the problem like this:

Number of pink gumballs = 4 * (number of blue gumballs) + 22

So, we plug in the number of blue gumballs:

Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22

Now, let's do the math:

4 * 12 = 48
48 + 22 = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find out the percentage of semi-automatic cars, first, we need to figure out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
( Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars ) * 100

So, (4 / 20) * 100 = 20%

20%"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of queens is \( Q \).
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we know the number of worker bees is \( 4Q \):
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. If he spent this time working instead, he would work an extra 2 hours each day. Since he earns $10 an hour, let's calculate how much he would earn in one week.

First, find out how many extra hours he would work in a week:
2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Now, calculate how much he would earn for these extra hours:
14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn $140 in one week.

"Okay, let's break this down. John buys:

- Milk for $2 (food)
- Eggs for $3 (food)
- Light bulbs for $3 (nonfood)
- Cups for $3 (nonfood)
- Roach traps for $4 (nonfood)

First, we add up the cost of the food items:
$2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5

Next, we add up the cost of the nonfood items:
$3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the nonfood items:
10% of $10 = $1

So, the total cost of the nonfood items with tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items with tax:
$5 (food) + $11 (nonfood with tax) = $16

The total cost is:

"First, let's figure out the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is confident about getting 5 more, so:

3 + 5 = 8 clients

Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost for the bleach and cloths for one client is:

2 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle + 1 pack of cloths * $5 per pack
= $4 + $5
= $9

Now, for 8 clients, the total cost will be:

8 clients * $9 per client
= $72

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

$92 - $72 = $20

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees half that many bees return. So, 30 / 2 = 15 bees return.
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. The bees that left and didn't return are the 60 bees that left in the third 6-hour period minus the 15 bees that returned in the second 6-hour period. So, 60 - 15 = 45 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in their times is the waiting time for the winner.

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so to find out how much change he gets, we subtract the total cost from $10:

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. After the seagull and pigeons, the total fries eaten so far is 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
5. Let's say the number of fries left after the pigeons is \( x \). The raccoon then stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3}x \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( x - \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{1}{3}x \).
7. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, \( \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, before the raccoon, there were 18 fries left. The raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 18, which is 12 fries. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were 18 + 12 = 30 fries.

Adding the fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons:
\[ 30 (remaining before raccoon) + 30 (eaten by Dave, seagull, and pigeons) = 60 \]

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 60.

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. So, he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours each of these days.
- There are 2 days a week like this, so he spends 2 days * 4 hours/day = 8 hours per week on these days.

- In total, Kimo spends 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours per week attending classes.

"First, let's figure out the total length of each type of baked good in inches, and then we'll convert everything to feet.

1. Rolls: 
   - 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

2. Chocolate croissants:
   - 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

3. Baguettes:
   - 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette (since 2 feet = 24 inches) = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up all the lengths in inches:
- Total length in inches = 1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
- Total length in feet = 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods end to end is 280 feet.

"To figure out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many gallons of lemonade they sold. Since they make 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50, each gallon of lemonade brings in:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} \times \$0.50 \text{ per glass} = \$10 \text{ per gallon} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons they sold to make a $25 profit. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ \$3 \text{ for lemons} + \$2 \text{ for sugar} = \$5 \text{ per gallon} \]

So, the profit per gallon is:
\[ \$10 \text{ revenue per gallon} - \$5 \text{ cost per gallon} = \$5 \text{ profit per gallon} \]

To find out how many gallons they sold to make a $25 profit:
\[ \frac{\$25 \text{ profit}}{\$5 \text{ profit per gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we know they sold 5 gallons. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
3. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the crabs they all have:
- Bo: 40 crabs
- Monic: 36 crabs
- Rani: 46 crabs

Total number of crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122

"Lloyd earned $10 for each hour he tutored. In the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned 5 hours times $10, which is $50. In the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned 8 hours times $10, which is $80. To find out how much he earned in the first two weeks, we add the earnings from the first week and the second week together, so $50 + $80 = $130.

"To figure out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver, let's break down the information:

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
2. She ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

First, let's find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. If 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations, then:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Next, since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
3. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, half of Jan's age two years ago is 28 / 2 = 14.
4. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.
5. So, Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.
6. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To figure out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time for each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Team 1:**
- Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team 1: \( 55 \times 4 = 220 \) seconds.

**Team 2:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for Team 2: \( 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in their total times:
- Difference: \( 222 - 220 = 2 \) seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To figure this out, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ \text{Probability of rolling a number greater than 3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ \text{Probability of rolling an even number} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[ \text{Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row} = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Probability of rolling a number greater than 3}}{\text{Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row}} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage:

\[ 2 \times 100\% = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total straw distributed:** 160 pieces
2. **Straw for rats:** Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and they are in 3 cages with an equal number of rats in each cage.
3. **Straw for hamsters:** Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 cages with one hamster in each cage.
4. **Straw for rabbits:** 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

First, let's calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages, so there are 10 hamsters.
- Total straw for hamsters = 10 hamsters * 5 pieces/hamster = 50 pieces

Next, let's calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:
- Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces

Now, let's find out how much straw is left for the rats:
- Total straw distributed = 160 pieces
- Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces
- Straw used for rabbits = 20 pieces
- Straw left for rats = 160 pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's find out the total number of rats:
- Total straw for rats = 90 pieces
- Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats

Since the rats are in 3 cages with an equal number of rats in each cage:
- Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed on a monthly interest of 2%. This means every month, the amount Mandy owes increases by 2% of the original $100.

For the first month, the interest is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]
So, after the first month, Mandy owes:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the interest is again 2% of the original $100:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]
So, after the second month, Mandy owes:
\[ 102 + 2 = 104 \]

For the third month, the interest is again 2% of the original $100:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]
So, after the third month, Mandy owes:
\[ 104 + 2 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

"Let's break this down step by step. The trader buys the bags at $20 each and it costs $2 to transport each bag, so the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22. He sells each bag for $30, so the profit per bag is $30 - $22 = $8. If the total profit is $400, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag: $400 / $8 = 50 bags.

"First, let's figure out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since the tickets cost $20.25, the food cost $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Next, let's add up all the costs:
- Tickets: $20.25
- Food: $15.75
- Rides: 2 rides at $33 each = $33 * 2 = $66

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since there are three friends, they split the total cost evenly:
$102 / 3 = $34

Each of them paid $34.

Now, there are 7 days in a week, so to find out how many pounds they need per day, we divide the total weekly need by 7:

35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

3. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
4. So, after 10 years, the total number of trees is 50 (initial) + 80 (increase) = 130 trees.
5. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, 30% of 130 trees die, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.
6. The number of trees left after 30% die is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

"To figure out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we first need to understand how the lowest score is removed and how the average is calculated.

Brinley's scores so far are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score among these is 71. If we remove 71, the remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, and 86.

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \). After the sixth test, the lowest score will be the minimum of 71 and \( x \). We need to consider two cases:

1. If \( x \) is less than 71, then \( x \) will be the lowest score and will be removed.
2. If \( x \) is 71 or greater, then 71 will be the lowest score and will be removed.

We want the average of the five highest scores to be 93. Let's calculate for both cases:

**Case 1: \( x < 71 \)**
- The scores considered are 89, 92, 100, 86, and \( x \).
- The average is \(\frac{89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x}{5} = 93\).

Solving for \( x \):
\[
\frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
\]
\[
367 + x = 465
\]
\[
x = 98
\]

Since 98 is not less than 71, this case is not possible.

**Case 2: \( x \geq 71 \)**
- The scores considered are 89, 92, 100, 86, and \( x \) (with 71 removed).
- The average is \(\frac{89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x}{5} = 93\).

Solving for \( x \):
\[
\frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
\]
\[
367 + x = 465
\]
\[
x = 98
\]

Since 98 is greater than 71, this case is valid.

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

"First, let's figure out how much Sara needs to buy the jacket and the shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, that's $20 * 2 = $40 for the shoes. So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, she needs $60 - $20 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs by what she earns per lawn: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's figure this out step by step. If we call the number of red chickens R, then the number of white chickens would be R + 2, because Jerry has two more white chickens than red ones.

The red chickens produce 3 eggs each day, so R red chickens would produce 3R eggs a day. The white chickens produce 5 eggs each day, so (R + 2) white chickens would produce 5(R + 2) eggs a day.

Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so the total number of eggs from both red and white chickens is 42. We can write this as:
3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Now, let's solve for R:
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
8R + 10 = 42
8R = 42 - 10
8R = 32
R = 32 / 8
R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Let's think about this step by step. 

First, we know that both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute. This means that in the last 4 minutes, each pool has lost 16 gallons of water (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes).

Let's say the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago was \( S \) gallons. This means the big pool had \( 2S \) gallons 4 minutes ago.

Now, both pools have lost 16 gallons each. So, the small pool now has \( S - 16 \) gallons, and the big pool has \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ 2S - 4S = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2S = -48 \]
\[ S = 24 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 24 gallons. Now, the small pool has:
\[ 24 - 16 = 8 \]

The small pool has 8 gallons now.

"If Harriet is 21 years old now, then Adrian is three times that age, which is 63 years old. Harriet being half the age of Zack means Zack is 42 years old.

In three years:
- Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
- Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
- Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

To find the average age in three years, add their ages together and divide by 3:
24 + 66 + 45 = 135

"First, let's figure out how many points each person scored:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, the points scored by Jojo are:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time she spent on each type of puzzle and then add those times together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes her 10 minutes to finish one.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes per puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes her 5 minutes to finish one.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes per puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Time spent on crossword puzzles + Time spent on sudoku puzzles = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

"First, let's figure out how many cards James has in total after losing and buying some cards.

He starts with:
- 30 fire type
- 20 grass type
- 40 water type

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type

After buying 14 more grass type cards, he has:
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type

Now, the total number of cards is:
- 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is 33%.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together in one minute. Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, which is 2 pieces per minute. So together, they can place:

4 pieces (Kalinda) + 2 pieces (Mom) = 6 pieces per minute

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute:

360 pieces ÷ 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours:

60 minutes ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 1 hour

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest.

84 * 3/4 = 63 watermelons were ready.

So, she took 63 more watermelons home, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

Next, we need to add the 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. The tax amount is:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

So, the total cost of the cars including tax is:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Now, we need to add the registration fee for each car. The registration fee is $1,000 per car, and there are 12 cars, so:

\[ 1,000 \times 12 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration fees to the total cost of the cars including tax:

4. In a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 cherry tomatoes per week.
5. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
6. To find out how many vines are needed, divide the total number of tomatoes needed per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week: 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, if we add 6 to Robert's candies, we can find out how many candies James has:
27 + 6 = 33 candies (James's candies)

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We do this by subtracting the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

   3 people * 2 letters/person * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages

3. Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages each week.

4. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is:
   30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

5. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

The problem states that this difference (28 snails) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( f \), then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, 28 snails is twice the total number of fish, so:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
- Sue's total cookies: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.
- Her sister's total cookies: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, let's add all these costs together to get the total price:
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price is than her budget:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

$9,500"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the transfer fees and the brokerage fee:
- The transfer fees are 3% of $400,000.
- The brokerage fee is 5% of $400,000.

Next, we calculate these fees:
- Transfer fees: \( 3\% \times 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \)
- Brokerage fee: \( 5\% \times 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \)

Now, we add these fees together to find the total fees:
- Total fees: \( 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \)

Next, we subtract the total fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds:
- Net proceeds: \( 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \)

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

118,000"
"First, let's figure out how long it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, and then it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Next, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take:
28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Now, we add the time to heat the oil and the time to cook the chicken:
28 + 23 = 51 minutes

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 51 minutes.

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

For the newspaper ads:
- The cost per ad is $5.
- The number of ads is 50.
- So, the total cost for newspaper ads is 5 * 50 = $250.

For the television ads:
- The cost per ad is $75.
- The number of ads is 15.
- So, the total cost for television ads is 75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, we add the total costs of both types of ads:
- Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375.

So, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads.

1375"
"Okay, let's break it down. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so that means there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Now, half of these golf balls are blue, so 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add them all up:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

So, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms.

"Okay, let's break it down:

- John has 2 houses.
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows, so each house has 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows from bedrooms.
- Each house also has 4 additional windows, so each house has 6 windows + 4 windows = 10 windows.
- Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 2 houses * 10 windows/house = 20 windows.

Now, let's add these together:

$4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother paid with $20.00, so we need to subtract the total cost from the amount she paid to find out how much change she gets back:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

So, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

$5.00"
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body, so that's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800.

Now, let's add up the stitches we know:
- Body: 900 stitches
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches

Total known stitches: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. The total number of stitches for the sleeves is:
1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches

"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.
- So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- So, the total cost for the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of tomato seeds + Cost of celery seeds
- Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200.

So, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

3200"
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Solo Song**: The song has 54 lines, and all of these are Sean's lines.
2. **First Scene**: The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines. Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines in the first scene.
3. **Second Scene**: The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines in the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines Sean has to memorize: \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

"First, let's figure out how many cards had the letter A on them. Carly had 80 cards, and 2/5 of them had the letter A:

80 * 2/5 = 32 cards with A

Now, we need to find out how many cards are left after the ones with A:

80 - 32 = 48 cards left

Next, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B:

48 * 1/2 = 24 cards with B

Now, we need to find out how many cards are left after the ones with B:

48 - 24 = 24 cards left

Then, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C:

24 * 5/8 = 15 cards with C

Finally, we need to find out how many cards are left after the ones with C, which will be the cards with D:

24 - 15 = 9 cards with D

"To figure this out, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the time it takes to dig the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes per small hole.
- For 30 small holes, it will take 30 holes * 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes.

Next, calculate the time it takes to dig the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes per large hole.
- For 15 large holes, it will take 15 holes * 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes.

Now, add the time for both small and large holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

"Okay, let's think about this. If Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 right now, in 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. So, we need to add 10 years to each of their ages. That means we add 10 + 10, which is 20, to their current total age.

So, 20 (their current total age) + 20 (the total number of years added in 10 years) = 40.

"Let's figure this out step by step. If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam right now, and in 9 years Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, we can set up some equations to solve it.

Let's say Sam's current age is S. Then Ruby's current age is 6S.

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be S + 9
- Ruby's age will be 6S + 9

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's solve for S:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
6S - 3S = 27 - 9
3S = 18
S = 18 / 3
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"First, let's figure out how many spots a mamba has. If a cobra has 70 spots and that's twice as many as a mamba, then a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, let's calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. If there are 40 cobras and each has 70 spots, then the total number of spots for the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Next, let's calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. If there are 60 mambas and each has 35 spots, then the total number of spots for the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, let's add the total spots of the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total number of spots. The combined total is 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots. Half of 4900 is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

Next, we need to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3: 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, if each pizza costs $15, the total cost for 13 pizzas is 13 * 15 = $195.

"To figure out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses, let's break it down step by step.

1. Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long.
2. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
3. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
4. The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.
5. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so to find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 inches by 0.25 inches per bead.

17 / 0.25 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"Okay, let's break it down:

- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he doubled that, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote over the two weeks:

- Alani: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 60 stories
- Braylen: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 120 stories
- Margot: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week) = 180 stories

Total number of stories: 60 (Alani) + 120 (Braylen) + 180 (Margot) = 360 stories

2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, let's add those together to find out how many stars are accounted for:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:

"To figure out how much John pays a year for the driving service, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so in a year, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He gets charged $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, the cost is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's add the monthly bonus:
- He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles and the bonus to get the total annual cost:
- Total cost = $30,000 (miles) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800.

So, John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.

"If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, that means Joey loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week). Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks. To lose 8 pounds, Sandy would need 4 times as long as it takes her to lose 2 pounds. So, Sandy will need 4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"First, let's figure out how much you save on each tub of ice cream. The original price is $13, and now it's $11, so you save $13 - $11 = $2 on each tub. If you buy 2 tubs, you save 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, let's look at the milk. Each packet is sold at a discount of $0.5. If you buy 4 packets, you save 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, add the savings from the ice cream and the milk together: $4 + $2 = $6.

So, you will save $6 in total.

"Okay, let's break this down. If a person grows an extra arm every three days, in fifteen days they would grow:

15 days / 3 days per arm = 5 new arms

And if a person grows an extra leg every five days, in fifteen days they would grow:

15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 new legs

So, in total, the person would grow 5 new arms and 3 new legs. Adding these together:

5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs

"First, let's figure out how much Theo spends on the business suits. He buys 6 suits at $100 each:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost for the 3 suitcases at $50 each:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200

So, the total amount spent on the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket is:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to use from his $6000 is:
$6000 - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Now, we subtract the amount he has already spent from the amount he plans to use:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"Okay, let's figure this out. In the family, there are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, and 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs per day

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs per day

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of eggs eaten by the family each day:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs per day

Since the family eats eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they eat in a week (7 days):
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Current Age of Cera**: Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. **Age of Cera Six Years Ago**: Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
3. **Age of Noah Six Years Ago**: Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
4. **Current Age of Noah**: Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, he is now 20 + 6 = 26 years old.
5. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago**: The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. So, the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
6. **Population of Chile Now**: Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"Let's break this down. If we say the number of players on the defense is D, then the number of players on the offense is 2D (since it's twice as many), and the number of players on the special teams is D/2 (since it's half as many as the defense).

So, if we add all these up, we get the total number of players, which is 105:
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combining like terms, we get:
3.5D = 105

Now, to find D, we divide both sides by 3.5:
D = 105 / 3.5
D = 30

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"First, let's figure out how many people Martha invited in total. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each.

2 families * 6 people = 12 people
3 families * 4 people = 12 people

So, 12 people + 12 people = 24 people invited.

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 1/4 of that number had previous commitments, so:

1/4 * 8 = 2 people

So, 8 people + 2 people = 10 people couldn't come.

Therefore, the number of people who show up is the total number of people invited minus the number of people who couldn't come:

24 people - 10 people = 14 people

Now, let's add all the marbles together:
- Marbles from Johanna: 20
- Marbles already in the store: 50
- Marbles from his father: 8

Total marbles = 20 + 50 + 8 = 78

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
78 marbles * 2 kg/marble = 156 kg

"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first and then multiply that by the cost per cubic foot.

The volume of the pool is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth:
Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 5 feet
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
Cost = Volume × Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 cubic feet × $0.1 per cubic foot

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of people at the party at the beginning:
25 men + 15 women = 40 people.

Next, we need to find out how many people left after an hour. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left:
1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men:
25 men - 22 men = 3 men left.

So, out of the 10 people who left, 3 were men. This means the rest must have been women:
10 people - 3 men = 7 women left.

Since there were originally 15 women:
15 women - 7 women = 8 women stayed at the party.

So, the number of women left is 8.

"First, let's figure out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which total 26 pencils. So, the pencils in the boxes are:

26 pencils - 2 loose pencils = 24 pencils in the boxes

Since there are 3 boxes, each box has:

24 pencils ÷ 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, let's find out how many boxes Meg needs for her 46 pencils. If each box holds 8 pencils, then:

46 pencils ÷ 8 pencils per box = 5.75 boxes

Since Meg can't have a fraction of a box, she will need 6 boxes to store all her pencils.

Now, let's add the number of boxes Jam and Meg need together:

Jam's 3 boxes + Meg's 6 boxes = 9 boxes

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes in total to store all their pencils.

"To figure out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees:
- Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
- So, the number of ice cubes needed is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \) ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker:
- With 5 ice cubes, the coffee is \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters weaker.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee.

So, the total amount the coffee is weakened is:
- \( 60 \) milliliters (from the ice cubes) + \( 15 \) milliliters (from the cream) = \( 75 \) milliliters.

"First, let's figure out how many junior programmers there are. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and the company has 100 employees:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers would be:

Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to all junior programmers is:

Total paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000

Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer, so:

Salary of each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

The total amount paid to all senior programmers is:

Total paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Now, to find the total amount paid to all the programmers, we add the amounts paid to junior and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say \( x \) people got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first stop, 5 more people got in, so now there are \( x + 5 \) people on the bus.
3. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 got on. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

We know that after the second stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20 \]
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, boating and swimming together took:
6 + 3 = 9 hours

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so that's:
3 * 2 = 6 hours

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
9 + 6 = 15 hours

This 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. To find the total time, we set up the equation:
15 = 0.30 * Total Time

Solving for Total Time:
Total Time = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
0.40 * 50 = 20 hours

"First, let's figure out how much money Annabelle earns from both jobs.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours, so:
$10 * 20 = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours, so:
$5 * 15 = $75

Now, let's add up all the money she has:
Money from savings: $80
Money from first job: $200
Money from second job: $75

Total money she has: $80 + $200 + $75 = $355

The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:
$400 - $355 = $45

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.
3. The combined height of the shortest and second tree is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.
4. The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second tree, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet tall.

"First, let's figure out how much Dean spent at the toy store. 

He bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12

He also bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent:
$12 (for toy cars) + $5 (for teddy bears) = $17

Dean started with $28 and spent $17, so the amount of money he has left is:
$28 - $17 = $11

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
$11 + $10 = $21

"Let's break it down. Morgan has $90 for the party. Each person, including Morgan, needs to pay for one round of mini-golf, two rides on the go-karts, and $5 in arcade tokens.

- Mini-golf: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 x 2 = $20
- Arcade tokens: $5

So, each person needs $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we need to see how many people can be covered with $90. 

$90 ÷ $30 = 3

This means 3 people can be covered, but one of those is Morgan. So, she can invite 2 friends.

"Okay, let's break this down. Marisa gets $5 every day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. 

First, we need to find out how much she spends on lollipops each day:
4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents = $1

So, she spends $1 on lollipops each day. Now, let's see how much she saves each day:
$5 - $1 = $4

She saves $4 each day. If she saves for 5 days, we need to multiply the amount she saves each day by 5:
$4 * 5 = $20

So, the total amount she puts in her piggy bank in 5 days is:
$20

"First, let's figure out how much Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so that's 40 * $0.05 = $2. This $2 is half of his change, so his total change must have been $2 * 2 = $4.

Billy started with $10, and his change was $4, so he must have spent $10 - $4 = $6 on candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds he bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4 pounds.

"Let's figure this out step by step. If Carver is 45 years old and he is 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can set up the equation:

45 = 2 * (son's age) - 5

Now, we solve for the son's age:

45 + 5 = 2 * (son's age)
50 = 2 * (son's age)
50 / 2 = son's age
25 = son's age

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's figure out the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the daily distance is:
300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"First, let's figure out how much stuffing a collie bed needs. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. The average between these two is (8 + 2) / 2, which is 10 / 2, so 5 pounds for a collie bed.

Now, for 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 beds * 2 pounds per bed, which is 8 pounds of stuffing.

For 3 collie beds, he needs 3 beds * 5 pounds per bed, which is 15 pounds of stuffing.

Adding these together, 8 pounds for the chihuahua beds and 15 pounds for the collie beds, Mark needs a total of 8 + 15 pounds of stuffing.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how long it took John to drive to his friend's house. The original distance was 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles, so the total distance to his friend's house was 210 miles. He drove at a speed of 70 mph.

To find the time, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to get to his friend's house is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to figure out how long it took John to drive back home. The distance back home was 240 miles, and he drove at a speed of 80 mph.

So, the time to get back home is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time for both parts of the trip:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks:**
   - 3 people

2. **Number of people kicked out for shoplifting:**
   - This is four times the number of people who refused to wear masks, minus 5.
   - \( 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \) people

3. **Number of people kicked out for physical violence:**
   - This is three times the number of shoplifters.
   - \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) people

4. **Total number of people kicked out:**
   - 50 people

5. **Number of people kicked out for other reasons:**
   - Total number of people kicked out minus the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.

2. **Cost of etching:**
   - Each picture frame needs to be etched, which adds an additional 20% to the cost.
   - The additional cost per frame is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.20 = 4
     \]
   - The total additional cost for etching all 44 frames is:
     \[
     44 \times 4 = 176

"If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, he would save 20% on the cost of buying it from the market. The market price is $400, so 20% of $400 is $80. This means Ethan would save $80 by making it himself.

To find out how much Ethan spent, we subtract the savings from the market price:
$400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

Number of apples sold on Monday = $56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so:
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * 12 = 24 apples

Now, let's add up all the apples picked over the three days:

"To figure out how much Karan has to pay each month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will have to pay over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, we need to find the interest for that period.

1. Calculate the annual interest:
   \( 3,650 \times 10\% = 3,650 \times 0.10 = 365 \)

2. Since the interest is for a year, we need to find the interest for five months. There are 12 months in a year, so:
   \( \frac{365}{12} \times 5 = 152.08 \)

3. Add the interest to the principal to get the total amount to be paid:
   \( 3,650 + 152.08 = 3,802.08 \)

4. Divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, find the difference in the distances:
- Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
- Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther.

"First, let's figure out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. She can make 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so:
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:
36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Now, we need to calculate her profit. Profit is the total money made minus the cost of supplies. The supplies cost her $18, so:
$36 - $18 = $18 profit

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Finally, to find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours:
$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

So, Millie makes $2 profit per hour.

"Okay, let's think about this. If Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left. The 12.8 hectares represent the 2/5 of his land. To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1/5 of his land is and then multiply that by 5.

First, we find out what 1/5 of his land is:
12.8 hectares is 2/5, so 1/5 would be 12.8 divided by 2, which is 6.4 hectares.

Now, to find the total land, we multiply 6.4 hectares by 5:
6.4 * 5 = 32 hectares

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. The choir has 52 members.
2. 50% of the choir members are boys, and 50% are girls.
   - So, the number of girls in the choir is 50% of 52, which is \( 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \) girls.
3. The performance is only with the female members, so 26 girls are supposed to perform.
4. On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down.
   - So, half of 26 girls can't make it, which is \( 26 \times 0.5 = 13 \) girls.
5. The remaining girls who can make it are \( 26 - 13 = 13 \) girls.

"To figure out how much David saves, we need to compare the cost of the ride bracelet to the cost of buying individual ride tickets for 9 rides.

First, let's calculate the cost of 9 rides using individual tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- So, the cost for one ride is 2 tickets * $2 per ticket = $4.
- For 9 rides, the total cost is 9 rides * $4 per ride = $36.

Now, let's look at the cost of the ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

David buys the ride bracelet, so he spends $30.
Dasha buys individual tickets, so she spends $36.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of the individual tickets:
- Savings = Cost of individual tickets - Cost of ride bracelet
- Savings = $36 - $30 = $6

So, David saves $6.

"To figure out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to understand the ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's popsicles is 5:6, which means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we add the parts of the ratio together: 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Next, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts to find out how many popsicles each part represents: 165 ÷ 11 = 15 popsicles per part.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"First, let's figure out how much Tim spends on the streaming services.

Netflix costs $10 a month.

Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling them. So, the total cost for both before the discount is $10 + $10 = $20.

The discount is 20% of $20, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.

So, the cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the streaming services:
$10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Tim was paying $60 for his cable package. Now, he pays $26 for the streaming services.

The amount of money he saves is $60 - $26 = $34.

Next, we need to see how many cards she passed out. She passed out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, which is 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, we subtract the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had: 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

Finally, we add the 17 cards she received from family and friends to the cards she has left: 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"First, let's figure out how many slices Bill and Mark get.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, Bill gets:
12 slices * 1/3 = 4 slices

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So Mark gets:
12 slices * 1/4 = 3 slices

Now, let's add up the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices herself, so we add those to the total number of slices taken:
7 slices (Bill and Mark) + 2 slices (Jenny) = 9 slices

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices taken from the original 12 slices to find out how many are left:
12 slices - 9 slices = 3 slices

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders. So, the number of millipedes is:
   \[
   \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]
3. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, let's add up all the bugs:
\[
90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168
\]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

"Okay, let's break it down. John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, he drinks a total of 16 ounces of milk. If milk has 3 calories per ounce, then 16 ounces of milk would have 16 times 3 calories.

16 * 3 = 48

So, John consumed 48 calories.

"Okay, let's break this down. The builder works for 4 weeks every month, and each week he works 6 days. So, in one month, he works:

4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days/month

He gets paid $50 every day, so in one month, he earns:

24 days/month * $50/day = $1200/month

There are 12 months in a year, so in one year, he earns:

12 months/year * $1200/month = $14,400/year

So, the builder earns $14,400 in a year.

"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient. So, for flour, he needs 4 times 3 cups, which is 12 cups. For milk, he needs 4 times 1 cup, which is 4 cups.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so to get 12 cups, Mark needs 12 divided by 2, which is 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so to get 4 cups, Mark needs 4 divided by 2, which is 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much energy Mel uses with the air conditioner each day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour, and Mel uses it for 8 hours a day. So, the daily energy usage is:

900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watts/day

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily usage to kilowatts:

7200 watts/day ÷ 1000 = 7.2 kW/day

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:

8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day

The new daily energy usage will be:

900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watts/day

Converting this to kilowatts:

2700 watts/day ÷ 1000 = 2.7 kW/day

The energy saved each day by reducing the usage is:

7.2 kW/day - 2.7 kW/day = 4.5 kW/day

To find out how much energy is saved over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:

4.5 kW/day * 30 days = 135 kW

So, the total energy saved in 30 days is:

135 kW

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, first, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the 36-striped zebra: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average:
\[88 \div 4 = 22\]

"To figure out how much Tyson will spend, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Tyson needs to serve 20 people.
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - So, the number of sandwiches needed is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, he will need \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds of meat and \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds of cheese.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - The total cost for the meat is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \) dollars.
   - The total cost for the cheese is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

4. **Add the costs together:**
   - Total cost for meat and cheese is \( 35 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

So, Tyson will spend $50 on the meat and cheese.

"First, let's figure out how many corns Allan originally has. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, he must have:

40 cannolis * 2 = 80 corns

Now, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is:

40 cannolis + 60 cannolis = 100 cannolis

He also buys 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis, so the number of corns he buys is:

100 cannolis - 40 = 60 corns

Adding these 60 corns to the original 80 corns, the new total of corns is:

80 corns + 60 corns = 140 corns

Now, to find the combined total of corns and cannolis, we add the new totals together:

140 corns + 100 cannolis = 240

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He already did half of his steps to and from school, which means he did 5,000 steps. Then he did another 1,000 steps walking with his friend. So, before the jog, he had done 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. That means he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps done by the end of his jog. So, the number of steps he took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"First, let's figure out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words, so:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read 9000 words at a rate of 300 words per minute:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, the total time he needs to leave is:
60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading and have:
50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To find out how much the company paid to the employees in May and June, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Pay rate: $15 per hour
   - Total hours worked by one employee in May: 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours
   - Total pay for one employee in May: 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400
   - Total pay for all employees in May: 40 employees * $2400/employee = $96,000

2. **Calculate the number of employees in June:**
   - 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
   - Number of employees in June: 40 * 3/4 = 30 employees

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Total hours worked by one employee in June: 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours
   - Total pay for one employee in June: 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400
   - Total pay for all employees in June: 30 employees * $2400/employee = $72,000

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   - Total payment for May and June: $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"First, let's figure out how much Sally spent on the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs half of $3, which is $1.50. 

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
$3 + $1.50 = $4.50

Next, she bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, she bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each. The total cost for the magnets is:
4 * $0.25 = $1.00

Now, let's add up all her expenses:
$4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00

Sally started with $10. So, the amount of money she has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00

"First, let's figure out how much the second pack of fireworks costs. It's twice the cost of the first pack, so it's $400 * 2 = $800.

Now, let's add the cost of the first and second packs together: $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on these packs, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The cost of the packs after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the packs: $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, Tim spent a total of $1110.

"To figure this out, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many candles are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, that means 1% of them might explode.
2. Calculate 1% of 50,000 candles.
3. Next, we know that 5% of the exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
4. Calculate 5% of the number of exploding candles.

Let's do the math:

1. 1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles
2. 5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"Okay, let's figure this out. If the regular price for each blouse is $20 and they are 30% off, that means Misha gets a discount of 30% on each blouse. 

First, we calculate the discount amount for one blouse:
30% of $20 = 0.30 * $20 = $6

So, the discount is $6 per blouse. Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the sale price of one blouse:
$20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the sale price of one blouse by 4:
$14 * 4 = $56

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples
   - From the average trees: Let's call this \( x \) apples

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - From the average trees: 0 apples

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x \)
   - Sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 \)

4. **Combined total:**
   - \( (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500 \)
   - \( 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \)
   - \( 150 + x = 500 \)
   - \( x = 500 - 150 \)
   - \( x = 350 \)

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To figure out how many dromedaries there are, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of animals and humps:**
   - Total heads (animals) = 180
   - Total humps = 304

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of camels.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.
   - Each camel has 1 head and 2 humps.
   - Each dromedary has 1 head and 1 hump.

3. **Write the equations based on the information:**
   - Total heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
   - Total humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - From the first equation: \( D = 180 - C \)
   - Substitute \( D \) in the second equation: \( 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \)
   - Simplify: \( 2C + 180 - C = 304 \)
   - Combine like terms: \( C + 180 = 304 \)
   - Solve for \( C \): \( C = 304 - 180 \)
   - \( C = 124 \)

5. **Find the number of dromedaries:**
   - \( D = 180 - C \)
   - \( D = 180 - 124 \)
   - \( D = 56 \)

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"Okay, let's break it down:

- In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day. So, for 4 days, that's:
  200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

- Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, 30% of 800 km is:
  0.30 * 800 km = 240 km

- On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so that's 0 km.

- During the second week (7 days), he traveled 300 kilometers each day. So, for 7 days, that's:
  300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add all the distances together:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
3140 km

"First, let's figure out the cost of the jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less, so:

Jogger jeans cost = $28 - $6 = $22

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, so:

Savings from jogger jeans = 1/3 * $6 = $2

The rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans, so:

Savings from tattered jeans = $6 - $2 = $4

Now, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to add the savings back to the sale prices. 

Original price of tattered jeans = $28 + $4 = $32
Original price of jogger jeans = $22 + $2 = $24

The difference in original cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

$24 - $32 = -$8

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which implies a positive difference. Since the tattered jeans actually cost more originally, the correct interpretation is that the jogger jeans cost $8 less, not more. Thus, the answer is:

3. Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards.
4. If 100 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, then the total number of cards he started with is 100 / (2/3) = 100 * (3/2) = 150 cards.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"Okay, let's break this down. The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests, and he made enough for half of them to have two hotdogs. So, half of 36 is 18. This means he prepared 18 hotdogs for the 18 guests to have one each, and another 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests to have a second one. That's a total of 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

But 40 guests showed up, and all of them wanted a second hotdog. That means they needed 40 hotdogs for the first round and 40 more for the second round, totaling 80 hotdogs.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20%, so we find 20% of $165.00:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"Okay, let's break this down. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he had 5 cents left. So, he actually spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * 40 cents = 120 cents or $1.20 on chips.

That means he spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

"Rory made a cake that weighs 20 ounces and cuts it into 8 pieces. Each piece would weigh 20 ounces divided by 8 pieces, which is 2.5 ounces per piece. If Rory and her mom each have a piece, that's 2 pieces in total, so 2 pieces times 2.5 ounces per piece equals 5 ounces. The remaining cake would be the original 20 ounces minus the 5 ounces they ate, which is 15 ounces.

15 ounces"
"First, let's find out how many oranges Sitti and Juris have in total. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, together they have:

34 + 22 = 56 oranges

Now, they want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. Including Sitti and Juris, there are 8 people in total. To find out how many oranges each person gets, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges.

"First, let's figure out how much onions Antoine will use. He doubles the 2 pounds, so he uses 4 pounds of onions. The onions cost $2.00 a pound, so 4 pounds will cost 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, he needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00, so 2 * $2.00 = $4.00 for the beef stock.

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock together: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.

"If Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, then Bernadette's drive takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to account for her longer drive time plus the 5 minutes. Wayne leaves and arrives in 4 minutes, so Bernadette needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes early.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, 3 yards is equal to 9 feet.

The area of the room is given as 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, if the length is 9 feet, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find the perimeter of the room, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate how many beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- So, Elizabeth has 1 pack * 20 beads/pack + 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads + 40 beads = 60 beads.

Next, we calculate how many beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- So, Margareth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack + 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads + 80 beads = 140 beads.

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
- Margareth has 140 beads, and Elizabeth has 60 beads.
- The difference is 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads.

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees. So, 3 hours * 5 degrees per hour = 15 degrees increase.
3. After baking, the temperature of the house is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
4. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3, and 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees decrease.
5. After opening the window, the temperature of the house is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

"First, let's figure out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes (80 minutes)
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
  10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes, so James takes 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.
- James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.
  So, James takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike.

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \).

Total time for James:
36 + 85 + \( R \) = 121 + \( R \)

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
121 + \( R \) = 170 + 10
121 + \( R \) = 180

Solving for \( R \):
\( R \) = 180 - 121
\( R \) = 59

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

1. First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Movie C is 1.25 hours long.
   - 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
   - Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

3. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B.
   - Movie A = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

"First, let's figure out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. 

30 minutes is half an hour, so:
32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles:
16 miles * 1/2 bail of hay per mile = 8 bails of hay

Each bail of hay costs $3, so:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means:
6 * $5 = $30

Now, subtract the cost of the hay from the money Michael has:
$30 - $24 = $6

So, the change Michael has after buying the hay is:

"First, let's figure out how many eggs Rozanne has in total. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 extra eggs. 

1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs
4 dozen eggs = 4 * 12 = 48 eggs

Adding the 2 loose eggs:
48 + 2 = 50 eggs

Now, each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, the total number of glasses she can make is:
50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. So, the number of trays she can put out is:
10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays

225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, to find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score:

240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points.

"First, let's figure out how much the salesman paid for each sneaker. He bought 48 sneakers for $576, so each sneaker cost him $576 / 48 = $12.

Next, let's calculate how much he made from the flash sale. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 * $20 = $340 from the flash sale.

Now, let's find out how many sneakers he had left after the flash sale. He started with 48 sneakers and sold 17, so he had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.

He then sold these 31 sneakers to a department store for $25 each, so he made 31 * $25 = $775 from the department store.

Now, let's add up all the money he made from selling the sneakers. He made $340 from the flash sale and $775 from the department store, so in total, he made $340 + $775 = $1115.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total money made. The total cost was $576, and the total money made was $1115, so the profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, for the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, add the two totals together:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

So, Beatrice bought 112 crayons in all.

"Let's break this down. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of buying the regular ticket plus the popcorn and soda was $2 less than the super ticket plus the extra $1 for the popcorn and soda.

The super ticket costs $20, and the extra for popcorn and soda is $1, so the total for the super ticket option is $21.

If you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda must have been $21 - $2 = $19.

The regular ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3, so the cost of the popcorn is $19 - $12 - $3 = $4.

- For the second part, the car drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

Now, add the distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

Next, add the times to get the total time:
- Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Finally, calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

4. She also has 2 rubies.

Now, let's calculate the value of her jewels:
- Each sapphire is worth $800.
- Each ruby is worth $1200.

So, the value of her sapphires is:
5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

The value of her rubies is:

"First, we need to figure out how much soil Bob needs. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume of one raised bed, we multiply these dimensions:

2 feet (width) x 8 feet (length) x 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10:

32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we need to find out how many bags Bob needs:

320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

160 bags x $12 per bag = $1920

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. There are 15 red cards.
2. Green cards are 60% more than the red cards. So, we need to find 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   - 60% of 15 is 0.60 * 15 = 9.
   - So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.
3. Yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards.
   - The sum of red and green cards is 15 + 24 = 39.
   - So, there are 39 yellow cards.

Next, we add up all the puppies with spots:
3 (Jennifer's spotted puppies) + 4 (Brandon's spotted puppies) = 7 spotted puppies in total.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100:
(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%.

"To figure out how many trips the farmer needs, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he's buying.

1. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. **Hay**: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, add up all the weights:
2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

Next, let's find out how many baseball cards she has. She has 5 boxes, and each box has 40 cards. So, 5 boxes times 40 cards per box is 200 baseball cards.

Now, let's add the basketball and baseball cards together to find the total number of cards. 150 basketball cards plus 200 baseball cards equals 350 cards in total.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we need to subtract those from the total. 350 cards minus 50 cards is 300 cards.

If each student gets 10 cards, we need to divide the remaining cards by 10 to find out how many students there are. 300 cards divided by 10 cards per student is 30 students.

20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 1000 cents

In dollars, that's:

1000 cents / 100 = $10.00

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is:

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, let's break it down:

1. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats.
2. He gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.

So, if we let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks, the number of cookies Matt can have is \( \frac{c}{2} + 2 \).

We know Matt wants 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{c}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

First, subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{c}{2} = 3 \]

Next, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

First, calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of 200 employees each.
- So, 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Next, calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- So, 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, add the number of employees and tour guides together:
- 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

So, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Plane tickets:**
   - Each ticket costs $5000.
   - Tom and his wife need 2 tickets.
   - Total cost for plane tickets: \( 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \).

2. **Hotel cost:**
   - The normal price per day is $1500.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day: \( 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \).
   - They are staying for 3 days.
   - Total cost for the hotel: \( 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \).

3. **Total cost of the trip:**
   - Plane tickets: $10000
   - Hotel: $5400
   - Total cost: \( 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \).

So, the total cost of the trip is:

"Okay, let's figure this out. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and the 2010 penny is three-quarters of that weight, we need to find out what three-quarters of 48 grains is. 

Three-quarters of 48 grains is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. Now, to find the combined weight of both pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny together:
\[ 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

Now, let's find out how many more songs each can add to their players. The media player can hold up to 100 songs.

Gabriel can add:
100 - 20 = 80 songs

Luri can add:
100 - 60 = 40 songs

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:

80 - 40 = 40

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel can.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Uncle Ben has 4 horses.
2. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
3. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse eats 5 pounds x 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.
4. For 4 horses, the total amount of oats needed per day is 10 pounds x 4 = 40 pounds.
5. Over 5 days, the total amount of oats needed is 40 pounds x 5 = 200 pounds.
6. Each bag of oats contains 50 pounds.
7. To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total pounds of oats by the pounds per bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cost of Razors Without Sale:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Sale:**
   - With the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack when she buys 2 packs.
   - So, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - She has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the total cost:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Total Cost for 2 Packs:**
   - The total cost after the sale and coupon is $2.00.

5. **Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - She buys 2 packs, so the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

6. **Cost Per Razor:**
   - The total cost is $2.00, and she gets 8 razors.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

7. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

So, the cost per individual razor after the discount is 25 cents.

"To figure out the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of all the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and going to the top.

First, we know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, will be at the top.

The pyramid is built as follows:
- 4 girls on the bottom
- 3 girls on the next level
- 2 girls on the next level
- 1 girl at the top

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the girls, one on top of the other.

Let's calculate the total height in inches:
- Bottom level: 4 girls * 64 inches = 256 inches
- Second level: 3 girls * 64 inches = 192 inches
- Third level: 2 girls * 64 inches = 128 inches
- Top level: 1 girl * 60 inches = 60 inches

Now, add these heights together:
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
636 / 12 = 53 feet

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

Next, we calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
14 days * $2/ride = $28

Now, we add the costs together:
$84 + $28 = $112

So, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"First, let's figure out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Together, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 Greek orange pies.

"To figure out how many guests are needed for the two venues to cost the same, let's break it down:

1. **First Venue:**
   - Flat fee: $200
   - Food cost per person: $5
   - Total cost for \( x \) guests: \( 200 + 5x \)

2. **Second Venue:**
   - Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
   - Total cost for \( x \) guests: \( 25x \)

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) where the total costs are equal:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the two venues will cost the same when there are 10 guests.

"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, let's say Bodhi found \( B \) insects. According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

The total number of insects found by all three is 43. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]
\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. 

Now, let's find out how many David found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

David found 9 insects. 

Finally, let's find out how many Lily found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

So, together they used 3/4 of a skein. Now, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply 364 by 3/4:

364 * 3/4 = 364 * 0.75 = 273

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet.
4. The couch is 2 feet longer than 16 feet, so the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The couch is 18 feet long.

"Let's break this down step by step. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. She got two packs of strawberry gum, one pack of grape gum, and one pack of green apple gum. The grape gum cost $2, and the green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum, so that's $1. 

The total cost for all the gum is $7. We can set up the equation like this:

\[ 2 \times \text{strawberry cost} + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

First, we add the costs of the grape and green apple gum:

\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Now, we subtract this from the total cost:

\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

This means the total cost for the two packs of strawberry gum is $4. Since there are two packs, we divide by 2:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

"To figure out the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to see how many sticks he can get from the cheapest option within his budget.

First, let's see how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:
- Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4.
- So, $24 / $4 = 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Next, we calculate how many sticks he can get from these 6 pieces:
- Each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks.
- So, 6 pieces * 200 sticks per piece = 1200 sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

"First, let's figure out how much Janet spends on bus trips without the pass. She takes 2 bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, for one day, she spends:

2 trips/day * $2.20/trip = $4.40/day

Since she does this 5 days a week, her weekly cost is:

$4.40/day * 5 days/week = $22.00/week

Now, if she buys the weekly bus pass for $20, she would only spend $20 a week. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from what she would normally spend:

$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

So, Janet would save $2.00 each week by buying the pass.

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, we solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

So, the lot costs $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot:

So, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:
- Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80

This means Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining $80 to buy dinner:

"Let's figure this out step by step.

1. Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked by each person per hour:
- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts

"To figure out how many rows Jackson will plant, we need to divide the total number of each type of tulip by the number that can fit in a row. 

For the red tulips:
- He has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- So, 36 divided by 6 equals 6 rows of red tulips.

For the blue tulips:
- He has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- So, 24 divided by 8 equals 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the rows of red and blue tulips together:
- 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows total.

So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

"First, we need to figure out how many cups of raisins Heather will use for the oatmeal cookies. Since she divides the 27 cups of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will use:

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups for the oatmeal cookies.

Now, to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, we divide the 9 cups of raisins by the amount needed for one batch, which is 3/4 of a cup:

9 cups / (3/4 cup per batch) = 9 * (4/3) = 12 batches.

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"First, let's figure out how much Ada pays for her electric bill before adding the new device. 

Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. So, in a week (7 days), she uses:
12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours/day * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts

At $1.50 per kilowatt, her weekly bill is:
2016 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt = $3024

Now, let's add the new device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so in a week, it will use:
2 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours/day * 7 days = 336 kilowatts

The cost for the new device's consumption in a week is:
336 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt = $504

So, the total weekly bill after adding the new device is:
$3024 + $504 = $3528

The difference between the new weekly bill and the old weekly bill is:
$3528 - $3024 = $504

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.
5. Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs:
   - Ophelia's sofas: 20
   - Ophelia's chairs: 22
   - Jenna's sofas: 64
   - Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas and chairs: 20 + 22 + 64 + 66 = 172

"To figure out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. 

Tom paid $48 in total. The CD cost $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is:
$48 - $4 = $44

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $44 left. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many CDs he could buy with $44 by dividing $44 by $4:
$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

"To find out the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to add up the hours he spent each week. Normally, he worked out for 4 hours a week. However, there were a few weeks where he worked out more:

- For 5 of the weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, calculate the total hours for the 5 weeks he worked out 4 hours each:
5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours

Next, calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he worked out 5 hours each:
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

Then, calculate the total hours for the 1 week he worked out 6 hours:
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, add all these hours together:
20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. So, one-third of 21 is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:

66"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. So, right now, Jame is:
   27 - 5 = 22 years old.

2. In 8 years, Jame will be:
   22 + 8 = 30 years old.

3. In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, in 8 years, his cousin will be:
   2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

4. If his cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years, then right now his cousin is:
   55 - 8 = 47 years old.

5. The difference in their ages right now is:
   47 - 22 = 25 years.

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25.

"Okay, let's break this down. Errol bought a computer for $1,100. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700. The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. So, the cost of the 2 monitors together is $2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600. Since there are 2 monitors, one monitor costs $600 / 2 = $300.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know there are 20 kids in total, and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 shells. So, the total number of shells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ shells/boy} = 600 \text{ shells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ shells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ shells} = 600 \text{ shells} + 2400 \text{ shells} = 3000 \text{ shells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of shells brought by each girl is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ shells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ shells/girl} \]

So, each girl brought back 300 shells.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it's 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thickness of all four books:

"Okay, so if the dinner bill is $50 and you need to pay an additional 20% tip, first you calculate the tip:

20% of $50 is $10.

So the total amount, including the tip, is $50 + $10, which is $60.

Since you're splitting the check evenly but paying the whole tip, you pay half of the original bill plus the entire tip:

Half of $50 is $25, plus the $10 tip, so you pay $35.

   - $6 + $5 = $11

3. The next day, he adds another $10.
   - $11 + $10 = $21

4. He then spends $8 from his total.
   - $21 - $8 = $13

"To figure out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, let's break it down:

1. April has 30 days, so the first half is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days.
2. Let's say Elvis saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half.
3. In the second half, he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day.
4. The total savings for the month would be \( 15x + 15(2x) = 15x + 30x = 45x \).
5. We know his monthly saving target is $1125, so \( 45x = 1125 \).
6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \).

So, Elvis needs to save \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars each day in the second half of April.

"First, let's figure out how much Verna spent on each type of fruit.

For the apples:
3 apples * $1.50 per apple = $4.50

For the oranges:
5 oranges * $0.80 per orange = $4.00

For the peaches:
6 peaches * $0.75 per peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so to find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from $20:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, Verna received $7.00 in change.

- Geometry set: 1 geometry set × $10 = $10

Now, add these amounts together to get the total cost before the discount:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Next, calculate the 10% discount:

Next, we need to calculate the commission on the sales over $1000. Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500. 

The commission on the additional $1500 is 10%. 

10% of $1500 = 0.10 * $1500 = $150

Twice as long as 16 minutes is 32 minutes, and 2 minutes more than that is 34 minutes. So, in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions:

- In cold water: 3 miles × 16 minutes per mile = 48 minutes
- In warm water: 3 miles × 34 minutes per mile = 102 minutes

"To figure out how much more money Mitchell made, we first need to calculate how much money Mitchell made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so:

21 lemonades * $4/lemonade = $84

Now, we know Liam made $63. To find out how much more Mitchell made, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

$84 - $63 = $21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

"Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we divide $70 by 7:
\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]
So, Peter spends $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures that cost $5 each. To find out how many wooden action figures he buys each day, we divide the daily spending by the cost of one wooden action figure:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]
So, he buys 2 wooden action figures each day for 4 days. The total number of wooden action figures he buys is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he spends $10 each day on plastic action figures that cost $2 each. To find out how many plastic action figures he buys each day, we divide the daily spending by the cost of one plastic action figure:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]
So, he buys 5 plastic action figures each day for 3 days. The total number of plastic action figures he buys is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Adding the total number of wooden and plastic action figures together, we get:
\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have 23 action figures.

"To figure out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows in a month. Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, and Ford grows 40 roses each week, he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Next, let's add up how many roses the flower shops order in a month. The first shop orders 20 roses per week, the second orders 15 roses per week, and the third orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered by all shops in a week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/week

Now, to find out how many roses are ordered in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Finally, to find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the number of roses he grows in a month from the number of roses the shops order in a month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To figure out the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find the cost of the bread for 10 sandwiches:
- The bread costs $3.00 per loaf.
- Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
- So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

Next, the cost of the cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

Now, let's add the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments to get the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
- Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
- Total cost = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:
- Each sandwich is sold for $7.00.
- So, the total revenue from 10 sandwiches is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

Finally, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
- Net profit = $37.00

"First, let's figure out the area of Michael's bedroom. The room measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost for each part of the job:

1. The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it will be 216 * 12 = $2,592.
2. The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it will be 216 * 2 = $432.
3. The cost to remove the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it will be 216 * 4 = $864.
4. The cost to install the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it will be 216 * 34 = $7,344.

Now, let's add all these costs together to find the total cost:
$2,592 (new carpet) + $432 (padding) + $864 (removal) + $7,344 (installation) = $11,232.

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11,232.

"To find out how many birds Mack saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds he saw over the seven days and then divide that number by 7.

On days one and two, he saw 50 birds in total.
On day three, he saw 0 birds.
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds in total.
On day six, he saw 20 birds.
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

So, the total number of birds he saw is 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days, which is 7.

280 ÷ 7 = 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. We need to add half of this starting value to itself: 
   \( 20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30 \).
3. Next, we divide this result by 5:
   \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
4. Then, we need to find the starting value minus 12:
   \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
5. Finally, we multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4:
   \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

So, the final value of the number train is 48.

"First, let's figure out by what percentage the oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it actually reaches 468 degrees. 

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

This means the oven is running 4% hotter than the set temperature.

Now, if Maggie's recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature she should set the oven to so that it runs 4% hotter and reaches 520 degrees.

Let's call the temperature she needs to set the oven to ""x"". We know that 104% of x should equal 520 degrees:

1.04 * x = 520

To find x, we divide both sides by 1.04:

x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees.

2. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.
3. Her friend brought 40 cups.
4. Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the utensils brought by Judy and her friend:
- Total cups: 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups
- Total dishes: 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes

Finally, the total number of utensils is:
52 (cups) + 68 (dishes) = 120

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs. There are 90 pairs in 180 contacts.

So, $180 divided by 90 pairs is $2 per pair.

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked:
- On Saturday, John worked twice as long as Jill, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- Total hours John worked = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both:
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

"First, let's figure out how many calories Hannah burns in total.

She does aerobics for 2 hours, burning 500 calories per hour. So, for aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

Then, she runs for 1 hour, burning 600 calories per hour. So, for running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. So, we need to find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

1. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).
2. According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue).
3. The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue).

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Now, solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500.

Next, we find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

Finally, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

Now, we need to find the average of these three measurements:
- First measurement: 47 WPM
- Second measurement: 52 WPM
- Third measurement: 57 WPM

To find the average, we add these three numbers together and then divide by 3.

   1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

2. If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain:
   1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, to find the total difference in weight between the two options:
8.75 pounds (gain from donuts) + 6.25 pounds (loss from Cheerios) = 15 pounds

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

   \[ 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound of butter per day} \]
4. Juan wants to make these croissants for a week, which is 7 days.
5. Therefore, for 7 days, he will need:
   \[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we first need to calculate the cost to repave each street.

For Monica's street:
- Length: 150 meters
- Cost per meter: $194
- Total cost: 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

For Lewis' street:
- Length: 490 meters
- Cost per meter: $194
- Total cost: 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street:
- Difference in cost: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

$65,960"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.
2. His research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it takes 50 months in total.
3. The first 5 months are already covered by the initial $100,000.
4. The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) cost 50% more per month than the initial funding.

First, let's find out how much each of the remaining months cost:
- Initial monthly cost: $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month
- Increased monthly cost: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the remaining 45 months:
- Total cost for 45 months: 45 months * $30,000 per month = $1,350,000

Finally, let's add the initial $100,000 to the cost of the remaining 45 months:
- Total cost: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

So, the total cost of John's research is:

$1,450,000"
"Let's break it down:

- The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
- The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces.
- The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.
- The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, add up all the meat:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many days are in March. March has 31 days. If each of the 1000 members posts 3 posts every day, we can calculate the total number of posts for March like this:

1. First, find out how many posts are made by all members in one day: 1000 members * 3 posts/member = 3000 posts/day.
2. Then, multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March: 3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93000 posts.

So, the total number of posts in March is 93000.

"Okay, let's break this down. Gary does laundry twice a week, so that's 2 loads per week. Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 2 loads, he uses 40 gallons of water each week.

Now, a gallon of water costs $0.15. So, for 40 gallons, the cost is 40 gallons * $0.15 per gallon = $6.00 per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total cost for the year is $6.00 per week * 52 weeks = $312.00.

So, Gary spends $312.00 on water for laundry in a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, in one day, he sells:

15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

The bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat he sells in a day:

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's figure out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so:

4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so:

1/4 * 72 seats = 18 seats

This means there are 72 - 18 = 54 seats left for parents and students.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so:

1/3 * 54 seats = 18 seats

This leaves 54 - 18 = 36 seats for the students.

So, the number of students in the auditorium is 36.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:

24 street lights/intersection * 4 intersections = 96 street lights

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

96 street lights - 20 street lights = 76 street lights

For the second DVD:
1000 - 135 = 865 times left

Now, add the times left for both DVDs:

"Let's break it down:

- Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours at school. Since school lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.
- He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum chewed by the end of the day.
- Starting with 20 pieces, after chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.
- He then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.
- This leaves Jim with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

200 * 4 = 800
800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers have bloomed in Arianna's garden.

"To figure out Ashley's internet speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Then, convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

Step 1: Convert kb per second to kb per hour.
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download 20 kb/second * 3600 seconds = 72,000 kb.

Step 2: Convert kb per hour to Mb per hour.
- Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the total kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb.
- 72,000 kb / 1000 = 72 Mb.

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb.

"Okay, let's break this down. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for three days, that's 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars. For the remaining four days, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day, so that's 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars each day. For four days, that's 6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars. Adding the cars from the first three days and the last four days together, we get 30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to know how many inches tall he needs to be. Since the requirement is 4 feet, and there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 by 12 to get 48 inches. Adam is currently 40 inches tall, so he needs to grow 8 more inches to reach 48 inches. Since Adam grows 2 inches a year, we divide the 8 inches he needs to grow by the 2 inches he grows each year. 

8 divided by 2 equals 4.

"To figure out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost the company paid to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

First, the total sales amount:
10 cars * $25,000 each = $250,000

Next, the cost to acquire the cars:
30% of $250,000 = 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000

Now, the profit:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Finally, James's commission:
10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500.

$17,500"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:
   25% of 100 riders = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

2. Next, we know that 60% of these riders who stay upright are women. So, we calculate the number of women:
   60% of 25 riders = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women

3. To find the number of men who stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who stay upright:
   25 riders - 15 women = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, the price of a silver jewel is:
   \[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

Now, to find the total number of stamps, we add up all the stamps:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

So, Max bought 45 stamps in all.

"To figure out how long it'll take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to look at how much faster Tom is going compared to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. So, Tom is going 15 miles per hour faster than Bob.

This means every hour, Tom closes the gap by 15 miles. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we divide the distance by the speed difference to find out the time it takes for Tom to catch up.

75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours

Now, if Manny misses some classes, the cost per class he does attend will go up. We need to find out how many he can miss before the cost per class he attends hits $10.

If he misses 1 class, he attends 9 classes. The cost per class would then be $60 divided by 9, which is about $6.67. That's still under $10.

If he misses 2 classes, he attends 8 classes. The cost per class would be $60 divided by 8, which is $7.50. Still under $10.

If he misses 3 classes, he attends 7 classes. The cost per class would be $60 divided by 7, which is about $8.57. Still under $10.

If he misses 4 classes, he attends 6 classes. The cost per class would be $60 divided by 6, which is $10. That's exactly the limit.

If he misses 5 classes, he attends 5 classes. The cost per class would be $60 divided by 5, which is $12. That's over the limit.

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class he attends goes over $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples cost 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
5 oranges cost 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

So, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth, we can find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet by multiplying the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds

To make it easier to understand, we can convert seconds into minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:

216 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 3.6 minutes

But since the question asks for the final numerical answer in seconds, we'll stick with 216 seconds.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise. 

His original salary is $20,000 a month. A 5% raise on $20,000 is:
\[ 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

Next, we need to calculate his annual salary without the bonus. Since he earns $21,000 a month, his annual salary is:
\[ 21,000 \times 12 = 252,000 \]

Now, we need to add the bonus. The bonus is worth half a month's salary. Since his new monthly salary is $21,000, the bonus is:
\[ 21,000 \div 2 = 10,500 \]

Finally, we add the bonus to his annual salary:
\[ 252,000 + 10,500 = 262,500 \]

So, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

- Each dress shirt costs $60.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 = $7500
- Cost of dress pants: 10 pants * $150 = $1500

Next, we calculate how much Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday:
- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each.
- The total cost before the discount is 20 pomegranates * $30 = $600.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is 10% of $600 = $60.

"To figure out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, determine how many deviled egg halves are needed for 16 guests:
   - Each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves.
   - So, 16 guests will eat \( 16 \times 3 = 48 \) deviled egg halves.

2. Next, find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves:
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - So, to make 48 deviled egg halves, Lori needs \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) whole eggs.

3. Finally, convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   - 1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs.
   - So, 24 whole eggs is \( \frac{24}{12} = 2 \) dozens of eggs.

"To figure out how much James spent in the first year, we need to add up all his costs. 

1. The cost of the plane is a one-time expense: $150,000.
2. The cost to rent a hanger is $5,000 per month. For a year, that's $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.
3. The cost of fuel is twice the hanger rental, so it's $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. For a year, that's $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000

So, the total cost for the first year is $330,000.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cooking time for rice**: 30 minutes.
2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.
3. **Cooking time for beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. So, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food:
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

So, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
So, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

"To figure out how many sheep Lee has, we can use the information about the number of legs and heads. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Both have 1 head.

Let's say:
- \( S \) is the number of sheep.
- \( G \) is the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (sheep + geese) is 20.
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs (4 legs per sheep + 2 legs per goose) is 70.
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[
G = 20 - S
\]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
4S + 40 - 2S = 70
\]
\[
2S + 40 = 70
\]
\[
2S = 30
\]
\[
S = 15

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Roger normally buys coffee that costs $5 per pound.
2. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - 20% of $5 is $1.
   - So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.
3. Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound per day.
   - That means he buys 7 pounds of coffee.
   - 7 pounds of coffee at $6 per pound is 7 * $6 = $42.
4. Roger also buys a donut for $2.
5. The total cost is the cost of the coffee plus the cost of the donut.

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

Now, let's do the math:
600 - 198 = 402
402 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

"Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. The next three days included two good days and one neutral day. So, the total number of good days after these three days is 12 + 2 = 14 good days. Since the month has 33 days in total (30 days + 3 days), and we need to find out how many good days are left in the month, we subtract the 14 good days already accounted for from the total days in the month.

However, since the question asks for the number of good days left in the month, and we don't have information about the remaining days of the month, we can only confirm the good days that have occurred. The question seems to imply we should focus on the next three days only.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's start by understanding the changes Shania made. She extended the dress by 50% of its original length and then added an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \).

1. The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length before adding the lace trim is \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).
2. Then, 20 cm of lace trim was added to the bottom, making the final length \( 1.5x + 20 \).

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]
\[ 1.5x = 140 - 20 \]
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

"First, let's figure out the cost of the candies. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so five lollipops cost:

5 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

So, the four candies cost $1.20. To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30/candy

Now we know the cost of one lollipop is $0.40 and the cost of one candy is $0.30. To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we calculate:

10 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30/candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives us the total cost:

$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

Neil's monthly savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's monthly savings = 20 + 8
Neil's monthly savings = 28 coins

Now, let's calculate how many coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are 120 months.

Rong's total savings in 10 years = 20 coins/month * 120 months
Rong's total savings in 10 years = 2400 coins

Neil's total savings in 10 years = 28 coins/month * 120 months
Neil's total savings in 10 years = 3360 coins

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each type of fruit costs:
- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs $0.5 * 2 = $1.0.
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs $1.0 * 3 = $3.0.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate has 5 bananas, so the cost for bananas is 5 * $1.0 = $5.0.
- The crate has 12 apples, so the cost for apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.0.
- The crate has 7 oranges, so the cost for oranges is 7 * $3.0 = $21.0.

Finally, we add up the costs for all the fruits to get the total price of the crate:
- Total price = $5.0 + $6.0 + $21.0 = $32.0

"First, let's figure out how many points each student has:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty has:
   \[
   50 + (50 \times 0.30) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha has:
   \[
   35 \times 3 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the points:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her 3 children has 3 children of their own, so that's 3 children * 3 grandchildren = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so that's 9 grandchildren * 3 great grand-babies = 27 great grand-babies.

So, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is:

"First, let's figure out how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts in 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck, so that's:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

Next, let's calculate her car payment, which is 20% of her paycheck:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the retirement contribution and the car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, Greta has $720 left to spend.

"First, let's figure out how many fireworks the city will set off. They have 15 boxes, and each box has 20 fireworks. So, 15 boxes times 20 fireworks per box is 300 fireworks.

Hannah can see 40% of these fireworks. To find out how many that is, we take 40% of 300. That's 0.40 times 300, which equals 120 fireworks.

Hannah will also set off her own fireworks. She has 3 boxes, and each box has 5 fireworks. So, 3 boxes times 5 fireworks per box is 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city to the fireworks she sets off herself. That's 120 plus 15, which equals 135 fireworks.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people are in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So, the total number of people is:
13 + 7 = 20 people

Each person saves a seat, and each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. So, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks is:
20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks
20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the drinks and snacks. Each drink and snack costs $2, so:
40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Adding the cost of the drinks and snacks together gives us the total amount spent:
$80 + $120 = $200

So, the group has spent a total of $200 on snacks and drinks.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.
3. The total amount of gravel the three trucks can haul together is 11,600 pounds.

Now, let's add up what Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul:
4,000 (Gissela) + 4,800 (Gordy) = 8,800 pounds.

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the total amount Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul from the total amount all three trucks can haul:
11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
3. There are 8 males and 6 females.
4. The total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings.
5. The total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings.
6. The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 32 dumplings (males) + 18 dumplings (females) = 50 dumplings.

"First, we need to figure out how much money Gerald and Julia each got from the $100. The ratio is 3:2, which means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

The total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so he gets 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he has $60 - $10 = $50 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out. If Martha's cat can run 15 feet per second, and the cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, then the turtle runs at 15 feet per second divided by 5. That means the turtle runs 3 feet per second. 

Now, if the turtle runs 3 feet every second, in 40 seconds it would run 3 feet/second times 40 seconds. 

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The firefighters' goal is to raise $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. To find out how much more they need to raise, we subtract what they have already raised from their goal:
   \[
   6300 - 2100 = 4200
   \]
4. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so the amount they raise per hour is:
   \[
   2100 \div 3 = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]
5. To find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount they raise per hour:
   \[
   4200 \div 700 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
6. Adding the initial 3 hours to the additional 6 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:
   \[
   3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours}

"First, we figure out how much water Colorado City uses from the river, which is 40%. Then, we find out how much of that 40% is used for industrial purposes, which is 80%. So, 80% of 40% is used for industrial purposes.

To find this, we multiply 40% by 80%:
\[ 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]
This means 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial use from the total city use:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To figure out how many quarts of ice cream are made in 48 hours, we need to first find out how many quarts each type of ice cream can make in an hour and then multiply by 48.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours means 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours means 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we calculate how many quarts each type can make in 48 hours:
- Chocolate: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.
- Vanilla: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Adding these together gives the total quarts made in 48 hours:
- 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts.

So, Ginger has:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Now, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

"First, let's figure out how much James spent picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and then it's $1.5 per pound for 30 pounds. So, the cost for the blueberries is 30 pounds times $1.5 per pound, which is $45. Adding the $20 cost to go picking, the total cost is $45 + $20, which is $65.

Now, let's figure out how much it would cost to buy 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so 30 pounds times $2.5 per pound is $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store. So, $75 - $65 is $10.

"First, let's figure out how many students like to play music. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, and 5 students like to play basketball, then 10 students like to play music.

Now, let's add up the students with known hobbies:
- 10 students like to bake
- 5 students like to play basketball
- 10 students like to play music

That's a total of 25 students. Since there are 50 students in the class, the rest must like to play video games. 

So, 50 - 25 = 25 students like to play video games.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Jeremy saw 12 birds at first. He scared away 1/3 of them, so that's 12 divided by 3, which is 4 birds. So, 4 birds flew away. That leaves 12 - 4, which is 8 birds still in the backyard. Then, 20 more birds came to join the 8 that were left. So, 8 plus 20 is 28 birds. 

28"
"Okay, let's break this down. There are 80 students in total, and the two classes have the same number of students. So, each class has 40 students. Now, 40% of the students in each class are girls, which means 60% of the students are boys. 

To find out how many boys are in each class, we calculate 60% of 40 students:
60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

1. Mara starts with 2 slices on the plate.
2. She adds 3 more slices: 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
3. She triples the number of slices: 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
4. She eats 2 slices: 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
5. Her friend steals 5 slices: 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

So, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8.

"First, let's add up all the animals Melissa needs to groom this week:

8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day:

28 animals ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day

"First, let's figure out how much Mark spent on the packs of cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so:

3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards he got. He got one card worth $4000 and another worth $1000, so:

$4000 + $1000 = $5000

He also got 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50, so:

30 cards * $50/card = $1500

Now, let's add the value of all the cards together:

$5000 + $1500 = $6500

To find out the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

$6500 - $5400 = $1100

So, the profit Mark made is:

$1100"
"Let's break this down step by step.

First, we calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $26 = $52.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $12 = $24.
- So, the total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $14 = $28.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $10 = $20.
- So, the total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

Now, we find out how much they save by choosing the second amusement park:
- The savings is $76 - $48 = $28.

So, they will save $28 by choosing the second amusement park.

"Okay, let's figure this out. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. 

- With the old vendor, each tomato cost $0.5, so the daily cost was 500 * $0.5 = $250.
- With the new vendor, each tomato costs $0.4, so the daily cost is 500 * $0.4 = $200.

The savings per day is $250 - $200 = $50.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly savings would be $50 * 7 = $350.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles.

Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, Cal must have twice as many marbles as Sean. So, Cal has:
56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Next, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, Carl has:
56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:
224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

"To figure out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break it down:

1. First, calculate the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends in one week.
2. Then, multiply that by the number of weeks in two months.

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

For weekdays:
- 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs/week

For weekends:
- 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs/week

Total chairs rented in one week:
- 300 chairs + 200 chairs = 500 chairs/week

There are 8 weeks in two 4-week months.

Total chairs rented in two months:
- 500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"Okay, so Jenna has 4 roommates, which makes 5 people in total sharing the electricity bill. The bill is $100 each month. 

First, we need to find out how much each person pays per month. We divide $100 by 5 people:
$100 / 5 = $20 per person per month.

Now, to find out how much each person pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 months:
$20 * 12 = $240 per person per year.

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.

"First, let's figure out how many glasses and plates Jeff originally sent.

- 8 dozen glasses means 8 x 12 = 96 glasses.
- 4 dozen plates means 4 x 12 = 48 plates.

Now, let's subtract the broken items:

- 96 glasses - 10 broken glasses = 86 glasses.
- 48 plates - 6 broken plates = 42 plates.

So, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, she has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27).

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, she has 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, she has 60 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 63 small buttons.
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons.

So, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's break this down. If the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against, we can say that for every vote against, there are two votes in favor. This means the votes can be divided into 3 equal parts (1 part against and 2 parts in favor).

Since there are 33 people on the council, we divide 33 by 3 to find out how many votes were against the regulation:
33 / 3 = 11 votes against.

Since the votes in favor are twice the votes against, we multiply the number of votes against by 2:
11 * 2 = 22 votes in favor.

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

4. **Large (L):** Half as many as M, so 18 / 2 = 9 students
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more than L, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, let's add them all up:

- XS: 11

"Let's break this down step by step. 

1. Let the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house be \( x \).
2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, so it will need \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
3. The third house needs double what the first house needs, so it will need \( 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ x + 4x = 500 \]

\[ 5x = 500 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{500}{5} \]

\[ x = 100 \]

So, the third house will need \( x \) cases, which is 100 cases.

- Additional daily pay: $5
- Total for Monday: $75 + $5 = $80

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she doesn't get the extra $5. So, her earnings for Wednesday are:
- Hourly wage: 2 hours * $15/hour = $30

"First, let's figure out the total time Tatiana has over the weekend. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so that's 12 hours in total.

Next, we know she reads for 3 hours. So, we subtract the reading time from the total time:
12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours left for other activities.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. So, we calculate 1/3 of 9 hours:
1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours for video games.

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time:
9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours left for soccer.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
( Time spent on soccer / Total time available ) * 100

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, the total driving time is:
2 hours (to the museum) + 2 hours (back home) = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum:
4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

"First, let's figure out how many movies are in series. Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in series, so:

600 / 3 = 200 movies are in series.

These 200 movies cost $6 each, so the total cost for the series movies is:

200 * 6 = $1200.

Now, we have 600 - 200 = 400 movies left that are not in series.

Of these 400 movies, 40% are older movies, so:

400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies.

The older movies cost $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is:

160 * 5 = $800.

The remaining movies are normal movies, so we have:

400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.

The normal movies cost $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is:

240 * 10 = $2400.

Now, we add up all the costs:

"To find out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot was, we need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours in total.
- They hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
- They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = \(4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles per hour} = 225 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked:
- They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half their driving speed is \(50 \div 2 = 25\) miles per hour.
- Their hiking speed is \(25 - 5 = 20\) miles per hour.
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- Distance hiked = \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles per hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance to the vacation spot:

   - Points for enemies: 
     - Emma: \( 10E \)
     - Ava: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)

2. **Berries Collected:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - If Emma collects \( B \) berries, then Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points for berries:
     - Emma: \( 5B \)

3. **Time Left on the Timer:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - If Emma finishes with \( T \) seconds left, then Ava finishes with \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points for time:
     - Emma: \( 30T \)
     - Ava: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

Now, let's calculate the total scores for both Ava and Emma:

First, let's find the total distance Andy drives each week. He drives to work and back home from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days a week. Each one-way trip is 5 miles, so a round trip is 10 miles.

Total distance per week = 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas he uses each week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon.

Gallons of gas used per week = Total distance per week / Fuel efficiency
Gallons of gas used per week = 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons/week

Now, we calculate the cost of the gas he uses each week. The price of gas is $3 per gallon.

Cost of gas per week = Gallons of gas used per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas per week = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week.

"First, let's figure out how much money Carrie has in total from the twenties and the quarters.

She has ten twenties, so:
10 * $20 = $200

She also has 140 quarters, and since each quarter is worth $0.25, we have:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Now, let's calculate how much she spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of the twenties, we do:
3/5 * $200 = $120

So, the total amount she spent is the sum of the quarters and the part of the twenties:
$35 + $120 = $155

The total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

For the tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- So, the total number of tomatoes is 22 tomatoes/plant * 5 plants = 110 tomatoes.

For the eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is 4 eggplants/plant * 8 plants = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we first need to figure out how many smart TVs and analog TVs were sold, and then subtract that from the total number of TVs sold.

1. Smart TVs make up one-fourth of the sales. So, the number of smart TVs sold is:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

2. Analog TVs make up one-eighth of the sales. So, the number of analog TVs sold is:
   \[ \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

3. The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. To find this, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
   \[ 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"First, let's figure out what the temperature is at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we subtract 33 from 45:

45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to get the temperature up to at least 32 degrees. The difference between the night temperature and the freezing point is:

32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, Carson needs to burn:

20 / 5 = 4 logs.

"First, we need to figure out how many groups were formed. Since there were 90 people and each group had 9 people, we divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups:
\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \text{ groups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ groups} \]

Each of these 6 groups had 9 people, and each person brought back 2 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought back by each group is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ seashells per group} \]

Since there are 6 groups, the total number of seashells brought back is:
\[ 6 \times 18 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:
108"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The train starts with 172 people.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
   172 - 47 = 125 people.
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
   125 + 13 = 138 people.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
   138 - 38 = 100 people.

So, the final number of people on the train is 100.

10 bottle caps/day * $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50/day

Now, to find out how much he makes in a 30-day month, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

$2.50/day * 30 days = $75.00

So, in a 30-day month, Damien makes:

$75.00"
"First, let's figure out how much Jamie earns for her regular 8 hours of work. She earns $20 per hour, so for 8 hours, she earns:

\[ 20 \times 8 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate her pay for the extra hours. She worked 11 hours in total, so the extra hours are:

\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Her special hourly rate for these extra hours is 150% of her regular rate. So, her special hourly rate is:

\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For the 3 extra hours, she earns:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the pay for her regular hours and the extra hours to find her total pay for the day:

\[ 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid 250 dollars for her work that day.

"To figure this out, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **New employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3
4. **Salary per employee per month**: $4000

First, calculate the total number of new employees hired in 3 months:
20 new employees/month * 3 months = 60 new employees

Next, calculate the total number of employees after 3 months:
200 initial employees + 60 new employees = 260 employees

Now, calculate the total salary paid to all employees in one month:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

Finally, calculate the total salary paid over 3 months:
$1,040,000/month * 3 months = $3,120,000

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

$3,120,000"

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Billy's Starting Salary**: $10 per hour.
2. **Billy's First Raise**: After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour. So, his new rate is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **Billy's Second Raise**: On his first anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 per hour. So, his new rate is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much Billy earns in 20 hours:
- Billy's hourly rate is $11.50.
- For 20 hours, Billy earns $11.50 * 20 = $230.

4. **Sally's Starting Salary**: Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
- Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour.
- So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much Sally earns in 20 hours:
- Sally's hourly rate is $10.50.
- For 20 hours, Sally earns $10.50 * 20 = $210.

Finally, let's find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally:
- Billy earns $230.
- Sally earns $210.
- The difference is $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy earns $20 more than Sally.

"To figure out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many students there are in total:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
So, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
So, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Now, we add the trees planted by students and teachers:
- Trees planted by students: 1000 trees
- Trees planted by teachers: 240 trees

Total trees planted = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

"To figure out how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to find out how many stuffed animals she has in total right now. 

She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these up:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let's say Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. After buying the goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. So, the number of stuffed goats \( x \) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals \( 14 + x \).

This can be written as:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

To isolate \( x \), subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the following week:
- She plays for 2 hours each day, so in 7 days, she plays \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both periods:
- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the hours she still needs to play are:
- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

   - Total number of students: 500

2. **Fourth-graders:**
   - Number of students who passed: 40
   - Total number of students: 100

3. **Fifth-graders:**
   - Pass rate of fourth-graders: 40/100 = 0.4 (or 40%)
   - Pass rate of fifth-graders: 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 (or 80%)
   - Number of students who passed: 0.8 * 400 = 320
   - Total number of students: 400

Now, let's add up the totals:

- Total number of students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700
- Total number of students: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Finally, the overall pass rate is:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.7 \]

   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Since there are 2 worse friends, total quarters used by worse friends: \( 24 \text{ quarters/friend} \times 2 \text{ friends} = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - They can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so 30 minutes per quarter.

"To figure out how much oil Tanya uses, let's break down the information:

1. Let's say the amount of citrus zest and fragrance she uses is \( z \) ounces each.
2. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, and twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt and sugar is \( 2z \) ounces each.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \) ounces.

Now, we know the total mixture fills a 10-ounce jar, so we can set up the equation:

\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):

\[ z = 1 \]

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"First, let's figure out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages, and each package has 11 tins. So, 8 times 11 is 88 tins of cat food.

Next, let's find out how many tins of dog food she bought. She bought 6 packages, and each package has 6 tins. So, 6 times 6 is 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food she bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food. So, 88 minus 36 is 52.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, let's say PJ has \( x \) cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, let's find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3x = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break it down:

- Cindy had 5 green eggs.
- She had twice as many blue ones as green ones, so that's 2 times 5, which equals 10 blue eggs.
- She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so that's 10 - 1, which equals 9 pink eggs.
- She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 9 divided by 3, which equals 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them all up:

5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27 eggs

"To figure out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping and the refund she will get from Amazon.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
- The shipping cost for weight is 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40.
- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
- The shipping cost for distance is 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60.
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund:
- The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
- The refund amount is $32 * 0.75 = $24.

Now, let's find out how much Milly will lose:
- The amount Milly paid for the book is $32.
- The refund she will get is $24.
- The shipping cost is $3.00.
- The total amount Milly will lose is $32 - $24 + $3.00 = $11.00.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. 

- The first week, he produces 8,000 bars.
- The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so that's 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
- The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so that's 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up what he has produced in the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.

Since he needs to produce 50,000 bars in total for the month, we subtract what he has already produced from the total:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"To figure out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to add up all the time she spends on different activities related to TikTok.

First, let's calculate the time she spends recording videos:
- She records 18 videos each week.
- Each video is 4 minutes long.
- So, 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes per week.

Next, let's convert the weekly video recording time to hours:
- 72 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1.2 hours per week.

Now, let's add the time she spends writing songs:
- She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.

Then, let's calculate the time she spends doing her makeup:
- She spends 15 minutes six days a week.
- 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes per week.
- Convert this to hours: 90 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1.5 hours per week.

Now, let's add up all the time she spends on TikTok activities each week:
- Video recording: 1.2 hours
- Writing songs: 2 hours
- Doing makeup: 1.5 hours
- Total per week: 1.2 + 2 + 1.5 = 4.7 hours per week.

Finally, let's calculate the total time for a month with four weeks:
- 4.7 hours per week * 4 weeks = 18.8 hours.

So, Britany spends 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month with four weeks.

"To figure out how much Angela will pay, let's break it down:

1. The base installation cost is $129.00.
2. This base cost includes:
   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves (Angela doesn't need these)
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 extra)
- 2 chandeliers (1 extra)
- 20 pictures (10 extra)

The extra items are:
- 2 extra mirrors
- 1 extra chandelier
- 10 extra pictures

Each extra item costs $15.00, so:
- 2 extra mirrors = 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier = 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures = 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total extra cost = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, add the base cost to the extra cost:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

So, the total cost for Angela is $324.00.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more, we calculate 40% of $30.00:
   40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.
4. So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

Now, we need to convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

480 inches / 12 inches per foot = 40 feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Okay, let's think this through. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, then the total time for one kangaroo to cross would be the same, because they're all traveling at the same speed and we're assuming they're crossing together.

Now, if a turtle is traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it means it will take twice as long for a turtle to cover the same distance. So, if a kangaroo takes 18 hours, a turtle will take 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours.

Since we have 4 turtles, and they're all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for all 4 turtles to cross the highway together is still 36 hours, just like it would be for one turtle.

So, the final answer is:

"To find out the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first figure out how much of each glue stick is left and then add those amounts together.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. So, the length left is:

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. So, the length left is:
   \( 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \) millimeters.

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. So, the length left is:
   \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the remaining glue from each stick:

"To figure out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original amount.

Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

So, the interest earned over 3 years is:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]

However, the rate should be a fraction of the principal, not a dollar amount. The correct rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) or 0.75.

So, the correct interest calculation is:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 675 \]

Now, add the interest to the original amount to get the total:
\[ \text{Total} = 300 + 675 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 975 \]

   - Red cars + Green cars + Blue cars = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
5. Now, subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars:
   - Yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23

So, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, let's say:
- Fawn has \( F \) books.
- Anne has \( F - 12 \) books (since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn).
- Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books (since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne).

Together, they have 85 books, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + ((F - 12) + 25) = 85 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ F + F - 12 + F - 12 + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 3F - 12 - 12 + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 3F - 24 + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"First, we need to figure out how much the bag of sweet potatoes weighed. Since it weighed 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes, and the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much the bag of carrots weighed. The carrots weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 from the weight of the sweet potatoes: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

"To figure out how much Greg will spend on jello, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs in total. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups:
   30 kids * 4 jello cups per kid = 120 jello cups

2. Next, we need to determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 jello cups. Since one box makes 10 jello cups:
   120 jello cups / 10 jello cups per box = 12 boxes

3. Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $1.25, so:
   12 boxes * $1.25 per box = $15.00

So, Greg will spend $15.00 on jello.

"First, we need to figure out how much Madeline pays and how much Keenan pays in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400, we calculate:

Madeline's share: 60% of $400 = 0.60 * $400 = $240

The total cost is $400, so Keenan's share is the remaining amount:

Keenan's share: $400 - $240 = $160

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly share by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in the month):

Keenan's weekly share: $160 / 4 = $40

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces on the first day. So, we calculate:
2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces

After the first day, the remaining pieces are:
60 - 24 = 36 pieces

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, the remaining pieces after the second day are:
36 - 10 = 26 pieces

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. So, we calculate:
7/13 * 26 = 14 pieces

Now, let's add up all the pieces he has eaten so far:
24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48 pieces

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far.

"First, let's figure out the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

For soda:
7 bottles cost $21.00, so 1 bottle costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

For water:
4 bottles cost $8.00, so 1 bottle costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3 bottles of soda cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
2 bottles of water cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

So, the total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

"To figure out how many points Amy scores, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and then add them all up.

1. **Multiple-Choice Questions:**
   - There are 10 multiple-choice questions.
   - Amy answers 80% of them correctly.
   - So, she gets \(10 \times 0.80 = 8\) questions correct.
   - Each correct multiple-choice question is worth 1 point.
   - Therefore, she scores \(8 \times 1 = 8\) points from multiple-choice questions.

2. **True/False Questions:**
   - There are 20 true/false questions.
   - Amy answers 90% of them correctly.
   - So, she gets \(20 \times 0.90 = 18\) questions correct.
   - Each correct true/false question is worth 1 point.
   - Therefore, she scores \(18 \times 1 = 18\) points from true/false questions.

3. **Long-Answer Questions:**
   - There are 5 long-answer questions.
   - Amy answers 60% of them correctly.
   - So, she gets \(5 \times 0.60 = 3\) questions correct.

"To find out how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them:

\[ 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 each:

\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he spent to buy the chickens, we subtract the profit from the total revenue:

\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000.

"First, we need to find out how many glasses the boys sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and they sold 32 glasses in total, the boys together sold:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, each of them sold:

18 / 2 = 9 glasses

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's figure out how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope. She has a rope that is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total money she will get is:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, Sarah wants to buy a new rope with this money. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total money by the cost per meter:

$40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters (approximately)

Since she can't buy a fraction of a meter, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Now, to find out how much money she will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money she got from selling her old rope:

$40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out how old she is now, we subtract 10 from 18:
18 - 10 = 8
So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old. Since she is currently 8 years old, we subtract her current age from 24:
24 - 8 = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's figure out the cost of each item Kelly is buying.

- The total cost for 5 packs of bacon is $10, so each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.
- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:

- The total cost for 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.
- The total cost for 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
- The total cost for 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Total cost for bacon: $10
- Total cost for chicken: $24
- Total cost for strawberries: $12
- Total cost for apples: $14

The total cost for all items is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly’s budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left is $65 - $60 = $5.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first subtract the time of the encore from the total time of the final concert. The final concert is 65 minutes long, and the encore is 15 minutes. So, the main part of the final concert is:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we divide the main part of the final concert by 2 to find the length of her usual concerts:

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

Now, to find out how many they make in total over those three days, we add them up:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500

So, the total number of chimichangas they make on those three days is 500.

4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:
40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

Two-thirds of these 75 plants are outdoor plants, so 2/3 * 75 = 50 outdoor plants.

This leaves us with 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we take the number of flowering plants and divide it by the total number of plants, then multiply by 100. So, (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

"To figure out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

1. We know Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
2. The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's. If Joe's lawn was mowed once, Kamala's was mowed 3 times.
3. The second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's. If Joe's lawn was mowed once, Alba's was mowed 5 times.

Let's assume Joe's lawn was mowed once each week. So:
- First week: Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times.
- Second week: Joe's lawn 1 time, Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 1 + 1 = 2 times
- Kamala's lawn: 3 times
- Alba's lawn: 5 times

If Joe paid $6 for his lawn, and assuming the rate is the same for all lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 2 times * $6 = $12
- Kamala's lawn: 3 times * $6 = $18
- Alba's lawn: 5 times * $6 = $30

Total earnings from mowing lawns:

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, and everyone eats one bowl at a meal, we need to figure out how much soup is left after dinner.

First, let's see how much soup is used for dinner:
- Calvin (1 adult bowl)
- His wife (1 adult bowl)
- Two children (2 child bowls)

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total soup used for dinner is:
- 1 adult bowl + 1 adult bowl + 2 child bowls = 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls

Converting everything to child bowls:
- 2 adult bowls = 4 child bowls
- 4 child bowls + 2 child bowls = 6 child bowls

So, 6 child bowls of soup are used for dinner. The pot originally had 8 child bowls of soup, so the leftover soup is:
- 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls

Each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will get 1 bowl.

"To figure out how much material Jo needs, let's break it down:

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs 2/4 = 0.5 yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs 2.25/3 = 0.75 yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards of material.

Now, add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

Next, we know that eight years ago, Duncan's age (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's call Adam's age four years ago ""A"". So we have:
52 = 2 * A

To find A, we divide both sides by 2:
A = 52 / 2
A = 26

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 years to 26:
26 + 4 = 30

Now, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
30 + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"First, let's figure out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm is. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. So, twice Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres times 2, which is 400 acres. Then, add 100 acres to that, so 400 acres plus 100 acres is 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, to find out how many acres both farms have together, we add Farmer Brown's 200 acres to Farmer Smith's 500 acres. So, 200 acres plus 500 acres is 700 acres.

"First, we need to figure out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, that means he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in a full eight-hour workday. If he completes 40 packages per hour, then in 8 hours he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns. If he gets paid $0.20 for every package, then for 320 packages, he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64.

"Okay, let's break this down. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, so he drinks 1 bottle for the first 30 minutes and another half bottle for the next 15 minutes. That's 1.5 bottles for a normal Sudoku.

An extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal one, so that's 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes. 

Now, 180 minutes is 3 hours. Since he drinks a bottle every half hour, in 3 hours he would drink 3 * 2 = 6 bottles.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon. Since there are 20 red balloons, he threw:
2 pieces/balloon * 20 balloons = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. So, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
58 pieces - 40 pieces = 18 pieces.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. To find out how many yellow balloons there are, we divide the total pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces per yellow balloon:
18 pieces / 3 pieces/balloon = 6 yellow balloons.

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

6"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so that's 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles in a month. His car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, so in 3000 miles, he would need 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours. 

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he worked on Tuesday, which means he works 5 * 2 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Adding up the hours from all three days, Bruce works 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, sold at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 sets of 2 balloons
   - 6 sets * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, each at $7, is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice cream: $14
- Total: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they had the same amount of allowance, we can find out how much each one had by dividing the total by 2:
- $28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"First, let's figure out how many students are playing volleyball. Since there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, that means there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, let's add up all the students:
- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: 16 boys + 22 girls = 38 students

So, the total number of students is 6 + 12 + 38 = 56.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops were sold in total. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to find out how much the class spent to buy the lollipops. Each lollipop cost $0.5:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise:
\[ \$90 \]

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total pets: 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"First, let's figure out how many cups are used for the cinnamon tea. Lana uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea, so we subtract these from the total number of cups she has:

27 cups - 15 cups = 12 cups

These 12 cups are divided into 3 rows, with each row having equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. So, each row has:

12 cups / 3 rows = 4 cups per row

Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

4 cups per row / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea per row

"First, we need to figure out how much water Anthony and his father put into the tank. They filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10000 gallons, half of that is:

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

500 * 6 = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find out how much is left:

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

So, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

"Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's calculate how much Colby has spent so far:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so he has:
$150 - $130 = $20 left.

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy:
- Movie ticket on Friday: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Box of candy: $2

Total cost for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

Since he has exactly $20 left, he can afford to see one more movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy.

So, the total number of movies he can see this month is:
5 (Fridays or Saturdays) + 8 (other days) + 1 (last Friday) = 14 movies

"To find out how many calories the pastries Andrew baked have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin.
3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- So, a mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- So, a mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.

Now, let's find the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

Next, let's find the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- Each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40,000
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45,000
- Total calories from all pastries: \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \) calories.

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

Now, let's add these numbers together:

39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

Next, we divide the total by the number of days (5):

300 / 5 = 60

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60.

"To figure out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each one traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the other toys and then subtract that number from the total number of toys.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

First, we add these numbers together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, we know the total number of toys is 62. To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the number of other toys from the total:
62 - 48 = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say John's age is \( J \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and John's ages, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, we can find the ages:
- John's age \( J = 20 \)
- Paul's age \( J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \)
- Peter's age \( 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \)

So, Peter's age is 50.

- Maria has 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (including Maria).
- At the start, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends × 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
- Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
- So, at the start, they had 8 + 1 = 9 balloons.

- Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, that's 5 people × 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

- Adding the balloons from the start and the ones given by Maria's mom, the total number of balloons is 9 + 15 = 24.

- Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's total distance:
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- She spits each seed 12 feet.
- Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Next, we find the total distance for both:
- Total distance for both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

Now, we find the average total distance:
- Average total distance = Total distance for both / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

"To figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then find out how much money that would be.

First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 60
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 45
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets:

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Total widgets: 43,200
   - Price per widget: $6
   - Total revenue: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Total widgets: 32,400
   - Price per widget: $6
   - Total revenue: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000:

- Difference in revenue: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours, he pays 70 pesos per hour.

So, the cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

The total cost for Cameron is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, it would have cost him 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:

"First, let's figure out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, twice the amount each goat needs is 10 pounds (2 * 5), and 3 pounds less than that is 7 pounds (10 - 3).

Now, let's calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds, so the total for the goats is 75 pounds (15 * 5).

Next, let's calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds, so the total for the sheep is 84 pounds (12 * 7).

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep together to get the total amount of hay Nate needs. So, 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - He rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - He swims at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time for the first part, the rest time, and the time for the second part.
   - Total time is \( 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \) hours.

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the New York Times is 10% of $5, which is \( 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $15, which is \( 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal

"Let's break this down step by step. 

1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.
3. Let's say Azibo scored \( A \) points.
4. Then Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
5. Dinar scored \( A + 10 \) points.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total points:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out. If the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages to the inch, then we can find out how many pages are in the book by multiplying 100 pages by 1.5 inches.

100 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 150 pages

But since each sheet of paper has a page printed on both sides, the number of pages in the book is actually double the number of sheets. So, the book has 150 pages.

150"
"First, let's figure out how many minutes Vince was stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, that's 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Next, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15, which gives us 900 / 15 = 60 intervals.

Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

1800"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. That's 8 hours of sleep.
2. 8 hours is equal to 480 minutes.
3. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.
4. She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
5. From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes, which is 475 minutes.
6. Subtract the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking from the 475 minutes she was in bed.

475 - 23 = 452

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

"First, let's figure out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. If he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, then:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, if Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons left is:

16 - 6 = 10

Next, we need to find the total number of utensils remaining. This includes the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

Total utensils remaining = 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many beds are currently occupied. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:
1000 beds * 1/5 = 200 beds occupied

Next, we need to figure out how many patients are admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day:
50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we add the number of patients admitted to the number of beds already occupied:
200 beds occupied + 700 patients = 900 beds occupied

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:
1000 beds - 900 beds occupied = 100 unoccupied beds

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:
100"
"First, let's figure out how many emails are not work emails. Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of those are work emails. So, 16 - 7 = 9 emails are not work emails.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 emails are to family. Two-thirds of the 9 emails are to family, so 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.

Now, we have 9 - 6 = 3 emails left, which are not to family or work. One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend, so 1/3 * 3 = 1 email is to her boyfriend.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know Aliya is 3 years old. 

Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so:
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

"If Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but she overstated the number by 20%, we need to find out what 100% (the actual number) would be. 

First, we figure out what 1% is. Since 48 is 120% (100% + 20%), we divide 48 by 120 to get 1%:
\[ \frac{48}{120} = 0.4 \]

Now, to find 100%, we multiply 0.4 by 100:
\[ 0.4 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"Let's break this down step by step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2, so the net holes added on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes.

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes, so four times that is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes.

By the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes. Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
40 (total holes) - 29 (holes at the end of the third day) = 11 holes.

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Okay, so Jen needs $400 for supplies. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find out how much 50% of $400 is, we divide $400 by 2, which gives us $200. So, the travel tickets cost $400 plus $200, which is $600.

$600"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

1. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught \( A \) Pokemon.
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
3. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, let's find out how many Stan has caught:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To figure out the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance the bird traveled in each direction and then add or subtract these distances accordingly.

1. **First leg of the journey (south):**
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) miles

2. **Second leg of the journey (north):**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \times 18 = 36 \) miles

3. **Third leg of the journey (south):**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) miles

Now, we add the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

- Total distance south: \( 300 + 110 = 410 \) miles
- Total distance north: \( 36 \) miles

- Net distance: \( 410 - 36 = 374 \) miles

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

2. At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   - 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies

3. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her at the surprise party.
   - 4 dozen = 48 brownies

4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   - 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had initially:
- 12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the party) = 66 brownies

Next, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:
- 66 - 18 = 48 brownies

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. 25% of 8 is 2, so his sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages:
Nani: 8 years
Brother: 16 years
Sister: 6 years

Total age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30

2. For the 5 racquets with polyester string:
   - 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes

3. For the 4 racquets with hybrid sets:
   - 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

$600 / 2 = $300

For the two half-price phones, he pays:

2 phones * $300 = $600

Now, we add the cost of the full-price phones and the half-price phones together:

2 times the length plus 2 times the width:
2 * 15 + 2 * 10 = 30 + 20 = 50 feet

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes left.

Now, she keeps 1/4 of the oranges. Since she has 8 boxes left, we need to find out how many boxes 1/4 of 8 is.

1/4 of 8 boxes = 2 boxes.

So, she keeps 2 boxes and sells the rest. The rest would be:

8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sells is:

6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

$39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide $25 by $5:

On Saturday:
- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday:
- Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes, so on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each item over the two days:
- Total gingerbread sold: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie sold: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Next, let's calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6/box = $150

4. Emil will also be twice as old as his brother. So, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.
5. Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
6. Similarly, his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

4. Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
   \[
   \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ flights}
   \]

So, the number of flights to France is 11.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up the total time they howl:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total time = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
120 seconds / 60 = 2 minutes

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the total age of the children is 20. So, if we add up the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred, it should equal 20.

Akbar is 3 years old.
Alessandro is 4 years old.

So, the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro is:
3 + 4 = 7

Now, let's say Wilfred's age is \( W \) and Helene's age is \( H \).

The total age of the group is:
3 + 4 + \( W \) + \( H \) = 20

This simplifies to:
7 + \( W \) + \( H \) = 20

So:
\( W \) + \( H \) = 13

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4.

The average age is:
20 / 4 = 5

So, Helene's age \( H \) is:
\( H \) = 2 * 5 = 10

Now we can substitute \( H \) back into the equation \( W \) + \( H \) = 13:
\( W \) + 10 = 13

So:
\( W \) = 13 - 10
\( W \) = 3

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"First, let's add up what Walter has collected so far. He got $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. That's $500 + $1500 = $2000. Then his friend gives him $200 more, so now the total is $2000 + $200 = $2200. 

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2200 = $6600.

$6600"
"First, let's figure out how many cookies there were in total at the wedding. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can find out how many people were in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

"To figure this out, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \( x \).
2. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big, so each adult gets \( 2x \).
3. There are 4 kids, so the total for the kids is \( 4x \).
4. There are 2 adults, so the total for the adults is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).
5. The total watermelon is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults, which is \( 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:
- Each adult gets \( 2x \).
- The total watermelon is \( 8x \).

The percentage each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100 = \frac{2}{8} \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"First, let's figure out how much time Doctor Jones spends on his inpatients. He has 9 inpatients, and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient. So, 9 inpatients times 20 minutes each is 180 minutes, which is 3 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time for his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each takes 30 minutes. So, 10 appointments times 30 minutes each is 300 minutes, which is 5 hours.

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatients and appointments: 3 hours for inpatients plus 5 hours for appointments equals 8 hours.

Doctor Jones works for 9 hours in total. So, if he spends 8 hours on inpatients and appointments, he will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To figure out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake and then count backward from 5:00 pm.

- Making the batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time needed: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is 3 hours.

So, if Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake, she should start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To figure out the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to break down the costs and the number of sessions.

First, let's calculate the cost per session:
- The fixed cost to rent the studio is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students.
- So, the cost for the students per session is 10 students * $1.50/student = $15.

Adding the fixed cost and the cost for the students gives us the total cost per session:
- Total cost per session = $25 + $15 = $40.

Next, we need to find out how many sessions are held in a month. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week, so in a month, it's rented 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the month:
- Total cost for the month = 12 sessions/month * $40/session = $480.

However, the question asks for the expected earnings, which typically means the revenue. Since the problem doesn't specify any revenue (like what the students pay), we can only calculate the total cost, not the earnings. If you meant to ask about the total cost, then the answer is $480. If you need the earnings, we would need to know how much each student pays per session.

Since the problem doesn't provide the revenue, I'll assume you're asking for the total cost.

"To figure out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each has by the number of boxes they have.

For Peter:
- He has 64 chocolate bars in total.
- He has 4 boxes.
- So, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is 64 divided by 4, which is 16.

For Martha:
- She has 56 chocolate bars in total.
- She has 7 boxes.
- So, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is 56 divided by 7, which is 8.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:
- 16 (Peter's bars per box) - 8 (Martha's bars per box) = 8.

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"First, let's figure out how many female porcupines there are. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, which is 50. So, we calculate:

3/5 * 50 = 30 female porcupines

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, in one month, the total number of babies born is:

30 * 4 = 120 babies

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

120 * 12 = 1440 babies

Now, we add the number of babies born in a year to the original population to find the total population after a year:

50 + 1440 = 1490

"First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular shape, so we can find the volume by multiplying the length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company said to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.

Gallons = Volume × 5.9
Gallons = 1400 × 5.9
Gallons = 8260

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Gallons × $0.10
Cost = 8260 × $0.10
Cost = $826

So, it will cost $826 to fill the pool.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 9 red sticks.

Next, the number of blue sticks is 5 more than the red sticks. So, we add 5 to the number of red sticks:
9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.

Then, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, we subtract 3 from the number of blue sticks:
14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

Now, we add up all the sticks:
9 red sticks + 14 blue sticks + 11 yellow sticks = 34 sticks.

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34.

2. Students over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Students under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500

For students over 16:
- One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375
- Therefore, the number of female students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125

For students under 16:
- One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750
- Therefore, the number of female students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750

Total number of female students:

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
     - 1/4 of 18000 gallons = 18000 / 4 = 4500 gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
     - 3/4 of 4500 gallons = 4500 * 3/4 = 3375 gallons.

2. **Total water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda + Ms. B = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

3. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     - 2/3 of 4500 gallons = 4500 * 2/3 = 3000 gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.

"To figure out how much charge the power bank had when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the end.

1. **Final Charge:**
   - The power bank had 28% charge left at the end.

2. **Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank was losing 7% of its total capacity each hour.
   - Let's denote the charge before the last 3 hours as \( x \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% \) of the total capacity.
   - So, \( x - 21\% = 28\% \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 28\% + 21\% = 49\%
     \]

3. **First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour.
   - Let's denote the charge before the first 5 hours as \( y \).
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% \) of the total capacity.
   - So, \( y - 45\% = 49\% \).
   - Solving for \( y \):

Now, Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment. So, the down payment she needs is:

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs by the amount she makes in a week:

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, each large stuffed animal costs $4 * 3 = $12.

Next, let's say Teresa sold \( x \) large stuffed animals. According to the problem, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.

The total money earned from selling the small stuffed animals is \( 2x \) small animals * $4 each = \( 8x \) dollars.

The total money earned from selling the large stuffed animals is \( x \) large animals * $12 each = \( 12x \) dollars.

The total money earned from all sales is $120, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, and she sold twice as many small ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 * 6 = 12 \]

1. **Substitute Teacher**: There's a 50% chance he'll have a sub who won't collect the homework. So, there's a 50% chance he won't have to turn it in because of the sub.

2. **Normal Teacher, No Extension for Class**: If the normal teacher is there (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension to the whole class. So, the chance she doesn't give an extension is 60%. 
   - The combined chance of the normal teacher being there and not giving an extension is 50% * 60% = 30%.

3. **Personal Extension**: If the normal teacher is there and doesn't give an extension to the class, there's still a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension.
   - The chance he doesn't get a personal extension is 80%.
   - The combined chance of the normal teacher being there, not giving a class extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 80% = 24%.

So, the total chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 24%.

100% - (50% + 30% - 24%) = 24%

"First, we need to find out how many seats are left for friends and family after accounting for the graduates and faculty. 

Total seats: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Seats left for friends and family: 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750

Now, we need to divide these seats equally among the graduates.

Number of graduates: 950

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so:
   75 large beans * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3:
   150 medium-sized beans * 3 = 450 small beans.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"First, let's figure out how much Melissa earns in total from her jury duty. She gets paid $15 per day and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \]

Next, let's calculate her total expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day, and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, let's find out her net earnings by subtracting her expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 - 9 = 36 \]

Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total number of hours she works is:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:

\[ 36 \div 18 = 2 \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses.

"To figure out how long it will take Richard, we need to first find out how many soda bottles he will place. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he places a bottle every 3 feet. 

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Now, Richard starts at the first bottle, so he doesn't need to move to get to it. But he needs to move from the first bottle to the second, the second to the third, and so on, until the last bottle. That means he will move 7 times.

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

So, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know there are forty apples in one box. Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, so we need to find out how many apples he has in total. 

40 apples/box × 2 boxes = 80 apples

Now, Uncle Franky wants to pack these apples with eight apples in each pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

80 apples ÷ 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"First, let's figure out how much Amor spends on the Parmesan cheese. She buys 2 pounds at $11 per pound, so that's 2 * 11 = $22.

Next, for the mozzarella cheese, she buys 3 pounds at $6 per pound, so that's 3 * 6 = $18.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the cheese: $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

"First, let's figure out how much Jim owes in loans. He gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the money Jim lost by not working during the 4 years he was in college. He was making $25,000 a year before college, so:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

Now, let's add the total amount of loans and the money lost from not working:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Jim's college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working, we divide the total amount by his new annual income:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, first, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces he needs. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric piece will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of the fabric piece will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, to find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply the length by the width:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's break this down step by step.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters. First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's letters:
425 / 5 = 85

Then we add 17 to that:
85 + 17 = 102

So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice Tuesday's letters:
102 * 2 = 204

Then we add 5 to that:
204 + 5 = 209

So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, we add up the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost and the average loss.

- Total amount lost: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\) dollars.
- Total amount won: \(11\) dollars.
- Net loss: \(21.5 - 11 = 10.5\) dollars.

Since he participated in 3 races, the average loss per race is:
\[ \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5 \]

So, the average loss per race is $3.50.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let the amount the first person took be \( x \).
2. The second person took \( x + 80 \).
3. The third person took twice what the second person took, so \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"Okay, let's break this down. First, we need to figure out how many days are in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 21 days.

Next, the painters worked for 3/8 of a day each day. To find out how many hours that is, we need to know how many hours are in a full day. A full day has 24 hours, so 3/8 of a day is:

\[ 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, each day, each painter worked 9 hours. Over 21 days, the total hours each painter worked is:

\[ 9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in 189 hours of work.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

1. Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is \( x \).
2. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

We know the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, let's combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory retrieved 6 balls. 

Now, let's find the number of balls in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

1. First, calculate the depreciation factor: 1 - 0.21 = 0.79
2. The car was bought in 2007, and we need the price in 2010, which is 3 years later.
3. Use the formula for depreciation: 
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (\text{Depreciation Factor})^{\text{Number of Years}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3
   \]

4. Calculate \(0.79^3\):
   \[
   0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493
   \]

5. Now, multiply the initial price by the depreciation factor:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493 = 9860

60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72

So, the increased cost per month is:
$120 + $72 = $192

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so for 700 small coupons:

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.

First, calculate the cost for 2 pounds of butter with the promotion:
1.5 pounds * $4.00 = $6.00

"Maggie had $60 and spent a quarter of it, so she spent $60 / 4 = $15. Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza had $60 and spent one-third of it, so she spent $60 / 3 = $20. Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, Maggie and Riza have $45 + $40 = $85 left.

"Let's break it down. Mr. Robles has 315 bananas for a week, which means there are 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day for all three monkeys.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. The second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so that's 10 + 4 = 14 bananas a day.

So, the first and second monkeys together eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas a day.

That leaves 45 - 24 = 21 bananas a day for the third monkey.

"First, let's figure out how much Jenny spends on the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, and the price is $15 for a dozen (12 roses), we can calculate the cost for 15 roses.

12 roses cost $15, so 1 rose costs $15 / 12 = $1.25.

For 15 roses, the cost is 15 * $1.25 = $18.75.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which is 5 * $5 = $25.

The change she should get back is $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters she gets is $6.25 / $0.25 = 25 quarters.

"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the total sales for each item and then add them all together.

First, for the milkshakes:
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00

Next, for the burger platters:
9 burger platters * $11 each = $99.00

Then, for the sodas:
20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add all the totals together:
$33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

So, Terry makes $162.00 in total.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
   - First train arrives: 10 minutes
   - First train leaves: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Second train arrives: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed.
   - Time the second train stays: 20 / 4 = 5 minutes
   - Second train leaves: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Third train arrives: 65 + 60 = 125 minutes
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives.
   - Third train leaves: 125 minutes

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Fourth train arrives: 125 + 20 = 145 minutes

So, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

"Okay, let's figure this out. Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, she has saved:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

She needs 200 toothpicks in total, so she still needs:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

If she keeps saving 10 toothpicks each week, the number of weeks it will take her to save 80 more toothpicks is:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"First, let's figure out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, so:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid for it:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price of $2000. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid:

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

60 seconds * 60 minutes = 3600 seconds in one hour.
For 4 hours, it would be:
3600 seconds * 4 = 14400 seconds.

So, if 5 springs are making jellyfish for 14400 seconds, the total number of jellyfish would be:

"To figure out how much Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying the bananas in bunches to the cost of buying them individually.

First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny got in total. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas:
10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas

Now, let's calculate the cost if she bought the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80:
40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Next, let's find out how much she actually paid for the bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00:
10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of buying the bunches from the cost of buying the bananas individually:
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"Let's figure this out step by step. If Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can set up the problem like this:

Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of fence. Then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of fence. Together, they have 100 feet of fence, so:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To figure this out, first, we need to find out how much the crocodile grows in one year. If it grows 8 inches in 4 years, we divide 8 by 4 to get the growth per year.

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, if the crocodile grows 2 inches every year, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply 2 inches by 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To figure out how much Marcel earned, let's break down the sales:

1. **Total bikes sold:** 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold:** Half of 300 = 150 bikes
3. **BMX bikes sold:** 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes
4. **MTB bikes sold:** The rest of the bikes = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Now, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- **Price of one MTB:** $500
- **Price of one BMX:** Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- **Price of one Trekking bike:** $450

Earnings from each type:
- **Earnings from MTB bikes:** 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- **Earnings from BMX bikes:** 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- **Earnings from Trekking bikes:** 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings:
- Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

So, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

"First, let's figure out how many classes John has in a day. He has 6 normal classes plus 2 extra classes, so that's 8 classes a day.

Each class is 40 minutes long, so in one day, he spends:
8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

He goes to class for 5 days a week, so in a week, he spends:
320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes

Now, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. So for each day, he spends:
1600 minutes / 16 = 100 minutes

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, he spends:
100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes

Adding the extra learning time to his regular school time, he spends:
1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, so:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. Again, it bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height from the first bounce, so:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"Okay, let's think this through step by step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors had already taken half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the 270 kilograms must be the other half. This means the velociraptors also ate 270 kilograms.
3. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were 270 + 270 = 540 kilograms of meat left.
4. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is the other half. This means the T-Rex also ate 540 kilograms.
5. Therefore, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 540 + 540 = 1080 kilograms.

"First, let's figure out the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet

Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. So, the area of one of these walls is:
5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet

Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
40 square feet * 2 = 80 square feet

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost is:
12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. There are 8 sodas left, 2 of which are shaken.

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

2. **Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles, but with her current plan, she will only hike 7,500 miles. 

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day:
- **Additional miles needed:** 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

"To figure out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find out how many times it blinks in one minute. 

If the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, then in one minute it blinks:
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute

Now, to find out how long it will take to blink 459 times, we divide the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

"To figure out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how far it is one way. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, one way:

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, the total distance for one visit is:

\[ 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ 280 \, \text{miles/visit} \times 2 \, \text{visits/month} = 560 \, \text{miles/month} \]

"Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many toys the first four workers produce in one hour and then in their 10-hour shift.

- The first 2 workers produce 6 toys each per hour, so together they produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next 2 workers produce 4 toys each per hour, so together they produce 8 toys per hour.

So, the first four workers together produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate how many toys they produce in a 10-hour shift:
- 20 toys per hour * 10 hours = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in the 10-hour shift is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
- 380 toys (total produced) - 200 toys (produced by the first four workers) = 180 toys.

The fifth worker produced 180 toys in 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
- 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
1/4 * 60 = 15 pounds

Elijah also has another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
1/2 * 60 = 30 pounds

Now, let's add up the weights of all the dogs:
Kory’s dog: 60 pounds
Elijah’s first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah’s second dog: 30 pounds

60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is 105 pounds.

He buys 3 large bags, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. So, the total weight of M&M's is:
3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Since there are 30 M&M's in each ounce, the total number of M&M's is:
30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

If John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is:
900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

"To figure out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the way around the earth, we first need to know what half the circumference of the earth is. The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is:

40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Now, we know Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

First, let's figure out how many eggs Camden and Sarah each painted. If Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, we can set up the following equations:
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
- Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted:
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \] eggs.

Now, we know Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs, which totals 30 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
\[ \text{Total eggs} = 56 \]
\[ \text{Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah} = 30 \]
\[ \text{Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline} = 56 - 30 = 26 \]

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:
\[ \text{Eggs painted by Arnold} = \text{Eggs painted by Madeline} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Finally, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"First, we need to figure out how many boxes Nik will use. Since he has 200 crayons and each box holds 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get the number of boxes:
200 / 8 = 25 boxes

Next, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:
25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so:
200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Adding the weight of the boxes and the crayons together gives us the total weight in ounces:
200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of usable tree:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each 4-foot log, John cuts 5 planks:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Now, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries:

2. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.

3. She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. To find out how long it takes, we divide the distance by her speed: 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

4. Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk gives us the total time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has right now. We know that if he gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Current marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the current number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Current marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. We subtract 10 from the current number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this, we need to figure out the minimum temperature of the water from the second mug that would make the mixed water at least 40 degrees.

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of water from the second mug. The total volume of the mixed water is 5 ounces.

Let's call the temperature of the water from the second mug \( T \).

The formula to find the final temperature of the mixed water is:
\[ \text{Final Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \]

We know the final temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we start with:
- 50 cows
- 20 chickens

Next, we need to calculate how many cows and chickens are added over three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks is 21 days.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day for 21 days:
- 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day for 21 days:
- 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add these to the initial numbers:
- Total cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
- Total chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:
- Total animals: 470 + 230 = 700

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.

"First, let's figure out the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs would cost:

4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

Now, since he gets a 10% discount on the total cost, we need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the total cost:

10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

So the total cost after the discount is:

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Russell ordered 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels is:

4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00/bagel

So, the cost of each single bagel is $1.00.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we do:
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

This means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion:
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

To solve for x, we cross-multiply and divide:
3 * 18 = 2 * x
54 = 2x
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, let's add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens 240 eggs make:

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

This means there are 6 groups of 14 people. So, the number of men is:
5 men/group * 6 groups = 30 men

And the number of women is:

- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Number of individual sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.

- Number of sunflowers in bouquets per day = 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 individual sunflowers + 84 sunflowers in bouquets = 97 sunflowers.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
- Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

- So, 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days for large scenes.

For the medium-sized picture scenes:
- She can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
- So, 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days for medium scenes.

For the small-sized picture scenes:
- She can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.

   - To cover 100% of one person's daily energy needs, you need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5 bottles).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

2. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - The additional number of bottles needed is 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

So, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
2. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.
   - 3/4 of 8 is 6, so 6 babies are dressed in purple.
   - 1/4 of 8 is 2, so 2 babies are dressed in blue.

3. All the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows.
   - All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the 6 purple wearers wear bows, which is 2 purple wearers.

4. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
   - 2 blue-wearers + 2 purple wearers = 4 babies wearing bows.

5. We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.
   - Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple.

6. The percentage chance is:
   - (Number of purple wearers with bows / Total number of babies with bows) * 100
   - (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports last week: 5168
Reports on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports on Thursday and Friday: 2136

First, add the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract this total from the total number of reports received last week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. 

First, he sells half of it:
- Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters.
- He sold this for $50.

Next, he sells another 1/4 of the original land:
- 1/4 of 80 square meters is 20 square meters.
- He sold this for $30.

Now, let's calculate how much land he has left:
- He started with 80 square meters.
- He sold 40 square meters, leaving him with 40 square meters.
- He then sold another 20 square meters, leaving him with 20 square meters.

He then sells the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter:
- 20 square meters * $3/square meter = $60.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $60

Total money earned: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:
36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"First, let's figure out how many apartments are in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so:

60% of 400 is 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments.

So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's add up all the apartments John collects garbage from:
200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, and he gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. So, the total amount he makes in a week is:
1040 apartments * 3 collections/week * $0.40/collection = $1248.

"Let's break it down:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so that's 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so that's 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so that's 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so that's 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so that's 0 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced from year 5 to year 10:

50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + 800 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old) = 2350 fruits.

So, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's break this down step by step. 

1. Let's say the length of the blue rope is B centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is 4B centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is B + 7 centimeters.
4. The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37.

Now, let's solve for B:
- Combine like terms: 6B + 7 = 37
- Subtract 7 from both sides: 6B = 30
- Divide by 6: B = 5

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long. The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so:
- Red rope = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we know that after giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money.

3. Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
4. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
5. According to the problem, \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).

Let's solve for \( x \):

\[
15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
\]

\[
15 - x = 12
\]

\[
x = 15 - 12
\]

\[
x = 3
\]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister.

6. Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to their little sister.

\[
5 - 3 = 2
\]

Therefore, Ronnie is left with $2.

"Okay, let's break this down. The mural is half yellow, so that means half of the 12 pints is yellow. Half of 12 is 6, so 6 pints are yellow. That leaves 6 pints for the other three colors: red, white, and purple. Since these three colors are in equal amounts, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3.

So, 6 pints divided by 3 colors equals 2 pints per color.

The amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"First, let's figure out the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom is 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, to find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

- On Wednesday, she counts double the number from Tuesday, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 puffs.
- On Thursday, she counts double the number from Wednesday, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 puffs.
- On Friday, she counts double the number from Thursday, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 puffs.

Now, let's add up all the puffs she counted from Monday to Friday:

3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93

So, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is:

"First, let's figure out how many pods are in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size has 20% more pods.

20% of 100 pods is 20 pods, so the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

The special size box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many pods you get for $1, we divide the number of pods by the cost:

120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

3. Total goals scored in the match:
   - Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many girls and boys are on varsity.

- There are 12 girls, and one-third of them are on varsity. So, \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) girls are on varsity.
- There are 12 boys, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. So, \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) boys are on varsity.

Next, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
- \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) students are on varsity.

Now, we need to find out how many students are not on varsity. There are 24 students in total (12 boys + 12 girls).

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. Seven years from now, Colin will be \( C + 7 \) years old.
3. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, so Wendy's current age is \( 5(C + 7) \).

Now, let's look at the second part of the problem:
4. In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old.
5. At that time, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7) \).

Let's solve the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples.
3. He put one apple in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
4. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground.
5. He picked up the 5 apples, put 4 in his pocket, and threw 1 at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
6. Now, he has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground.
7. He picked up the 6 apples and put them all in his pocket.

So, he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in his pocket when he went home.

"To figure out how much Ali's order costs, first, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags he ordered. We do this by dividing the total weight of the coal by the weight of each bag:

850 kilos / 50 kilos per bag = 17 bags

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:
$306"
"To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break it down:

First, we need to find out how many slices of each type of pizza her friends will eat in total.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each friend eats 6 slices.
- With 6 friends, that's 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices of cheese pizza.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each friend eats 4 slices.
- With 6 friends, that's 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza.

Now, we need to find out how many whole pizzas that is:

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza has 12 slices.
- 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.
- 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 + 3 = 6

"Okay, let's think this through. Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. That means in one hour, 8 snowballs melt (since there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour).

So, in one hour, Jay actually ends up with:
20 (made) - 8 (melted) = 12 snowballs

To get 60 snowballs, we need to figure out how many hours it will take:
60 snowballs ÷ 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If Digimon had its 20th anniversary, that means it came out 20 years ago. John is 28 now, so 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. At that time, John was twice as old as Jim, so Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Now, 20 years later, Jim would be 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they got 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and received over the three days:

- Total bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
- Total bandages received: 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day is the sum of the bandages they started with, plus the bandages they received, minus the bandages they used.

Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day. Then:

\[ x + 150 - 91 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x + 59 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"First, let's figure out how much Jen earns from her hourly work. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily earnings are:
7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Her weekly earnings from her hourly work are:
$11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.5/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly work are:
$67.5/week * 4 weeks = $270

Since Jen had complete attendance, she also gets an additional $10 each week for 4 weeks:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

So, her total earnings for April are:
$270 + $40 = $310

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. That's 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, 3 times the number of people who came in the morning entered the restaurant. That's 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after a while) + 150 (evening) = 320

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320.

"Okay, let's break this down. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, that means she bought 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. So, she bought 2 * 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, that means she bought 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens.

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the red pens and the black pens together: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"First, let's figure out the cost of each bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so each bottle costs $600 / 10 = $60.

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. So, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the cognac. John buys 20 bottles at $90 each, so the total cost for the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends. The total cost is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees in total over the two days.

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, on the second day, he planted 1/4 more than the 40 he planted on the first day. That's 40 * 1/4 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, on the second day, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Adding the Lodgepole Pine trees from both days, he planted 40 + 50 = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.

In total, Mr. Julius planted 30 White Oak trees and 90 Lodgepole Pine trees, which adds up to 30 + 90 = 120 trees.

4. On the third day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons left.
5. On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, including Fred, so there were 3 people in total.

To find out how much root beer each person got, we divide the remaining 8 gallons by 3 people:

8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 gallons per person

So, each person had about 2.67 gallons of root beer.

Her sister steals one palette, which had 4 colors, so now she has 26 - 4 = 22 colors left.

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 colors used.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to account for the packing efficiency. The jelly beans only fill about 80% of the jar's volume, so the effective volume filled by the jelly beans is:

\[ 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans in the jar is:

3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30

Next, we need to calculate the new cost per visit after the 150% increase. A 150% increase means the new price is 250% of the original price. So, the new cost per visit is:

$2 * 250% = $2 * 2.5 = $5

Now, we calculate the cost for the next 3 years with the new price:

3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45

Finally, we add the costs from both periods to find the total amount Pauline spent:

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- So, the total cost for the roof frames is 2 frames * $10/frame = $20.

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece, being 4 times the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The longer piece is 32 feet long.

3. The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) is 10. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   c + (3c - 2) = 10
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   c + 3c - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4c - 2 = 10
   \]

5. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
   \[
   4c = 12
   \]

6. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
   \[
   c = 3
   \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount. The manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40. Together, that's $35 + $40 = $75. With a 20% discount, she saves 20% of $75, which is $75 * 0.20 = $15. So, the discounted price for both is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, for the nail art. She wants nail art on all her fingers, which means 10 nails. At $3 per nail, that's 10 * $3 = $30.

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure, we get $60 + $30 = $90.

"Let's break it down:

- Susan has 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. So, 3 magazines * 12 issues each = 36 issues.
- She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
- Her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, add them all up:
36 issues + 6 issues + 24 issues = 66 issues

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year.

66"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, in November, the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find out how much it increased, we calculate 80% of $40:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the price in December was:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find out how much it decreased, we calculate 50% of $72:
\[ 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price in January was:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is:

"Charlie charges $80 per hour for his standard lessons. For veterans, he charges 25% less, which means he charges 75% of $80. 

First, let's calculate the reduced rate for veterans:
75% of $80 = 0.75 * 80 = $60

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from the standard lessons:
4 lessons * $80 = $320

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from the veteran lessons:
2 lessons * $60 = $120

Finally, let's add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

60 * (2/5) = 24 apples

Now, let's see how many apples are left after he ate 24 of them:

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. So he gave her:

36 * (25/100) = 9 apples

Now, let's find out how many apples Walter has left after giving 9 to his sister:

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter then sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each, so the money he received is:

"To figure out what percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled.

1. **Calculate the total time Michael has been traveling:**
   - Michael travels for 3 days.
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, the total time is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) hours.

2. **Calculate the total distance Michael has traveled:**
   - Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr.
   - So, the total distance is \(50 \times 72 = 3600\) km.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the total distance covered:**
   - The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.
   - The percentage of the distance covered is \(\frac{3600}{6000} \times 100 = 60\%\).

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance.

"To figure out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break it down:

1. The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box.
2. The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
3. The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, so it's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up the costs for one week:
- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Gruyere cheese: $6.00

Total cost for one week: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
- Total cost for one year: $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

"First, let's figure out how many minutes the custodian works in a day. An 8-hour day is 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many classrooms the custodian can clean in a day. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the custodian can clean 480 minutes / 15 minutes/classroom = 32 classrooms per day.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent cleaning classrooms over the 5 days. The custodian has to clean 80 classrooms in 5 days, so they spend 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes cleaning.

To find out the average time spent cleaning per day, we divide the total cleaning time by the number of days: 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day.

Finally, to find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total minutes in a workday and multiply by 100: (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 50%.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books each.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each bookcase can hold:
- Middle shelves: 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total books per bookcase: 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:
110 / 55 = 2

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"First, let's figure out how much Rose spent on the eggs. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

5 dozens * $2.40 per dozen = $12.00

Now, let's find out how many eggs she has in total. Since one dozen is 12 eggs:

5 dozens * 12 eggs per dozen = 60 eggs

Next, we need to figure out how much she will sell the eggs for. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. So, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:

60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets

Now, we calculate how much she will earn from selling all the eggs:

20 sets * $1 per set = $20.00

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings:

$20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00.

- Remaining hats = 100 - 50 = 50

Now, 3/5 of these remaining hats are blue:
- Number of blue hats = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Finally, the rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:
- Number of white hats = 50 - 30 = 20

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test:
60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions

So, she needs to get 77 questions right in total and she already got 42 right. That means she needs to get:

"Let's figure this out step by step. If we call the number of strawberry cubes ""S,"" then the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times S minus 4. So, the total number of cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is S + (5S - 4). We know the total is 116 cubes.

So, we have:
S + (5S - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we get:
6S - 4 = 116

Now, add 4 to both sides:
6S = 120

Then, divide both sides by 6:
S = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes, we use the formula for blueberry cubes:
5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

So, the number of blueberry cubes is 96.

- Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's figure out the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each. So, 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles.
- Total candles = 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

2. **Distance on Land**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**: 
  - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
  - Distance on land = 100 yards
  - Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

- **Time in Water**:
  - Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
  - Distance in water = 100 yards
  - Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time for both parts of the journey to get the total time:

- **Total Time** = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"Okay, let's figure this out. If there are 10 2-legged animals, that means there are 10 * 2 = 20 legs from the 2-legged animals. For the 15 4-legged animals, that's 15 * 4 = 60 legs. So, in total, there are 20 + 60 = 80 legs. Since you asked for pairs of legs, we divide 80 by 2, which gives us 40 pairs of legs.

40"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 4 blue blocks. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so that means there are 8 yellow blocks.

Now, let's add the blue and yellow blocks together:
4 blue blocks + 8 yellow blocks = 12 blocks

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, to find out how many red blocks there are, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:
32 total blocks - 12 blocks (blue and yellow) = 20 red blocks

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

"Okay, let's break this down. Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour, so he covers 5 * 18 = 90 miles. Then he turns around and drives east for 8 hours at the same speed, covering 8 * 18 = 144 miles. Since he drove 90 miles west and then 144 miles back east, he ends up 144 - 90 = 54 miles east of his starting point.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat starts at $9000.
   - It depreciates by 30%.
   - 30% of $9000 is \( 0.30 \times 9000 = 2700 \).
   - So, after the first year, the boat is worth \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat is now worth $6300.
   - It depreciates by another 30%.
   - 30% of $6300 is \( 0.30 \times 6300 = 1890 \).
   - So, after the second year, the boat is worth \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat is now worth $4410.
   - It depreciates by 20%.
   - 20% of $4410 is \( 0.20 \times 4410 = 882 \).
   - So, after the third year, the boat is worth \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \).

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

"To find out how many pink candies there are, let's first figure out how many of each color we have:

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \)
- Yellow candies: Half the amount of red candies, so \( 54 \div 2 = 27 \)

Now, let's add up the candies we know about:
\[ 54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189 \]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. So, the number of pink candies is:
\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the costs separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel:
- Helen stayed for 3 nights.
- The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
- So, the total cost for the hotel is 3 nights * $80/night = $240.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus rides:
- Helen rode the bus 7 times.
- Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
- 10% of $80 is $80 * 0.10 = $8.
- So, the total cost for the bus rides is 7 trips * $8/trip = $56.

Now, let's add the costs together:
- Total cost for the hotel: $240
- Total cost for the bus rides: $56
- Total cost for the trip: $240 + $56 = $296

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find the total weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so that's 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:
1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. So, we calculate 1% of 1600 pounds:
1% of 1600 = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds.

"To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to find out the total length of the fence where he wants to hang the streamers. Since the fence is a rectangle, we can add up all the sides to get the total length.

The long sides are each 20 feet, and there are two of them, so that's 20 feet times 2, which equals 40 feet. The short sides are each 15 feet, and there are two of them, so that's 15 feet times 2, which equals 30 feet.

Now, we add the lengths of the long sides and the short sides together: 40 feet plus 30 feet, which equals 70 feet.

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To figure out how much Avery will spend, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plate and bowl, and then add them all up.

1. Dinner plates: $6.00 each
2. Salad plates: $4.00 each
3. Bowls: $5.00 each

She needs 12 of each for 12 people.

- Cost of dinner plates: 12 * $6.00 = $72.00
- Cost of salad plates: 12 * $4.00 = $48.00
- Cost of bowls: 12 * $5.00 = $60.00

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much feed one pig eats in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day, so:
4 pounds x 2 = 8 pounds per pig per day.

Now, Dexter has five pigs, so the total amount of feed they eat in a day is:
8 pounds x 5 pigs = 40 pounds per day.

Next, we need to find out how much feed they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
40 pounds x 7 days = 280 pounds per week.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left after a week, we subtract the amount they eat in a week from the total amount ordered:
300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds left.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. John invited 20 people, and each person will eat 2 hot dogs.
   - So, 20 people * 2 hot dogs/person = 40 hot dogs needed.

2. John already has 4 hot dogs left over.
   - So, he needs 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs.

3. Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs.
   - So, 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs of hot dogs.

4. Each pack costs $2.
   - So, 6 packs * $2/pack = $12.

John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"First, let's figure out how much money Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

So, the total money she makes from selling cupcakes and cookies is:
$40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80

Next, let's figure out how much she spends on the trays.

She buys 5 trays at $4 each:
5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Now, to find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract the amount she spent from the amount she made:
$80 (total made) - $20 (total spent) = $60

So, Frances has $60 left.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. At the end of the first street, there are 5 children following the truck.
2. On the second street, each of these 5 children is joined by another child. So, 5 children each bring 1 more child, which adds 5 more children to the group. Now, the total number of children is 5 (original) + 5 (new) = 10 children.
3. On the third street, each of these 10 children is joined by 2 more children. So, 10 children each bring 2 more children, which adds 20 more children to the group. Now, the total number of children is 10 (existing) + 20 (new) = 30 children.
4. The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we subtract the 5 original children from the total. Now, the total number of children is 30 - 5 = 25 children.

So, the final number of children following the truck is 25.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, we calculate the time Charisma spends on meditation each day:
- She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening.
- So, she meditates for 15 + 15 = 30 minutes each day.

Next, we calculate the total time she spends on meditation in one week:
- She meditates for 30 minutes each day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, she meditates for 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Now, we calculate the total time she spends on meditation in 4 weeks:
- She meditates for 210 minutes each week.
- So, in 4 weeks, she meditates for 210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time she spends on yoga each week:
- She practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week.
- So, she practices yoga for 1 hour/day * 5 days/week = 5 hours/week.

Now, we convert the yoga time to minutes:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes.
- So, 5 hours/week = 5 * 60 = 300 minutes/week.

Next, we calculate the total time she spends on yoga in 4 weeks:
- She practices yoga for 300 minutes each week.
- So, in 4 weeks, she practices yoga for 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

Finally, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks:
- Total time = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

So, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate:
50% of 36 = 0.5 x 36 = 18 seeds

So, a large sunflower has:
36 + 18 = 54 seeds

Now, to find the total number of seeds from both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds together:

So, Ryan spends $5 on ice cream.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream from the total amount of money Ryan has:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

So, Ryan has $13 left.

Finally, we need to figure out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we divide:

"Okay, let's break this down. Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she can run twice as far as Aaron. This means Aaron ran 2 miles. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it means Vanessa takes twice as long to run each mile compared to Aaron.

Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so he took 8 minutes per mile. Since Vanessa takes twice as long per mile, she takes 16 minutes per mile. 

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so she took 4 miles × 16 minutes per mile = 64 minutes.

"To figure out how much line the caretaker needs, first, we need to calculate how much line is required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3:

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line/foot of dock = 600 feet of line

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total needed:

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"Okay, let's break this down. Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. Each person orders 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's $10 per person. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. So, for each reservation, the total cost is $10 (for the meals) + $5 (for the wine) = $15.

Since there are 6 reservations a night, the total for one night is 6 reservations * $15 per reservation = $90.

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total for the week is 2 days * $90 per day = $180.

"First, we need to find out how much the fruit vendor made in total after selling all the watermelons at a 25% profit.

The cost price of the watermelons is $80. A 25% profit on $80 is calculated as:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * 80 = $20

So, the total selling price is:
$80 (cost price) + $20 (profit) = $100

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
$100 / 50 watermelons = $2 per watermelon

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
2. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
3. John had James when he was 19, so John is now 18 + 19 = 37 years old.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour.

- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange. So, in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange. So, in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.

The difference is:
\[
20 - 15 = 5
\]

So, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the cost of the new radiator is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. So, he only pays 20% of the original price:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, the mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:
230"
"Okay, let's think about this. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. If all 20 animals were chickens, they would have 40 legs in total. But we know they have 70 legs, which is 30 more legs than if they were all chickens. Since each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken, we can figure out how many cows there are by dividing the extra legs by 2. So, 30 extra legs divided by 2 legs per cow means there are 15 cows. If there are 15 cows, then the rest of the animals must be chickens. So, 20 animals minus 15 cows leaves 5 chickens.

"Okay, let's figure this out. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, first we need to find out how many slices there are in total. 

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. We need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person gets.

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each of them can have 14 slices.
