"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. That means she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for herself. 

The number of eggs left to sell is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. 

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is 9 * 2 = $18.

"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Determine the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs.
3. Subtract the total cost from the new value to find the profit.

First, the increase in the value of the house is 150% of the original value. The original value of the house is $80,000.

150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

So, the new value of the house is:
$80,000 (original value) + $120,000 (increase) = $200,000

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs:
$80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
$200,000 (new value) - $130,000 (total cost) = $70,000

So, the profit Josh made is:
$70,000"
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

He runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So for each session, he runs:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens each day.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement.

First, we know that each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we add the feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement to find out how much feed is needed for the final meal:
\[ 60 \text{ cups (total daily requirement)} - 40 \text{ cups (morning and afternoon)} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount.

1. First, let's determine the cost of the glasses that are not discounted:
   - There are 16 glasses in total.
   - Every second glass is discounted, so there are 8 glasses that are not discounted.
   - The cost of each non-discounted glass is $5.
   - Total cost for non-discounted glasses: \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) dollars.

2. Next, let's determine the cost of the discounted glasses:
   - There are 8 discounted glasses.
   - Each discounted glass costs 60% of $5, which is \( 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for discounted glasses: \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

3. Finally, add the total costs of the non-discounted and discounted glasses:
   - Total cost: \( 40 + 24 = 64 \) dollars.

So, Kylar needs to pay 64 dollars for 16 glasses.

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We know Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, let's add up the total number of sheep:

- Seattle: 20 sheep
- Charleston: 80 sheep
- Toulouse: 160 sheep

Total number of sheep = \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Add the time for the Windows update:**
   - The update takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time to download the file from the beginning again:**
   - The entire file is 200 GB.
   - Time to download 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \) minutes.

4. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Time to download 40% of the file: 40 minutes.
   - Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes.
   - Time to download the entire file again: 100 minutes.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered = 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially drove 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month**: The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month**: The number of downloads was three times the first month. So, the downloads in the second month are:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]
3. **Third Month**: The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. First, calculate 30% of 180:
   \[
   0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Then, subtract this from the second month's downloads to get the third month's downloads:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

1. **Donuts:**
   - She bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add the costs of all the pastries together:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

So, the total cost is $694.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit he makes each year and see when this profit covers the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Income**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. So, the annual income from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the annual income minus the annual expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]
5. **Break-even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net annual profit:
   \[
   \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After selling at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
6. After selling at the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which is given as 5.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both jobs and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year
Earnings from teaching = 35 * 20 * 50
Earnings from teaching = 700 * 50
Earnings from teaching = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from being a cheerleading coach:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year
Earnings from coaching = 15 * 30 * 50
Earnings from coaching = 450 * 50
Earnings from coaching = $22,500

Now, we add the earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
Total annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500
Total annual salary = $57,500

"To find out the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Taken} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"First, let's figure out how much water is in the orange drink and the pineapple drink before any spilling occurs.

For the orange drink:
- The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
- So, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
- So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to calculate how much water is in the spilled orange drink:
- The spilled orange drink is 1 liter, and two-thirds of it is water.
- So, the amount of water in the spilled orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \) liters.

The remaining orange drink is:
- 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters.

The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:
- \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) liters.

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Water from the remaining orange drink: 6 liters.
- Water from the pineapple drink: 9 liters.
- Total water: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is 15 liters.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid, $19.50, is 75% of the original price because he received a 25% discount. 

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

The equation to represent this situation is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours per day John spends on the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.

First, we know each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of, and John has 10 dogs. So, the total hours per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final answer is:

"Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \). Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of the silver and gold coins, which is 110. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of silver coins is 40. The number of gold coins is:
\[ S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, and Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total:

Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each half of his ping pong session and then add them together.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more than 4 points:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
- So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we add the points from both halves:
- Total points = 4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

1. **Total Distance**: John runs 60 miles a week.

2. **Total Time**:
   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.
   - Total time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Average Speed**:
   - Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
   - Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distances she covers while running and walking over the six hours.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance covered while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles per hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance covered while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles per hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"First, let's figure out how many calories are in the entire 300g bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily target. You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat to stay within the 200 calories. Since the entire bag (300g) has 1250 calories, we can set up a proportion to find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{300 \text{ grams} \times 200 \text{ calories}}{1250 \text{ calories}} \]

\[ x = \frac{60000}{1250} \]

\[ x = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes she had initially plus the number in the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining from the total to find the number in the package.

First, we know Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220 Post-it notes.

Next, we know she had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using 220. This means the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them was:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

"First, let's figure out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches, the total number of students, and then multiply by the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\) classes.

Next, we calculate the total number of students:
- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\) students.

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money Judy makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total amount is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in one week.

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total from selling brownies and the total from selling cheesecakes, and then add these amounts together.

First, we calculate the total from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownie slices.
- So, the total from brownies is \( 43 \times 3 = 129 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 cheesecake slices.
- So, the total from cheesecakes is \( 23 \times 4 = 92 \) dollars.

Now, we add the two totals together to find the total amount of money raised:
- Total money raised = \( 129 + 92 = 221 \) dollars.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for all the cell phones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by the number of months (3) to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Total cost of the cell phones without interest
- Cost per phone = $150
- Number of phones = 5
- Total cost = $150 * 5 = $750

Step 2: Total interest for all the cell phones
- Interest rate = 2%
- Total interest = 2% of $750 = 0.02 * $750 = $15

Step 3: Total amount to be paid
- Total amount = Total cost + Total interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 4: Monthly payment
- Number of months = 3
- Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months = $765 / 3 = $255

Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar.
2. Calculate the total revenue for each type of flower by multiplying the rounded price by the number of pots sold.
3. Add up the total revenue from all the flowers to find out how much Artie will make.

Let's start with rounding the prices:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Next, we calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00

Finally, we add up the total revenue:

$36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

So, Artie will make $88.00.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

1. The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.
2. The 3rd level will have twice the square footage of the 4th level: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \).
3. The 2nd level will have twice the square footage of the 3rd level: \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \).
4. The 1st level will have twice the square footage of the 2nd level: \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \).

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

The average square footage of a level is 60.

"First, let's figure out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

To find David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- The cost for packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost for packages of 2 is $9.00.

The amount saved by buying the flowers in packages of 2 is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

"First, let's figure out how much water the two girls got together. Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water.

1/6 of 24 liters is:
\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got is:
\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:
\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water initially was 24 liters. So, the amount of water left is:

"Let's set up the problem with a bit of algebra. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find out how many quilt blocks Gene has in total, we need to calculate the number of vacations he has been on and then multiply that by the number of shirts (or blocks) he gets from each year.

1. First, determine the number of years Gene has been going on vacations:
   - He started at age 23 and is now 34.
   - Number of years = 34 - 23 = 11 years.

2. Next, calculate the total number of vacations he has been on:
   - He goes on 4 vacations each year.
   - Total vacations = 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

3. Since each vacation results in one quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is the same as the total number of vacations.

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is 44.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive over these years.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7200

Since Sylvie has just completed 5 years, she will receive a 10% increase on her initial salary.

3. **First Increase (after 5 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $600 + (10% of $600) = $600 + $60 = $660
   - New Annual Salary: $660 * 12 = $7920

After the first year of the increase (6 years of service), she will receive another 10% increase.

4. **Second Increase (after 6 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726
   - New Annual Salary: $726 * 12 = $8712

After the second year of the increase (7 years of service), she will receive another 10% increase.

5. **Third Increase (after 7 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
   - New Annual Salary: $798.60 * 12 = $9583.20

"To find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we know that each adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad. There are 20 adult dinosaurs, so:
\[ 10 \text{ lbs/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, each child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, which is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]
There are 5 child dinosaurs, so:
\[ 5 \text{ lbs/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the amounts together:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time and then calculate his improved time after the 10% increase in speed.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means he can run 10% faster, which translates to a 10% reduction in time.
   - To find the new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds.
   - 10% of 40 seconds is \( 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Gerald's improved time is \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) seconds.

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit, so they did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total time he spent watching TV each day and then solve for Wednesday.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: He watched 1-hour episodes each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours

2. **Wednesday**: He watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday \(x\).
   - Total for Wednesday: \(0.5x\) hours (since each episode is 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours)

3. **Thursday**: He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours

4. **Friday**: He watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours

Now, let's add up all the time he spent watching TV:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7 \text{ hours}\]

Combine the known values:
\[2 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7\]

Simplify the equation:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total area of the fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- Her roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Beatrice's roll-up is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- His roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Marcell's roll-up is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups.

Next, we add the total areas to find the combined total:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\) roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the combined total by the number of people (2):
- Average = \(90 \div 2 = 45\).

"First, let's figure out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

To find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{x \text{ feet}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{64 \text{ seconds} \times 20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ x = \frac{1280 \text{ feet-seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ x = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that for every 10 feet she rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 80 \text{ feet} \]
\[ = \frac{160 \text{ liters-feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \]
\[ = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of lessons in a day. Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons, we multiply the number of teachers by the number of lessons each teacher has:
   \[
   4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons/day}
   \]

2. Each lesson involves cleaning the whiteboard 3 times. So, to find the total number of cleanings in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
   \[
   8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day}
   \]

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Total cost for all the lumber = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, considering the 50% price increase.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original price = $10.
- New price = $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original price = $16.
- New price = $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.

Total selling price for all the lumber = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, let's find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 7 + 13 = 20 \]

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We need to determine how many parts each unit (teaspoon of sugar or cup of water) represents:
\[ \text{Each part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying the number of parts of sugar by the value of each part:
\[ \text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Count**: On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
   - Total vehicles on the first day = 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

2. **Total Vehicles After the Second Day**: The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30.

3. **Vehicles Added on the Second Day**: To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles.
   - Vehicles added on the second day = 30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (first day) = 20 vehicles.

4. **Number of Containers on the Second Day**: Each container contains 5 vehicles. To find the number of containers, we divide the number of vehicles added on the second day by the number of vehicles per container.
   - Number of containers on the second day = 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago.
3. Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years.
4. Lylah's salary also increased, but the percentage increase is not specified, only that it increased simultaneously with Adrien's.

### Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago
If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later
Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years:
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later
Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we can use the same 40% increase:
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later
\[ \text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's new salary} \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"First, let's figure out how many hours Jordan would work in a week if he spent his video game time working instead.

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Now, if Jordan works these 14 hours at his part-time job, where he earns $10 an hour, we can calculate his earnings as follows:
14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"First, let's identify the food and nonfood items:
- Food items: milk (2 dollars), eggs (3 dollars)
- Nonfood items: light bulbs (3 dollars), cups (3 dollars), roach traps (4 dollars)

Next, calculate the total cost of the food items:
2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Now, calculate the total cost of the nonfood items before tax:
3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Calculate the tax on the nonfood items (10% of 10 dollars):
10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar

Add the tax to the cost of the nonfood items:
10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Finally, add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items with tax:
5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John has in his field at one time.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest in a year.
3. Multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples in the field
- John has 10 hectares.
- Each hectare has 100 pineapples.
- Total pineapples = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Number of harvests = 12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests.

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples per harvest = 1000 pineapples.
- Number of harvests in a year = 4.
- Total pineapples harvested in a year = 1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees half as many bees return as she saw leave in the first 6 hours.
   - Half of 30 is 15.
   - So, 15 bees return to the hive.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Two times 30 is 60.
   - So, 60 bees leave the hive.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left before the last 6 hours: 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (third 6 hours) = 90 bees.
   - Bees that had already returned: 15 bees.
   - Bees that need to return: 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

So, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the cost of one adult ticket and one child ticket, and then add the change she received back to this total.

The cost of one adult ticket is $12.
The cost of one child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for one adult and one child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference in their travel times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute:
- 1 mile = 5280 feet

Steve's distance:
- 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet

Tim's distance:
- 2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time:
- Speed = 440 feet per minute
- Time = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time:
- Speed = 264 feet per minute
- Time = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

Now, we find the difference in their travel times:
- Difference = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating the tires of bicycles, tricycles, and a unicycle.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by to get the tire inflated, that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Now, we add up all the tires:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, the total cost is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. **Dave ate 14 fries.**
2. **The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:**
   \[
   \text{Seagull ate} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]
3. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:**
   \[
   \text{Pigeons ate} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]
4. **Total fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons:**
   \[
   14 + 7 + 9 = 30 \text{ fries}
   \]
5. **Let \( x \) be the total number of fries initially. After the seagull and pigeons, the remaining fries are:**
   \[
   x - 30
   \]
6. **A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:**
   \[
   \text{Raccoon ate} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
7. **The remaining fries after the raccoon:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
8. **Ants carried off one more fry, leaving 5 fries:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
   \]
   \[
   x - 30 = 18

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- So, each of these days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- So, each of these days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from all the days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
- Total weekly hours = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, to find the total number of hours Kimo spends in class over the 16-week semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
- Total semester hours = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, which in this case will be feet. 

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 inches is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - 6 inches is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Add the lengths together:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference between the two distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Running back and forth once covers 200 yards (100 yards each way).
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.

\[ \text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth from the 40-yard line, which means she runs 40 yards to the end of the field and 40 yards back.
- This covers 80 yards each time (40 yards each way).
- Kelly does this 34 times.

\[ \text{Distance Kelly runs} = 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we find the difference between the distances run by Blake and Kelly:

\[ \text{Difference} = 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser.

"To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to add up the number of each type of fish they caught.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish Locsin caught:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish each of them caught:
- Anakin's total: 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.
- Locsin's total: 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish.

Finally, we add Anakin's and Locsin's totals together to get the overall total:
19 fish (Anakin) + 13 fish (Locsin) = 32 fish.

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months with a 20% increase every two months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step.

1. First, determine the number of 2-month periods in 36 months:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

2. Each period, the price increases by 20% of the original price. This means the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20%) each period.

3. The formula to calculate the final price after 18 periods is:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

4. Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}

"Let's set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we let Brooke's current age be \( B \), then Seth's current age is \( 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old, and Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old. The sum of their ages in 2 years is \( (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[
(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first figure out how many gallons of lemonade they sold.

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.
   - Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( G \).

2. Calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost = \( 5G \).

3. Calculate the total revenue:
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Total revenue = \( 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \).

4. Use the profit formula:
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - $25 = 10G - 5G
   - $25 = 5G
   - \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. Calculate the cost of lemons:
   - Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
   - Total cost of lemons = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

So, they spent $15 on lemons.

"To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race. 

The total number of Asians in the race is 240, and out of these, 80 are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese participants is:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to family} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the final remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have 350 dollars.

"First, let's figure out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so:
Monic = Bo - 4
Monic = 40 - 4
Monic = 36 crabs

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so:
Rani = Monic + 10
Rani = 36 + 10
Rani = 46 crabs

Now, let's add up the crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together:
Total crabs = Bo + Monic + Rani
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week:
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- So, his earnings for the first week are 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- So, his earnings for the second week are 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 + $80 = $130.

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of white carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, \( 200 = 5C \).

2. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - \( C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \).

3. **Determine the number of red roses:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Let \( R \) be the number of red roses.
   - Therefore, \( R = 4C \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's age is given as 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Mark's age two years ago was 5 years older than 14, so:
     \[
     M - 2 = 14 + 5
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 19
     \]
   - Solve for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 19 + 2
     \]
     \[
     M = 21
     \]

4. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so:
     \[
     \text{Jean's age} = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
     \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

### Team 1 (Well-Rounded Team)
Each member of this team runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for Team 1 is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The times for each member of Team 2 are as follows:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for Team 2 is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Times
The difference in the total times between the two teams is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the faster team (Team 1) will win by:
\[ 2 \text{ seconds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first event is 2 times more likely than the second event.
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     2 \times 100 = 200\%
     \]

So, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

3. **Straw for rabbits:** 20 pieces
4. **Straw for rats:** 160 (total) - 50 (hamsters) - 20 (rabbits) = 90 pieces

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's find out the total number of rats:

- **Total number of rats:** 90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups:

- **Number of rats per cage:** 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage

"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, but since the interest is applied monthly and the period is short, we can calculate it step by step.

1. **Initial amount (Principal)**: $100
2. **Monthly interest rate**: 2% or 0.02

For each month, the amount owed increases by 2% of the previous month's amount.

**Month 1:**
\[ \text{Amount after 1 month} = 100 + (100 \times 0.02) = 100 + 2 = 102 \]

**Month 2:**
\[ \text{Amount after 2 months} = 102 + (102 \times 0.02) = 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

**Month 3:**
\[ \text{Amount after 3 months} = 104.04 + (104.04 \times 0.02) = 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, let's break down the costs and profits step by step.

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: The trader buys each bag for $20.
2. **Transport cost per bag**: It costs $2 to transport each bag.
3. **Total cost per bag**: The total cost for each bag is $20 (buying) + $2 (transport) = $22.
4. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. **Profit per bag**: The profit for each bag is $30 (selling price) - $22 (total cost) = $8.
6. **Total profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400.

To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides.

1. **Cost of tickets**: $20.25
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
- Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
- Amount each friend paid = Total cost / 3
- Amount each friend paid = $102 / 3 = $34

So, each of them paid $34.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net change in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total earnings from both publishers.

1. First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
   \]
   For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores:
- The formula for the average is: (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)
- We want the average to be 93 over 5 tests: 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we need to find the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 92, 100, 86
- Sum of these scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

To find the score needed on the sixth test, we set up the equation:
- Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
- The total sum of the five highest scores should be 465: 367 + x = 465

Solving for \( x \):
- \( x = 465 - 367 \)
- \( x = 98 \)

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

   - He rides 5 times a week.
   - Each ride is 25 kilometers.
   - Total kilometers per week = 5 rides/week * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week.
   - Total kilometers for 4 weeks = 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

2. **Next Three Weeks:**
   - He rides 2 times a week.
   - Each ride is 60 kilometers.
   - Total kilometers per week = 2 rides/week * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week.
   - Total kilometers for 3 weeks = 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

3. **Total Kilometers:**
   - Total kilometers for the first four weeks + Total kilometers for the next three weeks = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40 grams/chocolate bar = 1000 grams

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20 grams/candied apple = 1600 grams

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then add them all together.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought:
3 * 4 = 12 cakes

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought:
5 * 12 = 60 cakes

Now, we add the number of cakes bought each day to find the total:
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Total cost of 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Calculate the cost of one cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups means 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Total cost of 240 cups = $34800.
   - Cost of one cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, let's first calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
2 pairs * $20/pair = $40

So, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs:
$70 - $10 = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so she earns:
4 times * $5/time = $20

Now, let's add the $20 she earns from babysitting to her savings:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (from babysitting) = $30

Sara still needs:
$70 (total cost) - $30 (savings and babysitting earnings) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns per lawn:
$40 / $4/lawn = 10

Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times.

"Let's set up the problem with some equations. Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens and \( w \) be the number of white chickens. According to the problem:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
2. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
3. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]
\[ w = r + 2 \]

Now, substitute \( w \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time \(T\) he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

Now, let's add the number of customers from the first two days:
100 (first day) + 150 (second day) = 250 customers.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers over the three days:
500 (total) - 250 (first two days) = 250 customers.

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S \) gallons. Therefore, the big pool had \( 2S \) gallons 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S - 16 \) gallons, and the current amount of water in the big pool is \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ 2S - 4S = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2S = -48 \]
\[ S = 24 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 24 gallons of water. Therefore, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \]

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00.

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. She earns $8.00 per hour.

Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth has to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate how much she will pay in total over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"First, let's figure out the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's age.

Harriet is 21 years old now. Since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \]

Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Now, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

Next, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we first need to determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the information given.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points of the other three students from 251:

"First, we need to find out how much water was left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. 

The tank originally had 120 liters. After using 90 liters, the amount of water left is:
120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank:
30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

"To find out how many flowers Andy plants in total, we first need to figure out how many petunias he plants. According to the problem, Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Since he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

"First, let's find out how many Pokemon cards James has in total after losing and buying some cards.

Initially, he has:
- 30 fire type
- 20 grass type
- 40 water type

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type

After buying 14 more grass type cards, he has:
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type

Now, the total number of cards is:
- 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, converting to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer:

"First, let's figure out how many pen pals Mike still has. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:

5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:

3 pen pals * 2 letters/pen pal * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing 30 pages, we multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page:

30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

1. First, calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss:
   - He calls his boss for 15 minutes every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - So, \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. Add the extra minutes he has used:
   - He has used 300 extra minutes.
   - So, \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

3. Subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan:
   - His plan is 1000 minutes.
   - So, \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

Jason has 250 minutes left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin.
   - Griffin now has \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle.
   - Billy takes \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   - Griffin now has \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries.
4. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, let's call this number \( x \).
   - Griffin now has \( 9 + x \) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   - Colby takes \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   - Griffin now has \( 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x \) fries.
6. In the end, Griffin has 27 fries.
   - So, \( 7 + x = 27 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 7 + x = 27 \]
\[ x = 27 - 7 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of snails in each aquarium:**
   - Aquarium 1: 4 snails
   - Aquarium 2: 32 snails

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:**
   - Difference = 32 snails - 4 snails = 28 snails

3. **Set up the relationship between the difference in snails and the number of fish:**
   - The difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

4. **Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).**

5. **Set up the equation based on the given relationship:**
   - 28 = 2 * (2f)
   - 28 = 4f

6. **Solve for \( f \):**
   - \( f = \frac{28}{4} \)
   - \( f = 7 \)

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"First, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
3. The makeup is needed 4 times a week.
4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} \]

\[ 250 \times 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 30,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 30,000 = 0.10 \times 30,000 = 3,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

From the first statement, ""Ruby is 6 times older than Sam,"" we can write:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second statement, ""In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam,"" we can write:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expand and simplify:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter bought 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- The total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter bought 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- The total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = 5 + 2 = 7 dollars

So, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba:**
   - A cobra has 70 spots.
   - A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
   - Therefore, a mamba has \( \frac{70}{2} = 35 \) spots.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras:**
   - There are 40 cobras.
   - Each cobra has 70 spots.
   - Total spots for cobras = \( 40 \times 70 = 2800 \) spots.

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas:**
   - There are 60 mambas.
   - Each mamba has 35 spots.
   - Total spots for mambas = \( 60 \times 35 = 2100 \) spots.

4. **Calculate the combined total number of spots:**
   - Total spots for cobras = 2800
   - Total spots for mambas = 2100
   - Combined total spots = \( 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \) spots.

5. **Find half the number of spots they all have combined:**
   - Half of 4900 = \( \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \).

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length taken by the topaz gemstones and then determine how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. First, calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 * 1 inch = 8 inches.

2. Next, determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length taken by topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

3. Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = 17 inches / 0.25 inches per bead = 68 beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"First, let's figure out how much money Kelly has in total.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so:
5 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 125 cents

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so:
2 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 20 cents

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows. 

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Since each of these rows has 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles.

First, let's find the speed of the car in the slow lane:
- The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
- The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed.

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the slow lane car is 30 miles/hour.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles is:

"First, let's figure out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate Izzy's medals as follows:

Izzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5
Izzy's medals = 22 - 5
Izzy's medals = 17

Next, we need to find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

Total medals (Ali + Izzy) = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals
Total medals (Ali + Izzy) = 22 + 17
Total medals (Ali + Izzy) = 39

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total medals Ali and Izzy have:

Total medals given out = 10 × Total medals (Ali + Izzy)
Total medals given out = 10 × 39
Total medals given out = 390

"First, let's find out the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 bars/packet = 40 bars

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

Total chocolate bars for adults = 4 adults * 6 bars/adult = 24 bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children.

Chocolate bars left for children = Total chocolate bars - Total chocolate bars for adults
Chocolate bars left for children = 40 bars - 24 bars = 16 bars

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them.

Chocolate bars per child = Chocolate bars left for children / Number of children
Chocolate bars per child = 16 bars / 8 children = 2 bars/child

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he does not get an extra point: \(18\) points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
2. There are 5 members eating rice, and they eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner).
3. So, the total rice consumption per day is:
   \[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

4. Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
   \[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

5. Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

"To find out how much John pays a year for the driving service, we need to calculate the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus given to the driver over the year.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back each day, which is 60 miles per day.
- He works 5 days a week, so he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
- Over 50 weeks, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- The cost is $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, the cost is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- John gives a $150 bonus per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total annual cost:
- Total cost = Cost of miles + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's set up the problem with variables to make it easier to solve. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

3 families * 4 people/family = 12 people

Adding these together gives the total number of people invited:
12 people + 12 people = 24 people

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments.

1/4 of 8 people is:
1/4 * 8 = 2 people

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
8 people + 2 people = 10 people

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
24 people - 10 people = 14 people

"First, let's find out how many marbles Solomon has in total.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He already had 50 marbles in his store.
3. His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

Now, let's add all the marbles together:
\[ 20 \text{ (from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg/marble} = 156 \text{ kg} \]

"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool can be found using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem also states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. So, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. So, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

"First, let's figure out how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. Jam has a total of 26 pencils, and 2 of those are loose. So, the pencils in the boxes are:

26 pencils - 2 loose pencils = 24 pencils in the boxes

Since these 24 pencils are evenly distributed among 3 boxes, each box contains:

24 pencils ÷ 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, let's find out how many boxes Meg needs for her 46 pencils. If each box holds 8 pencils, then:

46 pencils ÷ 8 pencils per box = 5.75 boxes

Since Meg can't have a fraction of a box, she will need 6 boxes to store all her pencils.

Now, we add the number of boxes Jam and Meg need together:

Jam's 3 boxes + Meg's 6 boxes = 9 boxes

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool her coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total amount by which the coffee is weakened.

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:
     \[
     \frac{65}{13} = 5
     \]
   - So, Shannon uses 5 ice cubes.

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is:
     \[
     5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Add the weakening effect of the cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   - The total weakening effect is:
     \[
     60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers:**
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Monthly salary of each junior programmer = $2000.
   - Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 \times $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total amount paid to senior programmers:**
   - Number of senior programmers = 60.
   - Monthly salary of each senior programmer = $2400.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplify the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To solve this, we need to figure out how much more charge the phone needs to be fully charged and then calculate the time based on the rate of charging.

1. The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged.
2. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes.
3. To find out how long it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3 minutes (since it takes 3 minutes to charge 1 percentage-point).

\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

4. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

"First, let's figure out how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. 

$80 / $20 = 4 rewards

This means they had $4 off to use on their next shopping trip.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 in rewards, and the coupon they had took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

Twice the amount of the rewards is:
2 * $4 = $8

So, the total discount they got is:
$4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12

Now, subtract the total discount from the amount they spent:
$43 - $12 = $31

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

15 hours = 30% of total time
15 hours = 0.30 * total time

To find the total time, we divide both sides by 0.30:
Total time = 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
40% of 50 hours = 0.40 * 50 hours = 20 hours

"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]

Now, let's add up all the money she has. She already has $80 in savings, plus the $200 from her first job, and the $75 from her second job:

\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:

\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.
2. The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is \(6 + 5 = 11\) feet.
3. The combined height of the shortest and second tree is \(6 + 11 = 17\) feet.
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second tree, so it is \(2 \times 17 = 34\) feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
6 * 2 = $12

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
5 * 1 = $5

The total cost of the toys is:
12 + 5 = $17

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
28 - 17 = $11

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
11 + 10 = $21

"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for one person to do all the activities she wants.

1. Mini-golf: $5 per round
2. Arcade tokens: $5
3. Go-karts: $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so that's $20

Adding these up, the total cost for one person is:
\[ 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, Morgan has a total budget of $90. This budget needs to cover her own costs and the costs for her friends. First, we subtract the cost for Morgan herself:
\[ 90 - 30 = 60 \]

The remaining $60 is what she has left to spend on her friends. Since each friend also costs $30, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
\[ 60 \div 30 = 2 \]

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"First, let's figure out how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops, so:

25 cents * 4 = 100 cents

100 cents is equal to $1. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. After spending $1 on lollipops, she saves:

$5 - $1 = $4

She saves $4 each day. Over 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

$4 * 5 = $20

So, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is $20.

"First, let's figure out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying gumballs was:

$2 * 2 = $4

Now, we know Billy started with $10 and had $4 left as change after buying candy. So, the amount he spent on candy is:

$10 - $4 = $6

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:

$6 / $1.5/pound = 4 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip and then determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. **Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes 3 trips a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

4. **Determine how many days the train can operate before reaching 18,000 miles:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can operate, we divide 18,000 miles by the daily distance traveled: 
   \[
   \frac{18,000}{900} = 20

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold 3/5 of his land, then he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land equals 12.8 hectares.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares. According to the problem, we have:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}

- Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

The performance is only with the female members, so initially, there are 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of the 26 girls can't make it:

- Girls who can't make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13
- Girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours (since 90 minutes is 1.5 hours)

Next, we add up all the time spent:
- Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total time spent editing:
- Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
- Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100 = 20%

"To find out how many books Wendy needs, we first need to determine the number of books that can fit in the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double this number. First, we calculate double the number of books:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to this number:

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"First, let's figure out how many Valentine's cards Erica had initially. She made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each. So, the total number of cards from the boxes is 2 * 15 = 30 cards. Adding the cards she made, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards initially.

Next, we need to find out how many cards she passed out. She passed out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, which totals 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, we subtract the number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had initially: 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

Finally, we add the 17 cards she received from family and friends to the number of cards she has left: 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"First, let's figure out how many slices Bill and Mark get.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
12 slices * 1/3 = 4 slices

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
12 slices * 1/4 = 3 slices

Now, let's add up the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we add those to the total given away:
7 slices + 2 slices = 9 slices

Finally, we subtract the total slices given away from the original number of slices:
12 slices - 9 slices = 3 slices

"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Number of millipedes**: She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. 
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Number of stink bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, let's add up all the bugs:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Number of spiders} + \text{Number of millipedes} + \text{Number of stink bugs}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch:**
   - The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs:
     - Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
     - Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

2. **Calculate the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk needed:**
   - Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
     - Number of bags needed: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)
   - Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
     - Number of bottles needed: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

3. **Determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:**

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner.
2. Determine the reduction in daily energy usage when the air conditioner is used for fewer hours.
3. Calculate the total energy saved over 30 days.

First, let's calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner:
- The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
- Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
- Daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

Next, let's determine the reduction in daily energy usage:
- If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours.
- New daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
- Reduction in daily energy usage = 7200 watts/day - 2700 watts/day = 4500 watts/day.

Now, let's calculate the total energy saved over 30 days:
- Total energy saved = 4500 watts/day * 30 days = 135000 watts.
- Convert watts to kilowatts: 135000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts.

So, the total energy saved in 30 days is 135 kilowatts.

"To find out how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people.
2. Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed.
3. Compute the total cost for the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Determine the number of sandwiches needed.**
- Each sandwich serves 4 people.
- There are 20 people in total.
- Number of sandwiches needed = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed.**
- Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds.

**Step 3: Compute the total cost for the meat and cheese.**
- The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
- The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
- Total cost for meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
- Total cost for cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.
- Total cost for meat and cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, let's figure out how many corns Allan originally has. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, Allan has 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis. So, the number of corns now is:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Finally, to find the combined total of corns and cannolis, we add the number of corns and cannolis together:

\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has done 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps walking with his friend. So, before his jog, he had completed:

5,000 steps (to and from school) + 1,000 steps (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before his jog, he had:

10,000 steps (goal) - 2,000 steps (left) = 8,000 steps

Since he had 6,000 steps before his jog and 8,000 steps after his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is:

8,000 steps - 6,000 steps = 2,000 steps

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to calculate the payments for each month and then add them together.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month for simplicity)

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs half of $3, which is $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells:
\[ 1.50 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of candles that are expected to explode.
2. Determine the number of candles that are both expected to explode and have the wet dog smell defect.

First, we know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles are expected to explode.

1% of 50,000 candles:
\[ 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

So, 500 candles are expected to explode.

Next, we know that 5% of the more dangerous candles (those that are expected to explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

5% of 500 candles:
\[ 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

So, 25 candles are expected to both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

1. Calculate the discount amount per blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount is 30% of $20.
   - \( 30\% \) of \( 20 \) is \( 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \).

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( 20 - 6 = 14 \).

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost is the discounted price per blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
   - \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \).

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180.
2. The total number of humps (camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each) is 304.

We can write these as two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is:

"First, let's find the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which are $28. So, the jogger jeans cost:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to determine the original prices of the jeans before the savings. Let's denote the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \).

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the total savings, came from the tattered jeans:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

So, the original price of the tattered jeans \( T \) is:

\[ T = 28 + 4 = 32 \]

And the original price of the jogger jeans \( J \) is:

\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ J - T = 24 - 32 = -8 \]

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which implies a positive difference. Since the tattered jeans originally cost more, the correct interpretation is:

\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

So, the tattered jeans originally cost $8 more than the jogger jeans.

"To find out how much Aleksandra paid for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4:
   - 25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1
   - Cost of the soup = $4 + $1 = $5
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel:
   - Cost of the cake = $4 / 2 = $2

Now, we add the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of soup + Cost of bagel + Cost of cake
- Total cost = $5 + $4 + $2 = $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to work through the information step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 in total from selling his cards.
2. He sells each card for $1.5.
3. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount he made by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.
4. Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards he sold represent the 2/3 of his collection that he did not keep.
5. To find the total number of cards he started with, we can set up the equation: 2/3 * total cards = 100.
6. Solving for the total number of cards: total cards = 100 / (2/3) = 100 * (3/2) = 150.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - So, 18 guests would have 2 hotdogs each, and the other 18 guests would have 1 hotdog each.

2. **Total Hotdogs Prepared:**
   - For the 18 guests with 2 hotdogs each: \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - For the 18 guests with 1 hotdog each: \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs prepared: \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

3. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

4. **Shortage of Hotdogs:**
   - Hotdogs prepared: 54
   - Hotdogs needed: 80
   - Shortage: \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) hotdogs.

5. **Guests Without a Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is the same as the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means she pays 80% of the total cost:
$165.00 * 0.80 = $132.00.

So, the final cost of her order is:
$132.00."
"First, let's add up the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

"First, we need to figure out how many gallons of gas are in one container. Since 15 gallons are divided equally into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Josey needs 1/4 of a container, so we calculate 1/4 of 3 gallons:

3 gallons * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints:

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had $5 initially.
   - He had 1% of his money left, which means he had 1% of $5 left.
   - 1% of $5 is \( 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \) dollars, or 5 cents.
   - Therefore, the amount George spent is \( 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \) dollars, or 495 cents.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \) cents.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is 495 cents.
   - The amount spent on chips is 120 cents.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 495 - 120 = 375 \) cents.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents.
   - The number of candy bars George bought is \( \frac{375}{75} = 5 \).

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:
360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width):
Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.

Total beads Elizabeth bought:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} \]
\[ = 20 + 40 \]
\[ = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.

Total beads Margareth bought:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} + 4 \text{ packs of red} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} \]
\[ = 60 + 80 \]
\[ = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:

   - Jon's total time: 170 minutes
   - James' total time: \( 36 + 85 + x \)
   - Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:
   \[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
   \[ 121 + x = 180 \]

"First, let's figure out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1 hour = 60 minutes, so 30 minutes is half an hour.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we need to calculate how much hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles.

For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
For 16 miles, the horse will eat 16 × 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Now, let's find out the cost of 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3.
So, 8 bails of hay will cost 8 × $3 = $24.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has 6 × $5 = $30.

To find out how much change Michael will have after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has.

Change = $30 - $24 = $6

"Let's break down the costs to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, it costs $20 and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, making the total $21.

If you buy a regular movie ticket, it costs $12. You also buy one popcorn and a soda. The soda costs $3, so the total cost for the regular ticket, soda, and popcorn is $12 + $3 + (price of popcorn).

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket, soda, and popcorn should be $2 less than the super ticket cost of $21. This means the total cost for the regular ticket, soda, and popcorn is $19.

So, we have:
$12 (ticket) + $3 (soda) + (price of popcorn) = $19

Now, solve for the price of popcorn:
$15 + (price of popcorn) = $19
(price of popcorn) = $19 - $15

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume is found by multiplying the length, width, and height of the bed. 

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = 2 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10 to get the total volume of soil needed:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag to find out how many bags are needed:

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then the total weight of all the feed combined.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, we add up the total weight of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many trips the farmer needs to make with his truck, which can carry 2250 pounds at a time:
- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity

"First, let's find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 cards each:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, let's find out how many baseball cards she has. She has five boxes with 40 cards each:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, let's add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract these from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are given to her students, with each student receiving 10 cards. To find out how many students she has, we divide the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for the apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
20 apples * 45 cents/apple = 900 cents

Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, Becky paid:
900 cents / 100 = $9.00

Becky also received a $1 discount, so the total amount she paid is:
$9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for the apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 1000 cents

In dollars, this is:
1000 cents / 100 = $10.00

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is:
10% of $10.00 = 0.10 * $10.00 = $1.00

The total amount Kelly paid after the discount is:
$10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00

Now, we find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
$9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair = 2 shoes, 5 pairs = 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Monday: 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes. So, 15 pairs = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Wednesday: 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes. So, 30 pairs = 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Friday: 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Saturday: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, on Sunday, Frank will have 120 shoes.

"To figure out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's call the number of carrot sticks Matt eats ""c.""

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be written as:

\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we can set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the total length of the remoras.
3. Determine the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras' total length represents.

First, convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
- Each remora is 6 inches long.
- There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet.

Since there are 2 remoras, the total length of the remoras is:
- \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

Next, calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras' total length represents:
- The shark is 10 feet long.
- The remoras are 1 foot long in total.

The percentage is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day to break in his new shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason has to break in the shoes.
2. Divide the total minutes needed by the number of days he can walk.

First, we know that Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

However, Jason can only walk 4 days a week. So, we need to find out how many days he will actually walk in 3 weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to divide the total minutes required to break in the shoes by the number of days he will walk:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 12 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day to break in his new shoes.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

First, let's add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
- Kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Kids allergic to peanuts: 6

Adding these gives us:
9 + 6 = 15

However, this count includes the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both:
- Kids allergic to both: 3

So, the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is:
15 - 3 = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:
- Total number of kids in the class: 32

So, the number of kids not allergic to anything is:
32 - 12 = 20

"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food is $5 per person, so for \( x \) guests, the food cost is \( 5x \).
- The total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per person, so for \( x \) guests, the total cost is \( 25x \).

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests where the costs are the same:

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364 to find the total yards used:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we need to add up all the gifts she bought for her friends and the extra gifts she decided to get.

First, let's calculate the gifts for the 2 friends who each want 5 gifts:
2 friends * 5 gifts each = 10 gifts

Next, for the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
3 friends * 2 gifts each = 6 gifts

Now, add the 10 extra random gifts:
10 extra gifts

Adding all these together:
10 gifts (for the first 2 friends) + 6 gifts (for the other 3 friends) + 10 extra gifts = 26 gifts

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"First, let's find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet (width of the rug)

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

2 * 8 feet (width of the rug) = 16 feet
16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
2. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
3. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
4. She paid half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.
5. The total amount she paid was $7.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberry gum. We know the total cost and the cost of the grape and green apple gums:

Total cost = Cost of strawberry gum (2 packs) + Cost of grape gum + Cost of green apple gum
$7 = 2 * (Cost of one pack of strawberry gum) + $2 + $1

Let's solve for the cost of one pack of strawberry gum:

$7 = 2 * (Cost of one pack of strawberry gum) + $3
$7 - $3 = 2 * (Cost of one pack of strawberry gum)
$4 = 2 * (Cost of one pack of strawberry gum)
Cost of one pack of strawberry gum = $4 / 2
Cost of one pack of strawberry gum = $2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To find out the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to figure out how many sticks he can get from the cheapest option within his budget.

First, let's look at the cost and the number of sticks per piece of wood:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

Since Frederick is buying the cheapest lumber, he will only buy the 2 x 4 pieces of wood.

Next, we calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:
\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can make from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood:
\[ \text{Total sticks} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

So, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

1. Calculate the total number of bus trips Janet takes in a week:
   - She takes 2 bus trips each day.
   - She does this 5 days a week.
   - Total bus trips per week = 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

2. Calculate the total cost of these bus trips:
   - Each trip costs $2.20.
   - Total cost per week = 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week.

3. Determine the cost of the weekly bus pass:
   - The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.

4. Calculate the savings:
   - Savings = Total cost of bus trips without the pass - Cost of the weekly bus pass

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From point 3, if the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

From point 4, if the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, then the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Combined, the farm and the zoo have:

"To figure out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs. and then divide that by the number of days he has until his birthday.

1. **Total calories to burn to lose 30 lbs.**:
   - 1 pound = 3500 calories
   - 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

2. **Number of days from December 31st to July 19th**:
   - December 31st to January 1st: 1 day
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July 1st to July 19th: 19 days
   - Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

3. **Daily calorie deficit**:
   - Total calories to burn / Number of days = 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522.39 calories per day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 522 calories to reach his goal.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation. Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \) dollars. According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \) dollars.

The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. So, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ 3L = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tony's picking rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby's picking rate**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. So, Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's picking rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. So, Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's picking rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. So, Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

"Let's start by figuring out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 \]

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we can calculate the number of chairs Jenna has:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} \]

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 \]

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} \]

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} \]

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} \]

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the variations in his routine. 

1. Normally, he works out for 4 hours each week. Over 8 weeks, this would be:
   \( 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \)

2. However, there are exceptions:
   - For two consecutive weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week:
     \( 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \)
   - For one week, he worked out for 6 hours:
     \( 6 \text{ hours} \)

3. We need to adjust the total by subtracting the 4 hours he would have normally worked out during these weeks and adding the actual hours he worked out:
   - For the two weeks he worked out 5 hours each:
     \( 10 \text{ hours} - (4 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks}) = 10 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ extra hours} \)
   - For the one week he worked out 6 hours:
     \( 6 \text{ hours} - 4 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ extra hours} \)

4. Adding these extra hours to the normal total:
   \( 32 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ extra hours} + 2 \text{ extra hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \)

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. So, one-third of 21 is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700

Total cost of the 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of the computer - Cost of the printer
= $2,400 - $1,100 - $700
= $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
= $600 / 2
= $300

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This can be expressed as: 
     \[
     \text{Seashells brought by each girl} = 60 + 4 \times 60
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \text{Seashells brought by each girl} = 60 + 240 = 300
     \]

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together. Let's break it down:

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm.

Now, we add all these thicknesses together:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month, we first need to add up the number of vlogs she has already made over the first three weeks.

She made:
- 18 vlogs in the first week
- 21 vlogs in the second week
- 15 vlogs in the third week

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs in total for the month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"To figure out how much you end up paying, first, you need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the tip is $10. Now, add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you are splitting the check evenly but paying the entire tip, you pay half of the original bill plus the full tip:
\[ \frac{50}{2} + 10 = 25 + 10 = 35 \]

So, you end up paying $35.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the savings for each half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
   - He saves twice as much each day in the second half, so he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125

6. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25

"To solve this, let's break down what Elise does:

1. She writes the full alphabet twice. The alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice means:
   26 letters * 2 = 52 letters

2. She writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so:
   13 letters

3. She re-writes everything she has already written. So she writes the 52 letters from the first step and the 13 letters from the second step again:
   52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters

Now, we add up all the letters she has written:
52 letters (first full alphabet twice) + 13 letters (half alphabet) + 65 letters (rewriting everything) = 130 letters

"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the phone tree works. In each round, every family that was called in the previous round calls 3 new families. This means the number of families contacted grows exponentially.

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 new families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 new families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 new families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \(15 \times 7 = 105\) minutes.

Next, we need to convert the reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes: \(2 \div 1.5 = \frac{4}{3}\) pages per minute.
- Therefore, in 105 minutes, she reads \(105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140\) pages.

"To find out how much it will cost Michael to replace the carpet, we need to calculate the total cost based on the area of his bedroom and the costs associated with the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

First, calculate the area of the bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, calculate the cost for each component:
1. **New carpet cost**: 
\[ 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2,592 \]

2. **Padding cost**: 
\[ 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]

3. **Removal cost**: 
\[ 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

4. **Installation cost**: 
\[ 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7,344 \]

Now, add all these costs together to get the total cost:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The set temperature is 450 degrees, and the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

The percentage increase is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature.

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature.

Let \( x \) be the set temperature. The actual temperature will be:
\[ x + 0.04x = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.
3. Calculate how many months the tires will last.
4. Convert the number of months into years.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month.
- Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
- Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
- Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
  \[
  \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/725 rotations}} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
  \]

Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.
- Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

Step 3: Calculate how many months the tires will last.
- The number of months the tires will last is:
  \[
  \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations/month}} = 72 \text{ months}

1. The bottle gives 120 washings with 2 pumps per wash, so the total number of pumps in the bottle is:
   \[
   120 \text{ washings} \times 2 \text{ pumps/washing} = 240 \text{ pumps}
   \]

2. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents).

3. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:
   \[
   \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 10 \text{ cents/pump}
   \]

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so together they cost:
\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we need to apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42 on the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much butter is needed for 4 dozen croissants.
2. Calculate the total butter needed for a week.

First, since 1/4 pound of butter is needed for 1 dozen croissants, for 4 dozen croissants, we multiply 1/4 by 4:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 4 = 1 \text{ pound of butter} \]

Next, since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants every day for a week (7 days), we multiply the daily amount of butter by 7:
\[ 1 \times 7 = 7 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make croissants for a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Funding per month: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Funding per month for additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for the additional 45 months: 45 months * $30,000 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the additional 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the amounts of meat each player who ate meat consumed.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads Gary does in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of loads Gary does in a year.
3. Calculate the total amount of water used in a year.
4. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

Step 1: Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does 2 loads per week.

Step 2: There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Step 3: Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Step 4: The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"First, let's figure out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces of gum

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's an additional:

1 piece + 1 piece = 2 pieces

So, in total, Jim chews:

4 pieces + 2 pieces = 6 pieces

Starting with a 20 pack of gum, after chewing 6 pieces, he has:

20 pieces - 6 pieces = 14 pieces left

Jim then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So he gives away:

14 pieces / 2 = 7 pieces

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

14 pieces - 7 pieces = 7 pieces

"To solve this, we need to figure out how many inches Adam needs to grow to reach the required height and then how many years it will take him to grow that much.

1. First, convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 4 feet is:
   4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

2. Adam's current height is 40 inches. So, the number of inches he needs to grow is:
   48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

3. Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the total inches needed by the growth per year:
   8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost the company paid to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Step 1: Total sales amount
- James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
- Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

Step 2: Acquisition cost
- The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
- Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
- Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

Step 3: Profit
- Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
- Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Step 4: James's commission
- James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
- Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500.

1. Determine the total number of riders who can stay upright.
2. Calculate the number of women who can stay upright.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright:
\[ 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women:
\[ 60\% \times 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

   - Given: The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewel:**
   - The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   - Price of gold jewel = \( \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 \)
   - Price of gold jewel = \( \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} \)
   - Price of gold jewel = \( \frac{8000}{5} \)
   - Price of gold jewel = $1600

3. **Price of a Silver Jewel:**
   - The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. 

First, we calculate the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, the difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values we have:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To solve this, we need to figure out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

First, let's calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

This is within the limit of $10 per class. Now, let's see how many classes he can miss before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

If Manny misses 1 class, he attends 9 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{9} \approx 6.67 \]

If Manny misses 2 classes, he attends 8 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{8} = 7.50 \]

If Manny misses 3 classes, he attends 7 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \]

If Manny misses 4 classes, he attends 6 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

If Manny misses 5 classes, he attends 5 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

At this point, the cost per class exceeds $10. Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

So, the total cost of everything is $10800.

"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of articles published by the news website in February.
2. Calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company in February.
3. Add the two totals together to get the combined total.

First, the news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since February has 28 days:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, the sister company publishes 10 articles per day. For February:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, add the two totals together:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is:

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
Alisa's speed = 12 miles per hour
Alisa's time = 4.5 hours
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
Stanley's speed = 10 miles per hour
Stanley's time = 2.5 hours
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

79 miles"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through both the soil and the clay.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, so he digs 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time for both:
- Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages Mike plans to read each day:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is due in 30 days, we subtract the number of days it will take Mike to finish reading from the total number of days available:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to add the initial cost of the plane to the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel, and then multiply the monthly costs by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly cost to rent a hanger: $5,000
3. Monthly cost for fuel: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Total monthly maintenance cost = Cost of hanger + Cost of fuel
- Total monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Total annual maintenance cost = Total monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Total annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual maintenance cost:
- Total cost for the first year = Initial cost of the plane + Total annual maintenance cost
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
2. The total number of legs is 70.
3. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is 15.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so:

Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, let's add together the money of Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia:

Total money = Rayna's money + Kassidy's money + Aurelia's money
Total money = 150 + 90 + 120
Total money = 360

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the first 24 days:
- **First 8 Days**: All good.
- **Next 8 Days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 Days**: All neutral.

So, the first 24 days are:
- 8 good days (first 8 days)
- 8 bad days (next 8 days)
- 8 neutral days (next 8 days)

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next day is good.
- The day after that is neutral.
- The day after that is good.

So, the next three days are:
- 1 good day
- 1 neutral day
- 1 good day

Adding these to the first 24 days:
- Total good days: \(8 + 1 + 1 = 10\)
- Total bad days: 8
- Total neutral days: \(8 + 1 = 9\)

Finally, we need to determine how many good days are left in the month. Since the month has 30 days and we have already accounted for 27 days (24 + 3), there are 3 days left in the month.

Since the next three days are already accounted for (2 good and 1 neutral), the number of good days left in the month is:
- 2 good days (from the next three days)

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 8 more toys to have enough for the 12 dogs, so he now has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
4. When James returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, there are 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys to have enough for 24 dogs. Now he has 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 8 other adults. Since each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, the total weight of 8 adults is:

8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Now, let's add Jack's weight. Assuming Jack also weighs 80 kg, the total weight in the elevator would be:

640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

She also adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, so the final length of the dress is \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

First, subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Chris to mow half of his lawn in each mode and then add those times together.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him half of 60 minutes.
   - \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him half of 40 minutes.
   - \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Add the time taken in turtle mode and rabbit mode.
   - \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to add up the time they have already spent walking and subtract that from the total time they have.

First, we add the time it took to get to the corner where the library is and the time it took to get to the fire station:
6 minutes (to the library) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes

Next, we subtract the total time spent walking so far from the total time they have to walk to school:
30 minutes (total time) - 19 minutes (time spent) = 11 minutes

So, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours to minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 = 180 minutes

Now, subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:

180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"First, let's find out the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so five lollipops cost:

5 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $2.00

Now, we can find out how much the four candies cost by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This $1.20 is the cost of four candies, so the cost of one candy is:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30/candy

Now, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. First, the cost of 10 lollipops:

10 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $4.00

And the cost of 10 candies:

10 candies * $0.30/candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives us the total cost:

$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

$7.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years.

First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong.

To find out how many more coins Neil saves:
\[ \text{Additional coins Neil saves} = 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8 \text{ coins} \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years (120 months):
- Rong's total savings:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

- Neil's total savings:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

"First, let's figure out the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract \( 0.60T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of all the fruits together:
- Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 dollars

"To find out how many square feet Brittany's comforter is, we need to calculate the total number of 1-foot by 1-foot squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: The problem states there are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68

"First, let's figure out how many chairs are needed for the adults and babies.

There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so in total, we need:
42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57 chairs

The restaurant has 8 high chairs. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs:
5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs

Now, let's add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find out how many chairs the restaurant already has:
8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48 chairs

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs the restaurant already has from the total number of chairs needed:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream can be made in 48 hours and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many quarts of chocolate ice cream can be made in 48 hours:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- In 48 hours, the number of 2-hour periods is \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \).
- Therefore, the total quarts of chocolate ice cream made in 48 hours is \( 100 \times 24 = 2400 \) quarts.

Next, let's find out how many quarts of vanilla ice cream can be made in 48 hours:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of pizzas and slices:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - Total number of pizzas = 5
   - Total number of slices = 5 * 12 = 60 slices

2. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3
   - Slices eaten by each of these three friends = 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

"First, let's figure out how long it takes the dog to eat nine sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes, and the dog takes 2/3 of that time.

Time for the dog to eat nine sausages:
\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. We do this by adding the times together and dividing by 2.

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

8 feet and 4 inches is the same as:
\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 windows = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows.

"To find out what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the total number of blue spools.

The total number of blue spools is the sum of the light blue and dark blue spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by adding all the spools together:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 40\% \]

2. Calculate the number of people remaining after midday.
3. Determine how many of the remaining people voted by 16:00.
4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Determine how many people had voted by midday:**
   - Total number of people at 8:00 = 5000
   - Fraction of people who voted by midday = 2/5
   - Number of people who voted by midday = 2/5 * 5000 = 2000

2. **Calculate the number of people remaining after midday:**
   - Number of people remaining after midday = Total number of people - Number of people who voted by midday
   - Number of people remaining after midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000

3. **Determine how many of the remaining people voted by 16:00:**
   - Fraction of remaining people who voted by 16:00 = 2/3
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = 2/3 * 3000 = 2000

4. **Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:**
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = Number of people remaining after midday - Number of people who voted by 16:00
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = 3000 - 2000 = 1000

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we add up the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34

"First, let's figure out how many glasses and plates Jeff originally sent for the party.

- He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen glasses equal \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- He also sent 4 dozen plates. So, 4 dozen plates equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we need to account for the broken items:

- 10 glasses were broken, so the number of glasses left is \(96 - 10 = 86\) glasses.
- 6 plates were broken, so the number of plates left is \(48 - 6 = 42\) plates.

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates together to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - She started with 30 small stickers and traded 27, so she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - She started with 40 large stickers and traded 20, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons.
   - 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from remaining large stickers) = 63 small buttons.

8. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 92 buttons.

So, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

"Let's break this down step by step. We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is:
\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS):** 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   \[
   \text{Number of small shirts} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]
3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   \[
   \text{Number of medium shirts} = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]
4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   \[
   \text{Number of large shirts} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   \[
   \text{Number of extra-large shirts} = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can start by figuring out the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \]

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as \( P \). We can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times P = 18 \]

To find \( P \), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):

\[ P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the first house needs half the number of cases as the second house. So, the second house needs \( 2x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house. So, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:

\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To find out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot was, we need to calculate the distance they covered both by driving and hiking.

First, let's determine the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. Since the driving speed is 50 miles per hour, half of that is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, the hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[ 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long they drove. The total travel time was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is:
\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance they drove is the driving time multiplied by the driving speed:
\[ 4.5 \times 50 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to get the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[ 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break down the scoring system and the differences between Ava and Emma's performance.

1. **Points for enemies jumped on:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - If Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, then Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points for enemies: 
     - Emma: \( 10E \)
     - Ava: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)

2. **Points for berries collected:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - If Emma collects \( B \) berries, then Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points for berries:
     - Emma: \( 5B \)
     - Ava: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)

3. **Points for time left on the timer:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - If Emma finishes with \( T \) seconds left, then Ava finishes with \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points for time:
     - Emma: \( 30T \)
     - Ava: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

Now, let's calculate the total scores for both Ava and Emma:

- **Emma's total score:**
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T
  \]

- **Ava's total score:**
  \[
  10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
  \]

The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
(10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = -25
\]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[
-25

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be written as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2(4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Expand and simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

1. One-way distance to work is 5 miles, so the round trip (to and from work) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
2. Andy works 5 days a week, so the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.
3. Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon, so the total amount of gas used per week is 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons.
4. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of gas per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week.

"First, let's figure out the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

She received ten $20 bills, so the total from the twenties is:
10 * $20 = $200

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Now, let's calculate how much she spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount from 3/5 of the twenties is:
3/5 * $200 = $120

So, the total amount she spent on lunch is the sum of the money from the quarters and the money from the twenties:
$35 + $120 = $155

The total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:
$155"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- So, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total number of TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   - One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40.
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   - One-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs.
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \).

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:
   - The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs.
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs).
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25.

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"First, let's find out what the temperature is at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we subtract 33 from 45:

45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.

To prevent the pipes from freezing, Carson needs to keep the temperature above 32 degrees. The current temperature at night is 12 degrees, so we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to increase:

32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the heating effect of one log:

20 / 5 = 4 logs.

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into groups of 9, we divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups:
\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \text{ groups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ groups} \]

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by each group is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ seashells per group} \]

Since there are 6 groups, the total number of seashells brought back is:
\[ 6 \times 18 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. This can be expressed as:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Distribute the 0.30:

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract 0.30x from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide that number by the number of days in a week to find the average per day.

First, we know Felix made $105 in a week. Since he charges $0.25 per branch, we can find the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total money made by the cost per branch.

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7.

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's define the variables:
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
   - The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

2. We know the total mixture fills a 10-ounce jar:
   \[
   z + z + s + s + 2s = 10
   \]
   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2z + 2s + 2s = 10
   \]
   \[
   2z + 4s = 10
   \]

3. Substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation:
   \[
   2z + 4(2z) = 10
   \]
   \[
   2z + 8z = 10
   \]
   \[
   10z = 10
   \]
   \[
   z = 1
   \]

4. Now, find \( s \):
   \[
   s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2
   \]

5. Finally, find the amount of oil:
   \[
   \text{Amount of oil} = 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4

3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

Next, the cost of the cows:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, John spent a total of $4500.

"First, let's figure out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 cars is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine how much money was raised by the students. The total amount raised is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, and they each raised the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250.

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the time from both days.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time from both days:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day:**
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Total tasks per day = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

2. **Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total tasks per week = 150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week.

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Total earnings = 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260.

So, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.

2. **Second Game:**
   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.
   - Julie's score in the first game was 10 points, so Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

3. **Total Points:**
   - Sasha's total points from both games is the sum of the points from the first game and the second game.
   - Total points = \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we first need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food.

For cat food:
8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins

For dog food:
6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food to find the difference:
88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We'll assign variables to the number of cards each person has:

- Let \( P \) be the number of cards PJ has.
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. So, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon, then subtract the refund from the original cost plus the shipping cost.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - Refund amount = $32 * 75% = $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

3. **Calculate the total loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.00
   - Refund amount = $24.00
   - Shipping cost = $3.00
   - Total loss = Original cost - Refund amount + Shipping cost
   - Total loss = $32.00 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00

Milly will lose $11.00.

"To find out how much it will cost Angela to have all her items installed, we need to break down the costs based on what the interior design firm offers and what Angela needs.

First, let's look at what the base installation package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The base installation cost is $129.00.

Now, let's see what Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

We can see that Angela has more items than the base package covers:
- She has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2)
- She has 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1)
- She has 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10)

Each additional item costs $15.00. So, we need to calculate the cost for the extra items:
- 2 extra mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Base installation: $129.00
- Extra mirrors: $30.00
- Extra chandelier: $15.00
- Extra pictures: $150.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $324.00

So, the total cost for Angela will be $324.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height each person can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting height:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting height:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting height:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting height to feet:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then use that to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals. The speed of the kangaroos can be represented as:
   \[
   \text{Speed of kangaroos} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}}
   \]
   Since the distance \(D\) is the same for all animals, we can use this speed to find the time for the turtles.

2. The speed of each turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo:
   \[
   \text{Speed of turtles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take 4 turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). The total speed of 4 turtles is:
   \[
   \text{Total speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{4D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}
   \]

4. The time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \(D\) is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Total speed of 4 turtles}} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's add up the contributions and the amount she still needs to find out how much she has in her purse.

Total amount needed after trade-in: $400
Total contributions (job + mom): $150 + $80 = $230
Amount still needed: $50

So, the total amount she has is the total amount needed minus the amount still needed plus the contributions:
$400 - $50 + $230 = $580

Since the total amount needed after the trade-in is $400 and she still needs $50, the amount she has in her purse is:
$400 - $50 - $230 = $120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years using the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P + (P \times r \times t) \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate.
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) of \( P \) per year. However, the interest rate should be a fraction of the principal, so \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) or 0.75.
- \( t = 3 \) years

First, calculate the interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 675 \]

Now, add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Food Baskets:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green food baskets = 3 * $25 = $75.

2. **Cost of Red Food Baskets:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total cost for red food baskets before discount = 3 * $18 = $54.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Total discount for red food baskets = 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for red food baskets after discount = $54 - $6 = $48.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for all baskets = Cost of green food baskets + Cost of red food baskets after discount.
   - Total cost = $75 + $48 = $123.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of rooms to be cleaned, which is one-half of the 90 rooms.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean these rooms, given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned.
\[ \text{Number of rooms to be cleaned} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms.
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \]

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes. By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built will be 12 + 36 = 48 homes. In the third year, they will double the total amount of homes built by the end of the second year, which is 2 * 48 = 96 homes. Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years will be 48 + 96 = 144 homes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am two years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of all our ages is 87.

Let's use variables to represent each person's age:
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( I \) be my age.
- Let \( S \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the information given:
1. \( I = B - 3 \)
2. \( I = S + 2 \)
3. \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. \( I + B + S + M = 87 \)

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( I \):
\[ S = I - 2 \]

Now, substitute \( I \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation for the sum of the ages:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find my age \( I \):
\[ I = B - 3 \]
\[ I = 16 - 3 \]
\[ I = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks, so we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can find the total by multiplying the number of customers by the amount each gave:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. Therefore, Julieta's total is:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips both Rafaela and Julieta received together, we add their individual totals:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the total amount of tips they received together is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In 1 year, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - We need to find how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber.
   - Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges.
   - The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We'll assign variables to the number of books each person has:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \) books.

According to the problem, the total number of books is 85:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Now, let's combine like terms:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

1. Calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
   - Joelle has 5 orchids.
   - Each orchid has 5 petals.
   - Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

2. Calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
   - Joelle has 4 African daisies.
   - Each daisy has 10 petals.
   - Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

3. Find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
   - Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
   - Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many plants are left after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total number of plants:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the speed of a whirligig is based on the speed of a thingamabob.

We know that:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

So, if a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5 to find the speed of a whirligig.

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

2. **Calculate the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:**
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's lawn: \( J \times 6 \) dollars.
   - Kamala's lawn: \( 3J \times 6 \) dollars.
   - Alba's lawn: \( 5J \times 6 \) dollars.

4. **Sum up the earnings from all lawns:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \) dollars.

5. **Determine the total earnings from all activities:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.

6. **Set up the equation:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from mowing lawns + Earnings from lemonade sales
   - \( 80 = 54J + L \)

7. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - We need to find \( J \) first. Since Joe paid $6 and we don't have the exact number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we assume \( J = 1 \) (the simplest case).
   - If \( J = 1 \), then \( 54J = 54 \) dollars.
   - \( 80 = 54 + L \)
   - \( L = 80 - 54 \)
   - \( L = 26 \)

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.
   - Daniel read 0 pages today.

3. **Calculate the number of pages Denise read today:**
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
   - Denise read 5 more than 13 pages today.
   - So, Denise read \( 13 + 5 = 18 \) pages today.

4. **Total pages read by each:**
   - Denise: \( 10 \) pages yesterday + \( 18 \) pages today = \( 28 \) pages.
   - Daniel: \( 13 \) pages yesterday + \( 0 \) pages today = \( 13 \) pages.

5. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - Denise read \( 28 \) pages.

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he is eating with his adult wife and their two children, and everyone eats one bowl at a meal, we need to figure out how much soup is left after dinner.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soup used for dinner:
- Calvin (1 adult bowl)
- His wife (1 adult bowl)
- Two children (2 child bowls)

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total soup used for dinner is:
- 1 adult bowl + 1 adult bowl + 2 child bowls = 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls

Converting everything to child bowls:
- 2 adult bowls = 4 child bowls
- 4 child bowls + 2 child bowls = 6 child bowls

So, 6 child bowls of soup are used for dinner. The pot originally had 8 child bowls of soup. Therefore, the leftover soup is:
- 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls

Each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will get 1 bowl.

"To find out how much William spent in all, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- William bought 5 notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- So, the total cost for the notebooks is \( 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- William bought 1 ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ballpen is \( 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
- Total cost = Cost of notebooks + Cost of ballpen
- Total cost = \( 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we first calculate the amount of material required for the small and large masks separately, and then add them together.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"First, we need to find out how much water Anthony and his father put into the tank. They filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10,000 gallons, half of that is:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on movies:**
   - Colby saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, each costing $10.
     \[
     5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Colby saw 8 movies on other days, each costing $7.
     \[
     8 \times 7 = 56 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total spent on movies:
     \[
     50 + 56 = 106 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:**
   - Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8.
     \[
     2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Colby had 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2.
     \[
     4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total spent on popcorn and candy:
     \[
     16 + 8 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent so far:**
   \[
   106 + 24 = 130 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining budget:**
   - Colby's total budget is $150.
   - Remaining budget:
     \[
     150 - 130 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine the cost for the last night:**
   - On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, Colby wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy.
   - Cost of the movie on Friday:
     \[
     10 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Cost of the popcorn:
     \[
     8 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Cost of the box of candy:
     \[
     2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost for the last night:
     \[
     10 + 8 + 2 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Check if the remaining budget covers the last night:**
   - Remaining budget is $20, which exactly covers the cost of the movie, popcorn, and candy for the last night.

7. **Determine the number of additional movies Colby can see:**
   - Since the remaining budget is exactly $20 and it is all used up for the last night, Colby cannot see any additional movies.

Therefore, the number of additional movies Colby can see is:

"To find out how many calories the pastries Andrew baked have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin.
3. Multiply the calories of a mini cinnamon roll by the number of mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Multiply the calories of a mini blueberry muffin by the number of mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's find the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins:
- Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday.
2. Count the number of days.
3. Divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, add these numbers together to get the total:

39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Next, count the number of days:

5 days

Finally, divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days to find the average:

300 / 5 = 60

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is:

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance the bus traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The distance the car traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in distance between the bus and the car is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall total number of toys, which is 62.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

First, we add these numbers together:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this total from the overall total number of toys:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

First, substitute \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( Pa \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, find \( P \):
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's figure out how many people are in the water balloon fight. Maria invited 4 friends, and including herself, that makes 5 people.

At the start, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, the friends have:
4 friends * 2 balloons each = 8 balloons

Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.

So, at the start, the total number of balloons is:
8 (friends' balloons) + 1 (Maria's balloon) = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons each = 15 balloons

Now, add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24.

"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spits their seeds.

1. **Zoey's total distance:**
   - Zoey has 40 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 10 feet.
   - Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

2. **Sydney's total distance:**
   - Sydney has 35 seeds.
   - She spits each seed 12 feet.
   - Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

3. **Combined total distance:**
   - Combined total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
   - Combined total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

4. **Average total distance:**
   - To find the average, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (2).
   - Average total distance = Combined total distance / 2
   - Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total earnings from each machine and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine can produce in a month.

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 60
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30

   Total widgets produced in a month:
   \[
   60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets}
   \]

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 45
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30

   Total widgets produced in a month:
   \[
   45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from selling the widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   \[
   43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   \[
   32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between the two machines:
\[
259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours, he pays 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, it would have cost him 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

"First, let's figure out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate the amount for each sheep as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
Three pounds less than this amount: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

Now, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep.

For the goats: \(15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds}\).
For the sheep: \(12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds}\).

Adding these together gives the total amount of hay needed:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- He sells 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- He sells 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two more equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can use these equations to express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find out how many pages are in the book, we first need to determine how many sheets of paper are in 1.5 inches. Since there are 100 pages per inch, and each sheet of paper has two pages (one on each side), we can calculate the number of sheets and then the total number of pages.

1. Calculate the number of sheets in 1.5 inches:
   - 100 pages per inch means 50 sheets per inch (since each sheet has 2 pages).
   - For 1.5 inches: \( 50 \text{ sheets/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 75 \text{ sheets} \).

2. Calculate the total number of pages:
   - Each sheet has 2 pages, so \( 75 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages/sheet} = 150 \text{ pages} \).

Therefore, the book has 150 pages.

"First, let's figure out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, that means he has 24 measuring cups (since 1 dozen equals 12).

To find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has initially:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

"First, let's find out how many beds are initially occupied in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

1000 beds * 1/5 = 200 beds

This means there are 200 occupied beds initially. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds at the start is:

1000 beds - 200 beds = 800 beds

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

These 700 patients will occupy 700 beds over the 2 weeks. Now, we need to find out the total number of unoccupied beds after these 700 patients are admitted. Initially, there were 800 unoccupied beds, and 700 of these will be occupied by the new patients:

800 beds - 700 beds = 100 beds

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, let's break down the information step by step.

1. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.
2. Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. The remainder of the emails are 16 - 7 = 9 emails.
4. Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) emails are to family.
5. This leaves 9 - 6 = 3 emails that are not to family or work.
6. One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \) email is to her boyfriend.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"First, let's find out how old Shawna is. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years old

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes was four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day.

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day:
   - First day: 10 holes

2. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the second day:
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Total by end of second day: 10 + 13 = 23 holes

3. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
   - Third day: 8 holes
   - Total by end of third day: 23 + 8 = 31 holes
   - They filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes by the end of the third day is: 31 - 2 = 29 holes

4. Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
   - By the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes was four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day.
   - Four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day: 4 * 10 = 40 holes

5. Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day: 40 holes
   - Total holes by the end of the third day: 29 holes
   - Holes dug on the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes

The pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To find out how much the travel costs, we first need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and then add that to the original cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400.

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost for the travel tickets is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
2. Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( W \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Together they have caught 339 Pokemon: \( A + S + W = 339 \)
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( A = S + 5 \)
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: \( S = 4W - 13 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation:

1. \( A = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4W - 13 \)

Substitute \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4W - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance the bird traveled in each direction and then sum the distances traveled southward and subtract the distance traveled northward.

1. **Distance traveled southward for the first part:**
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Distance traveled northward:**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Distance traveled southward for the second part:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances traveled southward and subtract the distance traveled northward:

- Total distance southward: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance northward: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net distance traveled southward:
- \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \)

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the start of the day.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all the quantities to individual brownies, knowing that 1 dozen equals 12 brownies.

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, add these amounts to find the total number of brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, calculate the number of brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"First, let's figure out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington has after giving some away.

She started with 12 boxes and gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, she gave away a total of:
2 + 2 = 4 boxes

Now, subtract the boxes she gave away from the total she bought:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes

Next, she kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. To find out how many boxes that is, we calculate:
1/4 * 8 = 2 boxes

So, she kept 2 boxes and sold the rest. To find out how many boxes she sold, we subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes:
8 - 2 = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 * 20 = 120 oranges

   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine his dad's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

3. **Determine his dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed and how many more she needs to buy.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet, we'll convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet:
12 inches = 1 foot

Each flower needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next flower. Therefore, the total space each flower and its gap take up is:
1 foot (flower) + 1.5 feet (gap) = 2.5 feet

Next, we calculate how many flowers can fit in the 111-foot flower bed:
111 feet / 2.5 feet per flower = 44.4

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number:
44 flowers

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
44 flowers - 17 flowers = 27 flowers

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost for 27 flowers is:
27 flowers * $6 per flower = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil after planting the sunflowers and carnations is:

"To solve this, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them: 
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To cook 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number she can cook in one batch and then multiply by the time it takes to cook one batch:

   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the room cools by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Total Cooling:**
   - The total cooling effect is \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.

4. **Warming Up for 2 Hours:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the room warms up by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

5. **Final Temperature Change:**
   - The final temperature change is the total cooling minus the warming up.
   - Final temperature change = \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old when he saw the comet the second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Therefore, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time, and the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, and these trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in a day.

2. **Determine the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) flights.

3. **Determine the number of remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) flights.

4. **Determine the number of flights to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) flights.

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
   - Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Combined howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
   - Combined howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the combined howl duration to minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

First, we know Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which means his father gave him:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

The cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"First, let's find out how many cookies were brought to the wedding. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give 1/2 of these cookies to the church next door.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 \text{ cookies} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find out how many people were in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the size of each slice:**
   - Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \).
   - Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

2. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   - There are 4 kids, so the total size of the kids' slices is \( 4x \).
   - There are 2 adults, so the total size of the adults' slices is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).

3. **Calculate the total size of the watermelon:**
   - The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices: \( 4x + 4x = 8x \).

4. **Determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:**
   - Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).
   - The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

"To figure out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from the time she wants the cake to be ready.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

First, let's add up all the minutes:
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. So, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest time she can start.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's call the number of chocolate bars in a box \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost and then determine the earnings. However, the problem does not specify the revenue or the fee charged per student, so I'll assume we are calculating the total cost instead of earnings.

1. Calculate the cost of renting the studio per session:
   - Cost per session = $25

2. Calculate the cost per student per session:
   - Cost per student per session = $1.50
   - Total cost for 10 students per session = 10 students * $1.50/student = $15

3. Calculate the total cost per session:
   - Total cost per session = Cost of renting the studio + Total cost for students
   - Total cost per session = $25 + $15 = $40

4. Calculate the total cost per week:
   - The studio is rented 3 days a week
   - Total cost per week = 3 sessions/week * $40/session = $120

5. Calculate the total cost per month:
   - Assuming 4 weeks in a month
   - Total cost per month = 4 weeks/month * $120/week = $480

Since the problem asks for the expected earnings and does not provide revenue information, the total cost is the best we can calculate. If earnings are meant to be calculated, additional information such as the fee charged per student is needed.

"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population of 50 porcupines.

Number of female porcupines = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \)

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:

Babies born each month = 30 females \(\times\) 4 babies/female = 120 babies

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Babies born in a year = 120 babies/month \(\times\) 12 months = 1440 babies

The total population at the end of the year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year:

Total population = Initial population + Babies born in a year
Total population = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Use the volume to find out how many gallons of water are needed.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

First, we calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we convert the volume to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge of the power bank to determine its initial charge when Maria went to the park.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours at 7% Loss:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( C \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( C - 0.07C = 0.93C \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.93C - 0.07 \times 0.93C = 0.93^2C \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.93^3C \).

   Given that the final charge is 28%, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.93^3C = 0.28
   \]

2. **Solve for \( C \):**
   \[
   C = \frac{0.28}{0.93^3}
   \]
   \[
   C = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348

"First, let's figure out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, let's calculate how much Janet makes in a week. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total earnings per hour are:

$10 + $15 = $25 per hour

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

$25 * 40 = $1,000 per week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2,000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

$2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to figure out the rate at which he reads and then use that to calculate the total time for 18 pages.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. This means his reading rate is:
\[ \text{Reading rate} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Reading rate}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To find out how many guests the hotel now has, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests becomes:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests becomes:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the number of guests becomes:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the price of a large stuffed animal:**
   - Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
   - A large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one.
   - Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.
   - The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \) dollars.
   - The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times x = 12x \) dollars.
   - The total earnings from all sales is $120.

3. **Write the equation for total earnings:**
   \[
   8x + 12x = 120
   \]

4. **Combine like terms and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   20x = 120
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{120}{20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Determine the number of small stuffed animals sold:**
   - Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, and she sold twice as many small ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).
   - Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Now, let's add the earnings from the cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
$80 + $240 = $320

Next, we need to subtract the amount she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10:
2 sisters * $10/sister = $20

Finally, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings:
$320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"First, let's figure out how much ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.

1. A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so that's \(24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes:
4. \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches based on the given information that the prices are proportional.

First, let's look at the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this cost to find the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches:
- The cost for 8 sandwiches would be 8 * $1.50 = $12.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. Sally had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst:

40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst

So, the number of red balloons left is:
25 - 10 = 15 red balloons

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She had 12 yellow balloons initially:

Half of 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released

So, the number of yellow balloons left is:
12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her clutch:

75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons

Now, let's add up all the balloons Sally has left:
- Red balloons: 15

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he does not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a substitute is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension to the whole class.
     - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 0.40
     - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 1 - 0.40 = 0.60
   - If Marcus doesn't get a class extension, there's a 20% chance he can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment.
     - Probability of getting a personal extension: 0.20
     - Probability of not getting a personal extension: 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

3. **Combining the Probabilities:**
   - Probability of not turning in homework if the normal teacher is there:
     - Class extension: 0.40
     - Personal extension: 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12
     - Total probability of not turning in homework with the normal teacher: 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.52

4. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Probability of not turning in homework (substitute teacher): 0.50
   - Probability of not turning in homework (normal teacher): 0.50 * 0.52 = 0.26
   - Total probability of not turning in homework: 0.50 + 0.26 = 0.76

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place and then calculate the total time it will take him to drop the candy into each bottle.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the total time to drop the candy:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he doesn't need to move to reach it.
   - He then moves to the next 7 bottles (since he starts at the first one).
   - Time to move from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds.
   - Total time to move between bottles = 7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college and the income he lost by not working, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total cost of college = 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the income lost by not working:**
   - Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the cost of college and the lost income:**
   - Total amount = Total cost of college + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = 3 * $25,000/year = $75,000/year.

5. **Determine how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 with his new income:**
   - Time required = Total amount / New income = $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider on each side.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
4. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. 

To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here:
- Initial Value = $20,000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% or 0.21
- Number of Years = 2010 - 2007 = 3

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, calculate \(0.79^3\):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493 = 9860 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is:

   - Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.
   - Over 30 days, she drinks \( 8 \times 30 = 240 \) cups of water.

2. Next, convert the total number of cups to gallons.
   - There are 16 cups in a gallon.
   - To find the number of gallons, divide the total number of cups by the number of cups in a gallon: \( \frac{240}{16} = 15 \) gallons.

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend and twice that number (100 people) board the train:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend from the train:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
110

"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, let's break down the costs of each item she bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.

"To find out the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to calculate how many tiles you will need and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. First, determine the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with sides of 1 foot, the area of one tile is:
   \[
   1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total number of tiles needed to cover the kitchen floor. The kitchen floor area is 200 SqFt, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area of the kitchen floor}}{\text{Area of one tile}} = \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}
   \]

3. Finally, calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's figure out how many loads Greg does each week:
- For the 4 twin beds, since he can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he will need to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.
- For the 1 king size bed, he will need to do 1 load for the king size bed.

So, each week, Greg does 2 (for twin beds) + 1 (for the king bed) = 3 loads of laundry.

Next, to find out how many loads he does in a year, we multiply the weekly loads by the number of weeks in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year, so 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads per year.

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to add up the stickers he had and collected over the past years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers at the end of last year.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which means he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers this year.

Adding this year's stickers to his collection, Leo now has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food the cats consume each day and then see how many days that amount can be sustained with 720 grams of food.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food the cats eat in one feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - So, 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams per feeding.

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, we need to calculate the total daily consumption:
   - 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of food will last:
   - 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - There were 4 pizzas.
   - Each pizza had 8 slices.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total slices eaten (31) is less than the total slices available (32), the calculation is correct.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's call the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, took:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. Cost of the cast: $200
2. Cost of the visit: $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit, which is 0.5 hours. So, $300 * 0.5 = $150
3. Cost of the painkillers: $4 per pill for 30 pills, so $4 * 30 = $120
4. Cost of parking: $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

"First, let's figure out how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
70% of 20 = 0.70 * 20 = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club has:
20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means:
2 * 20 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
80% of 40 = 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team has:

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of big coupons:
- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is \(700 \times 2 = 1400\).

Next, we calculate the cost for the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, the total cost for the small coupons is \(700 \times 5 = 3500\) cents.

Then, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. So, the total cost for the big coupons is \(1400 \times 15 = 21000\) cents.

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
- Total cost in cents is \(3500 + 21000 = 24500\) cents.

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):
- Total cost in dollars is \(24500 \div 100 = 245\).

So, Anthony spends $245 on postage.

"To find out how much it will cost Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs.
2. Calculate the cost with the promotion.

Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need:
\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound of butter per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

The grocery store has a promotion: buy one pound of butter, get one half off. This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis pays for 1.5 pounds.

First, we calculate the cost for 2 pounds of butter:
\[ 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 = \$4.00 \]
\[ 0.5 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 = \$2.00 \]
\[ \text{Total for 2 pounds} = \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00 \]

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we calculate the total cost for 6 pounds:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per set}} = 3 \text{ sets} \]
\[ 3 \text{ sets} \times \$6.00 \text{ per set} = \$18.00 \]

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break down the information given:

1. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days).
2. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
3. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.
4. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.
5. The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day is 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.
6. The number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day minus the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys each day: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

"First, let's figure out how much Jenny spends on the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, we can calculate the cost in two ways: by the dozen or by individual roses.

1. **By the dozen:** A dozen roses cost $15, so for 12 roses, she pays $15. She has 3 more roses to buy, and each rose costs $2, so 3 roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.
2. **By individual price:** Each rose costs $2, so 15 roses cost 15 * $2 = $30. However, this method is not the most cost-effective, and since the problem suggests a better deal for a dozen, we'll use the first method.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which totals 5 * $5 = $25.

She spends $21 on the roses, so her change is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $4 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so $4 is equivalent to 4 / 0.25 = 16 quarters.

"To find out how much Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.
- Cost of 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Cost of 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Now, we find the savings:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

   - Over 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \).

2. Calculate the total number of bales the truck picks up:
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \).

3. Calculate the number of bales left in the field:
   - The number of bales left is the total number of bales made minus the total number of bales picked up.
   - \( 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \).

So, the number of bales left in the field is 12.

"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a week. He has 6 periods a day for 5 days, plus 2 extra classes each day for 5 days.

\[ 6 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ periods/week} \]
\[ 2 \text{ extra classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ extra classes/week} \]
\[ 30 \text{ periods/week} + 10 \text{ extra classes/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week} \]

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total minutes spent in class each week is:

\[ 40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, John spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday. First, calculate the total extra learning time:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes/week}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

So, the total time spent learning each week is:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes/week}}{60} = 28.33 \text{ hours/week} \]

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is:
   \[
   3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Determine the height of the first bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Calculate the height of the second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of the height of the first bounce, so:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the height of the fourth child is:
\[
72 \text{ inches}
\]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors had scavenged half of what was left. This means the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the velociraptors ate.
3. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were \( 270 \times 2 = 540 \) kilograms of meat.
4. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means the 540 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate.
5. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were \( 540 \times 2 = 1080 \) kilograms of meat.

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are needed.

First, calculate the area of the north and south walls:
- Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
- Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
- Since there are two such walls, total area = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

Next, calculate the area of the east and west walls:
- Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
- Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
- Since there are two such walls, total area = 40 square feet * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Determine how many gallons of paint are needed:
- One gallon covers 20 square feet.
- Number of gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

Finally, calculate the total cost:
- Cost per gallon = $12.
- Total cost = 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

"First, let's figure out the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is:
31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off:
20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

So, the number of days he works is:
50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps each day is:
2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Now, to find out how many people he helps over the 40 days he works:
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

"First, let's figure out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's miles = 3.5 * Amber's miles
Micah's miles = 3.5 * 8
Micah's miles = 28

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( x \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).
4. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. So, \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x}{15} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 15:

\[
x = 6 \times 15

"To solve this, we need to break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the annual amount Lauren saves:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

2. **Determine the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Annual retirement income needed = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount Lauren needs for 20 years of retirement:**
   - Total retirement savings needed = Annual retirement income needed * 20 years = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

4. **Determine how many years Lauren needs to save to reach her retirement goal:**
   - Total savings needed = $800,000.
   - Annual savings = $20,000.
   - Number of years needed to save = Total savings needed / Annual savings = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

   - The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys.
   - Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is:
   \[
   400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour.
   - The total production by the fifth worker is:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times x \text{ toys/hour} = 10x \text{ toys}
   \]

4. **Set up the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   - The total production by all 5 workers is the sum of the production by the first 4 workers and the fifth worker:
   \[
   200 \text{ toys} + 10x \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   10x = 380 - 200
   \]
   \[
   10x = 180
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{180}{10}
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To find out how much Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is 105 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The remaining stickers Luis had are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris, so Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
6. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris had is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).

Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and this is equal to 16, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( S \), multiply both sides by 4:
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"First, let's find out how many M&M's John has in total from the 3 large bags.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags:
10 ounces/bag * 3 bags = 30 ounces

Since there are 30 M&M's in an ounce, the total number of M&M's is:
30 M&M's/ounce * 30 ounces = 900 M&M's

Now, if John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is:
900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate what half the circumference of the earth is. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car:
\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago.
6. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9
   \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.

2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

3. **Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \).**
   - Then, Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.

4. **Set up the equation for the total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:**
   \[
   S + (S + 12) = 30
   \]
   \[
   2S + 12 = 30
   \]
   \[
   2S = 18
   \]
   \[
   S = 9
   \]

5. **So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted:**
   \[
   S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
   \]

6. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:**
   - Arnold and Madeline together painted the remaining eggs.
   - Total eggs painted by all four: 56
   - Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah: 30
   - Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline: \( 56 - 30 = 26 \)

7. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:**
   - Let the number of eggs each painted be \( A \).
   - Then, \( 2A = 26 \)
   \[
   A = 13
   \]

8. **How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - Difference: \( 21 - 13 = 8 \)

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"First, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons. We do this by dividing 200 by 8:

200 ÷ 8 = 25

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons. This means he will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight of each box:

25 boxes × 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons × 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the weight of the boxes and the weight of the crayons:

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16:

400 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

"First, we need to find out how much of the tree can be used for logs. Since John can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate:

80 feet * 80% = 64 feet

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the 64 feet of usable tree:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each of these logs, John can cut 5 planks:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, if each plank is sold for $1.2, the total amount John makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

So, Grandma's speed on the beach is 1 mile per 20 minutes.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. We know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using her speed on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

So, Jane has saved $32 so far. She wants to save a total of $60. Let's find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the additional $28, if she continues to save $4 each week.

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Finally, we add the number of blue birds in the 1 tree that had 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles from the 36 he has, we can calculate the new total:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that allows Donny to drink the mixed water. 

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - The temperature of the first mug is 33 degrees.
   - Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug.
   - Donny pours 1 ounce from the second mug.
   - The final temperature of the mixed water must be at least 40 degrees.

2. **Set up the equation for the final temperature:**
   - Let \( T \) be the temperature of the water in the second mug.
   - The total amount of water mixed is 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, which totals 5 ounces.
   - The final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs.

   The equation for the final temperature is:
   \[
   T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
   \]

3. **Set the final temperature to the minimum acceptable temperature:**
   - We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees.
   \[
   40 = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - First, multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:
   \[
   40 \times 5 = 4 \times 33 + T
   \]
   \[
   200 = 132 + T
   \]
   - Subtract 132 from both sides to isolate \( T \):
   \[
   T = 200 - 132
   \]
   \[
   T = 68
   \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the 21 days and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20
3. **Number of days**: 21

   Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

   Total cows after 21 days = Initial cows + Cows added
   Total cows after 21 days = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

4. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
5. **Chickens added per day**: 10
6. **Number of days**: 21

   Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

   Total chickens after 21 days = Initial chickens + Chickens added
   Total chickens after 21 days = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so:

4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

Since Russell gets a 10% discount on the total cost, we need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the total cost:

10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

So, the total cost after the discount is:

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find out how much each single bagel costs. Since each pack has 9 bagels and he ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:

4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

Finally, the cost per bagel is:

$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops.

To find the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion based on the ratio of potatoes to scoops:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3 * 18 = 2 * x
54 = 2x
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

Number of red jelly beans = 2 × 17
Number of red jelly beans = 34

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

Number of blue jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans - (Number of green jelly beans + Number of red jelly beans)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - 51

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Mason eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays, so:
  \( 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \)

- On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), Mason eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend, so:
  \( 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \)

Now, we add the carrots eaten during the weekdays and the weekend:
\( 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \)

So, Mason eats 30 carrots a week.

"To find out how much profit Linus earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the devices bought.
3. Determine the total revenue from selling all the devices.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
- Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount.
- Selling price = 2 * $20 = $40

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the devices bought.
- Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday.
- Total number of devices = 2 + 4 = 6
- Total cost = 6 * $20 = $120

Step 3: Determine the total revenue from selling all the devices.
- Total revenue = 6 * $40 = $240

Step 4: Calculate the profit.
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $240 - $120 = $120

Therefore, the profit Linus earned is $120.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bottles of carrot juice are required to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce beyond its current production capacity.

1. **Determine the number of bottles needed to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of one person:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy needs, we need:
     \[
     \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - If one person needs 5 bottles, then 2300 people will need:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - The additional number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.
4. Determine his weekly earnings based on the number of collections and the rate he gets paid.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
- The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two, so it has \(400 \times 0.60 = 240\) more apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Step 2: Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
- Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\).

Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.
- He collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\).

Step 4: Determine his weekly earnings.
- He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\).

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

"To find out how many total fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production for each year based on the information given:

1. **5-year-old tree:** Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree:** Produces 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits), so it produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree:** Produces 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits), so it produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree:** Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces first.
5. **9-year-old tree:** Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree:** Produces 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits), so it produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can determine the production for the 8-year-old tree:
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so it produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

Next, we sum up the total production for each year from 5 to 10 years:
- 5 years: 50 fruits
- 6 years: 150 fruits
- 7 years: 350 fruits
- 8 years: 800 fruits
- 9 years: 0 fruits
- 10 years: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced over 10 years:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The total length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Money Left with Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

So, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(2\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, let's determine how much of the mural is yellow:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is:
  \[
  \frac{12 \text{ pints}}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how much paint is used for the other three colors (red, white, and purple):
- The remaining half of the mural is:
  \[
  12 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
  \]

Since the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple:
- Each of these colors (red, white, and purple) uses:
  \[
  \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
  \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples.
3. He put one apple in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
4. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground.
5. Newton picked up the 5 apples, put 4 in his pocket, and threw 1 at the tree.
6. This caused 6 more apples to fall.
7. Now, he has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground.
8. Newton picked up all 6 apples and put them in his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:
1 (initially in pocket) + 4 (from the second pick-up) + 6 (from the final pick-up) = 11

"To find out how much Ali's order costs, we need to first determine how many 50 kg bags of coal he ordered. We do this by dividing the total weight of the coal by the weight of each bag:

850 kg / 50 kg/bag = 17 bags

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

17 bags * $18/bag = $306

So, the total cost of Ali's order is $306.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices Kate's friends will eat:
6 friends * 6 slices each = 36 slices

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to find out how many whole cheese pizzas are required:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

Next, calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices Kate's friends will eat:
6 friends * 4 slices each = 24 slices

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

Now, add the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day. 

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran a total of \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(9 + 10 = 19\) miles.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many snowballs Jay actually makes in an hour, considering the melting. 

- Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour.
- In an hour, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes, and 2 snowballs melt in each interval.
- So, in one hour, 2 snowballs * 4 intervals = 8 snowballs melt.

Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay makes in an hour is:
20 (made) - 8 (melted) = 12 snowballs per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs.

- If Jay makes 12 snowballs per hour, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the number of snowballs made per hour:
60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - So, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \( x - 38 \) bandages left.
   - After ordering one bulk pack, they had \( x - 38 + 50 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \( ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 \) bandages left.

4. **Final Condition:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 = 78
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   (x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25) = 78
   \]
   \[
   (x + 50 - 38 - 28 + 100 - 25) = 78
   \]
   \[
   (x + 59) = 78
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 78 - 59
   \]
   \[
   x = 19
   \]

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 19.

"To find out how much May's haircut and color cost, we need to calculate the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut separately, and then add them together.

1. The cost of the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of the hair cut off is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Now, we calculate the cost of the haircut:
- Cost of haircut = 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60

Next, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
- Total cost = Cost of color + Cost of haircut = $40 + $60 = $100

So, the total cost for May's cut and color is $100.

"To find out how much Jen will receive for April, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly work and her attendance bonus.

First, calculate her weekly earnings from her hourly work:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, so she works \(7.5 \times 6 = 45\) hours a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly earnings from her hourly work are \(45 \times 1.5 = 67.5\) dollars.

Next, calculate her monthly earnings from her hourly work:
- There are 4 weeks in April, so her monthly earnings from her hourly work are \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Now, add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
- Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total attendance bonus is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, add her monthly earnings from her hourly work and her attendance bonus:
- Total earnings for April = \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, let's find the cost per bottle of cognac:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 50\% \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:

"First, let's figure out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day.

He planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted:
20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees he planted on the second day is:
20 (from the first day) + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more on the second day than he did on the first day. So, the additional number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the second day is:
40 * 1/4 = 10 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the second day is:
40 (from the first day) + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees.
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:

   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}

5. On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, including Fred. So, there are 4 people in total (Fred + 3 others).

To find out how much root beer each person can drink, we divide the remaining 8 gallons by 4 people:

Now, we solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
   \[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4:

- Height of the first floor = 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.

Finally, we find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof:
- Height from the second floor's floor to the roof = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor.
- Height from the second floor's floor to the roof = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

   \text{Volume} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective Volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

So, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To find out how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**
   - Total cost = Cost before increase + Cost after increase
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all her visits to the museum.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for all the students to try the escape room, given that only 8 students can participate at a time and each session lasts 45 minutes.

1. **Determine the total number of students who get to try the escape room:**
   - There are 10 students from each grade.
   - There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th).
   - Total number of students = 10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students.

2. **Determine the number of groups needed:**
   - Each group can have 8 students.
   - Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

3. **Determine the total time required:**
   - Each group takes 45 minutes.
   - Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"Let's call the length of the shorter piece \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To find out how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he will need, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs. 

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds needed for 80 meatballs by dividing 80 by 16:

\[ \text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[ \text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes:**
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - This can be written as: \( b = 3c - 2 \).

3. **Determine the total number of treats:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.
   - This can be written as: \( c + b = 10 \).

5. **Substitute the expression for \( b \) into the total treats equation:**
   - Substitute \( b = 3c - 2 \) into \( c + b = 10 \):
   - \( c + (3c - 2) = 10 \).

6. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - Combine like terms: \( 4c - 2 = 10 \).
   - Add 2 to both sides: \( 4c = 12 \).
   - Divide by 4: \( c = 3 \).

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a basic pedicure is $40. Together, they cost:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the discounted price for both services is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which totals 10 nails. The cost per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure, we get:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, Karen would pay:
\[ 90 \]

"First, let's find out what the price of the toy was in December after it increased by 80%.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by 80% of $40.

80% of $40 is calculated as:
0.80 * $40 = $32

So, the price in December was:
$40 + $32 = $72

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price was reduced by half.

50% of $72 is:
0.50 * $72 = $36

So, the price in January after the discount was:
$72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To find out how much Charlie makes in a day, we need to calculate the earnings from both types of lessons and then add them together.

1. **Standard Rate Lessons:**
   - Charlie charges $80 per hour.
   - He has 4 lessons at this rate.
   - Total earnings from standard rate lessons = 4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320.

2. **Veteran Rate Lessons:**
   - The rate for veterans is reduced by 25%.
   - 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.
   - Reduced rate for veterans = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.
   - He has 2 lessons at this rate.
   - Total earnings from veteran rate lessons = 2 lessons * $60/lesson = $120.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings for the day = Earnings from standard rate lessons + Earnings from veteran rate lessons.
   - Total earnings = $320 + $120 = $440.

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440.

"To solve this, let's break down the time it takes for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel half the distance on land and half the distance in water.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes to travel each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**: 
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time:

"To find out how much time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.
- Over 4 weeks, the total meditation time is 210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- In one week, she practices yoga for 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.
- Over 4 weeks, the total yoga time is 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice.

"First, let's figure out how much money Ryan has after 3 weeks of doing his chores. Since he gets $6 each week, we multiply $6 by 3 weeks:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So, Ryan has $18.

Next, we need to calculate how much he spent on ice cream cones. He bought one for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 ice cream cones. Each cone costs $1.25, so we multiply $1.25 by 4:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \]

So, Ryan spent $5 on ice cream cones.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on ice cream from his total money:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Ryan has $13 left.

Finally, we need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy with $13. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we divide $13 by $6.50:

"To find out how much profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of making one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and subtract the total cost to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the cost of making one jar:**
   - Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
   - Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
   - Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
   - Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Revenue from selling 10 jars = 10 * $50 = $500

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

   - Half of 16 is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.

2. **Petri Dishes:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
   - Two more than 14 is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

3. **Beakers:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
   - However, he lost some beakers on the way to the lab bench.

4. **Total Items on the Lab Bench:**
   - The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29.

Now, let's set up the equation to find out how many beakers Igor lost.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost.

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes he actually placed there:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - So, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ c + k = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so:
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
