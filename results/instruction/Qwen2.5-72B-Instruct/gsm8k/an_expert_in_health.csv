"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total costs from this value.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: $80,000
2. **Cost of Repairs**: $50,000
3. **Total Costs**: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house:

4. **Increase in Value**: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
5. **New Value of the House**: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, we calculate the profit:

6. **Profit**: New Value - Total Costs = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, Josh's profit is:

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed the entire flock needs per day.
3. Determine how much feed has already been given in the morning and afternoon.
4. Subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much is needed for the final meal.

Step 1: Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

Step 2: Wendi has 20 chickens, so the total daily feed requirement for the flock is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Step 3: Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total amount of feed given by the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Step 4: The amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses where every second glass is 60% of the regular price, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

Since this pattern repeats every two glasses, we can calculate the cost for each pair of glasses:
- Cost for one pair (two glasses) = $5 + $3 = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs of glasses:
- Total cost = 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
3. After selling at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
6. After selling at the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which is given as 5.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken:
- 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles
- 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles

So, she has already spent:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to complete the trail in 3 hours. Therefore, the remaining time she has is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to walk is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

   - The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters.

2. **Account for the spill:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining orange drink is 9 liters.
   - The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

4. **Sum the amounts of water:**
   - Total water in the remaining 24 liters (9 liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink): \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels:
   \[
   \text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

2. Next, determine how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron:
   \[
   \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts consumed in 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine the cost per yogurt.
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
\[ \frac{5.00 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts.
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/yogurt} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours based on the given time distribution.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles/hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles/hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine the number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.**

- The bag has 5 servings.
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

**Step 2: Determine the number of calories you can still consume.**

- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Calories you can still consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

**Step 3: Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.**

- Each serving is 250 calories and the bag is 300g.
- Therefore, each serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60g.
- To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we use the ratio of calories to grams:
  - 250 calories = 60g
  - 1 calorie = 60g / 250 calories = 0.24g
  - 200 calories = 200 * 0.24g = 48g

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00. Therefore, for 20 candles:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially from the total used to find out how many were in the package.

First, we know that Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. This means she used 220 Post-it notes in total.

Next, we know that she started with 80 Post-it notes and ended up with 23 Post-it notes remaining. We can calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had before using any:

\[ \text{Total Post-it notes} = \text{Initial Post-it notes} + \text{Post-it notes in the package} \]

We also know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 left:

\[ \text{Total Post-it notes} - 220 = 23 \]

Let's solve for the total number of Post-it notes:

\[ \text{Total Post-it notes} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Now, we can find out how many Post-it notes were in the package by subtracting the initial number of Post-it notes from the total:

\[ \text{Post-it notes in the package} = \text{Total Post-it notes} - \text{Initial Post-it notes} \]
\[ \text{Post-it notes in the package} = 243 - 80 = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes by multiplying the total number of students by the charge per student.

First, let's find the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\) students.

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total amount is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\) dollars.

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in one week.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16, we can work our way down:

- 4th level: 16 square feet
- 3rd level: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) square feet
- 2nd level: \(32 \times 2 = 64\) square feet
- 1st level: \(64 \times 2 = 128\) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total food for 180 days: \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining days of the year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days: \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total food for 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total food for the first year:**
   - Total food: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.

"First, let's determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the fog bank is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

The city is 42 miles across. To find the total time it takes to cover 42 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times 3.3333 \]
\[ \text{Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of how many pieces Poppy and her mom place and then determine how many pieces are left.

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after Poppy places her pieces, there are:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

2. Her mom then places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after her mom places her pieces, there are:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. Finally, we multiply that by 3 to get the total volume.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume = \( 3 \) inches × \( 4 \) inches × \( 2 \) inches
   - Inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × Number of boxes
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \) cubic inches × 3
   - Total inner volume = \( 72 \) cubic inches

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and then solve for the unknown.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: He watched 1-hour episodes each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours

2. **Wednesday**: He watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday as \(x\).
   - Total for Wednesday: \(0.5x\) hours

3. **Thursday**: He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours

4. **Friday**: He watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours

Now, we know the total TV watching time for the week is 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine the known values:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5. So, before dropping the cookies, he had:
   \[ 110 + 5 = 115 \text{ cookies} \]

2. These 115 cookies are 15 more than he intended to bake. So, the number of cookies he intended to bake is:
   \[ 115 - 15 = 100 \text{ cookies} \]

3. He intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. Therefore, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
   \[ \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of both combined.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We can set up the following proportion to find out how many parts of the total 120 correspond to the sugar:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Where \( x \) is the number of teaspoons of sugar. To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply and solve the equation:

\[
7 \times 120 = 20 \times x
\]

\[
840 = 20x
\]

\[
x = \frac{840}{20}
\]

\[
x = 42

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. According to the information provided, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles that were already there on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, we can calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.

\[ 40000 = L + 0.30L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% from his salary four years ago.

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we need to find the percentage increase in Adrien's salary and apply it to Lylah's salary.

Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

\[ 99076.92 \]"

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of price increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to calculate how many two-month periods are in 36 months.
   \[
   \text{Number of increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

2. **Calculate the price after each increase**: Each increase is 20% of the original price, which means the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20%) after each increase.

3. **Apply the increase 18 times**: The formula to calculate the final price after 18 increases is:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]
   Substituting the original price of $20:

\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his walking routine on weekdays and weekends. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

- On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles a day. So, for 5 weekdays, he walks:
  \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \)

- On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day. So, for 2 weekend days, he walks:
  \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \)

Adding these together gives the total miles walked in a week:
\( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \)

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat**: $25
2. **Cost of the jacket**: The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75
   \]
3. **Cost of the pants**: The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost.
4. Calculate the cost of lemons based on the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. They made a profit of $25. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = 3 \text{ (lemons)} + 2 \text{ (sugar)} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made. The total cost is:
\[ C = 5G \]

The total revenue is the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total number of glasses is:
\[ \text{Total glasses} = 20G \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \]

Now we can set up the equation for profit:
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 5G \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount after Donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount after Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amounts Given to Daughter and Wife:**
   \[
   \text{Amount to Daughter} = 200 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first event is 2 times more likely than the second event.
   - To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
     \[
     (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

Therefore, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, but since the interest is compounded monthly and the payments are made at the end of the period, we can simply apply the interest rate for each month.

The formula to calculate the amount after interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 2\% = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \) months

"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year:
   - Josie has a 10-acre farm.
   - Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
   - Total tons of grapes = 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons.

2. Calculate the total barrels of wine produced from the grapes:
   - Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.
   - Total barrels of wine = 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we can break down his cheese consumption by meal:

1. **Lunch (sandwiches):**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Breakfast (omelets):**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Dinner (macaroni and cheese):**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up the total cheese slices used for all meals:
\[ 14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is:

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests: 71.
2. Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.
3. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
4. The sum of the five highest scores (after removing the lowest score) will be \( 367 + x \).
5. To achieve an average of 93, the sum of these five scores divided by 5 should equal 93:
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367

"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 5 rides/week * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week.
- Total kilometers for four weeks = 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 2 rides/week * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week.
- Total kilometers for three weeks = 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

Adding the kilometers from both periods:
- Total kilometers = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

1. **Weight of Chocolate Bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 bars * 40g/bar = 1000g.

2. **Weight of Candied Apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of candied apples = 80 apples * 20g/apple = 1600g.

3. **Total Weight of the Bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of chocolate bars + weight of candied apples
   - Total weight = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. This means:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. This means:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes}
   \]

Now, we add up the number of cakes bought each day:
\[
4 + 12 + 60 = 76

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates = 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups.
   - Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the amount she needs by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white chickens than red chickens. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens:
\[ W = R + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter and Gary's walking speed into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers + 50 more = 150 customers.
3. Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \).
4. The total number of customers over the three days is given as 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we first need to determine the points scored by each of the other students and then subtract these from the total points.

1. **Naomi's Score**: Given as 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Score**: Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Adding 10 to this, Yuri's score is \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. **Brianna's Score**: Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, Brianna's score is \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Thus, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. **First Round of Recycling**: From these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 pens to make 1 new pen. Therefore, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. **Second Round of Recycling**: Now, he has 5 new pens. From these, he can again mix the ink from 5 pens to make 1 new pen. So, he can make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.
4. **Total Pens**: Adding up all the pens, he initially had 25 pens, plus 5 from the first round of recycling, plus 1 from the second round of recycling.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:
25 + 5 + 1 = 31

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information and setting up the equations.

1. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
3. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Now, solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

2. Multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks to get the total hours for the entire movie.
3. Calculate the total cost before the discount.
4. Apply the 10% discount to find the final amount Jean paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours per week.
- The makeup artist works 6 hours each day.
- She works 4 days a week.
- Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours for the entire movie.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- The number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree is \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) sections.
- Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \times 400 = 8000 \) pounds.

Next, determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate:
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \) pounds.

Finally, subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \) pounds.

Thus, the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies:**
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the amount needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:**
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
S = 6

"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, we first calculate the total number of stars contributed by the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows.

- There are three rows of 8 stars each: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
- There are two rows of 6 stars each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.

Adding these together gives the total number of stars from the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtracting the stars from the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each 5-star row contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy loses:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Sandy} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all these expenses:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. 

Let's denote the number of pencils in each of Jam's boxes as \( x \). Therefore, the equation for the total number of pencils Jam has is:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to determine the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all 72 pencils, given that each box holds 8 pencils. We can calculate this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.
   - Salary of each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers × Salary of each junior programmer.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 × $2000 = $80,000.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, therefore, has \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160.

2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so:
   - Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so:
   - Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weights of all the animals and the container:
- Pink frog = 50 pounds
- Blue beetle = 50 pounds
- Green toad = 50 pounds
- Yellow snake = 60 pounds
- Red bird = 30 pounds
- Container = 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, they sold \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the net sales for Sunday are \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

Now, let's add up the total sales over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total sales = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Mary has 30 sheep.
2. Half of the sheep (30 / 2 = 15) give 1 kg of milk each day.
3. The other half (also 15 sheep) give 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, calculate the total milk from each group:
- Milk from the first group (15 sheep): 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg
- Milk from the second group (15 sheep): 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Add the milk from both groups to get the total daily milk collection:
- Total milk: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land equals 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. Then, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

   5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The total cost for the meat and cheese is:
   \[
   35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Tyson would spend a total of $50 on the meat and cheese.

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis at Allan's house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, Allan buys more cannolis and corns:
3. He buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he buys is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, let's find the new total number of corns:
5. The new total number of corns is \(80 + 60 = 140\).

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis:
6. The combined total is \(140 + 100 = 240\).

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, let's break down the information provided:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps to and from school.
3. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

First, calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
- Steps to and from school: 5,000
- Steps with his friend: 1,000
- Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total number of steps he had taken by then is:
- Total steps before the jog: 6,000
- Steps left to reach 10,000: 2,000
- Total steps taken by the end of the jog: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
- Total steps taken by the end of the jog: 8,000
- Total steps before the jog: 6,000
- Steps during the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there, so he needs to leave 10 minutes before his 60-minute deadline:
60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, we can calculate how many minutes early he will be:
50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month for simplicity)

   Total payment for one employee in May:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Total payment for all employees in May:
   \[
   2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 96000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \text{ employees}
   \]

   Total payment for one employee in June:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Total payment for all employees in June:
   \[
   2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 72000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   \[
   96000 \text{ dollars (May)} + 72000 \text{ dollars (June)} = 168000 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Cost of taffy:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.50 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: \( 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the mixed bag of seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of the magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is \( 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \) dollar.

4. **Total cost of all purchases:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = \( 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \) dollars.

5. **Money left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - She spent $7.
   - Money left = \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

"To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and add the cost of the finale firework.

1. Calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:
   - The first pack costs $400.
   - The second pack costs twice as much as the first pack, which is \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. Add the costs of the two packs:
   - Total cost before discount: \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs:
   - Discount amount: \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
   - Cost after discount: \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.

4. Add the cost of the finale firework:
   - Total cost: \(960 + 150 = 1110\) dollars.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 cookies by 30 days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Next, we need to convert the total number of cookies into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. 

First, we know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles will explode. 

1% of 50,000 candles:
\[ 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \text{ candles will explode} \]

Next, we are told that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 

5% of 500 exploding candles:
\[ 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \text{ candles will both explode and smell like wet dog} \]

Therefore, the number of candles that will both explode and smell like wet dog is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of camels.
2. Let \( D \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
- The total number of humps is 304.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \)
   - Total distance for the next 2 days: 240 km

3. **Next 1 day**: He wasn't traveling at all.
   - Total distance for this day: 0 km

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, summing up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \)

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we need to work through the relationships between the sizes of the lockers step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker.
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we calculate the difference between the comb's elevation and Oliver's current elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over after buying the ticket. This means he had a total of $150 from selling his cards.
2. Each card is sold for $1.5.
3. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he made by the price per card:
   \[
   \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would only have one hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for one hotdog) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26 / 2 = 13 guests.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon before the increase can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost for 20 balloons}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

Next, we need to find the new cost per balloon after the price increase. The problem states that the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price. This can be done by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

"To find the amount of change Theo received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

1. The cost of the pen is $2.
2. The cost of the piece of paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is \(3 \times 2 = 6\). Therefore, the cost of the paper is \(6 - 1 = 5\).

Next, we add the cost of the pen and the paper to find the total cost:
\[2 + 5 = 7\]

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
\[10 - 7 = 3\]

The amount of change Theo received is $3.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of pencils at each stage.

1. **Initial number of pencils:**
   - There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total initial pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils used after two months:**
   - 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.
   - Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

3. **Pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have five cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is:
6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is:
2 remoras * 0.5 feet/remora = 1 foot

The shark's total length is 10 feet. The percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents is calculated as follows:
(Combined length of remoras / Shark's body length) * 100%
(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the grade level. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. The 20 students who do not have desktop computers represent this one-fourth.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( x \). According to the problem, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer, so we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

First, let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.
4. Together, they found 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + \frac{B}{2} + \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) = 43
   \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[
B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
B + B + 7 = 43
\]

\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
2B = 36
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David and Lily found:

David found \( \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) insects.

Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein to yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of cows on the farm**: 30 cows.
2. **Number of sheep on the farm**: The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. The zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) sheep.
3. **Number of cows at the zoo**: The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. The farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cows.
4. **Number of sheep at the zoo**: 20 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo:

- **Total animals on the farm**: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- **Total animals at the zoo**: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Finally, the combined total number of animals is:
40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120 animals.

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to determine the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

1. From January 1 to July 19:
   - January has 31 days.
   - February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
   - March has 31 days.
   - April has 30 days.
   - May has 31 days.
   - June has 30 days.
   - July 1 to July 19 is 19 days.

Adding these together: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

2. Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. Since 1 lb of body weight is approximately equivalent to 3500 calories, the total calorie deficit required is:
   30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories.

3. To find the daily calorie deficit, divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

2. Calculate the additional daily electric consumption due to the new device.
3. Determine the total daily electric consumption after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.
5. Determine the cost of the weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.
6. Find the difference in the weekly electric bill.

**Step 1: Current daily electric consumption**
Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.

**Step 2: Additional daily electric consumption due to the new device**
The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour.

**Step 3: Total daily electric consumption after adding the new device**
Total daily consumption = Current daily consumption + Additional consumption
Total daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour
Total daily consumption = 14 kilowatts per hour

**Step 4: Weekly electric consumption**
- Weekly consumption before adding the new device:
  Weekly consumption before = 12 kilowatts per hour * 24 hours/day * 7 days/week
  Weekly consumption before = 2016 kilowatts

- Weekly consumption after adding the new device:
  Weekly consumption after = 14 kilowatts per hour * 24 hours/day * 7 days/week
  Weekly consumption after = 2352 kilowatts

**Step 5: Cost of the weekly electric consumption**
- Cost before adding the new device:
  Cost before = 2016 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt
  Cost before = $3024

- Cost after adding the new device:
  Cost after = 2352 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt
  Cost after = $3528

**Step 6: Difference in the weekly electric bill**
Difference = Cost after - Cost before

"To calculate how much you end up paying, first, determine the total amount including the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill, which is $10. Therefore, the total amount including the tip is $50 + $10 = $60. Since you are splitting the check evenly but paying the entire tip, you pay half of the original bill plus the full tip. This means you pay $25 (half of $50) + $10 (the tip) = $35.

"First, we determine how much each boy initially received when $18 was shared among 3 boys. Each boy received:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy added $5 to his share on the first day, so his total became:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10, so his total then became:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8, so his total after spending became:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. Therefore, his final amount is:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   - April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the savings equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
   - He saves twice as much each day in the second half, so he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the month:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)
   - Total monthly savings: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \)

5. **Set the total monthly savings equal to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \)

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half:**
   - Amount saved each day in the second half: \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April to meet his target.

"To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we first calculate the total earnings for each of them based on the number of tasks completed and the payment per task.

1. Calculate Jairus's total earnings:
   - Jairus earns $0.8 per task.
   - He completed 20 tasks.
   - Total earnings for Jairus = $0.8 * 20 = $16.

2. Calculate Jenny's total earnings:
   - Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
   - She completed 20 tasks.
   - Total earnings for Jenny = $0.5 * 20 = $10.

3. Determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny:
   - Difference = Jairus's total earnings - Jenny's total earnings
   - Difference = $16 - $10 = $6.

Thus, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. Each person calls 3 others, and this process repeats in each round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount:

- Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50 per notebook = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens * $0.25 per pen = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00 per calculator = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00 per geometry set = $10.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, so we calculate the discount amount:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know there are 7 buttons with two holes each. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is:
\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is:
\[ 21 \text{ buttons} - 7 \text{ buttons} = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with four holes:
\[ 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Finally, we add the number of holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs. 

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles needed:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The set temperature is 450 degrees, and the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

The percentage increase is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to set the oven to a temperature that, when increased by 4%, will result in 520 degrees.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. We can set up the equation:
\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees.

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount. 

The original price for 2 boxes is:
2 boxes * $100.00/box = $200.00

The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is:
10% of $200.00 = 0.10 * $200.00 = $20.00

The total cost after the discount is:
$200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Next, we need to determine the total number of contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

Since each box lasts 45 days, 2 boxes will last:
2 * 45 days = 90 days

Now, to find the cost per contact:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00/contact

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the cost per pair is:
$1.00/contact * 2 contacts/pair = $2.00/pair

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Determine the total amount of protein John consumes in one week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so the amount of protein he gets per day is 6 grams.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week (7 days):
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle before needing replacement.
3. Calculate how many months the tires will last.
4. Convert the number of months into years.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations the tires can handle.**

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 3: Calculate how many months the tires will last.**

To find out how many months the tires will last:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

**Step 4: Convert the number of months into years.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:

"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the amounts of meat eaten by each player who consumed meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed in the first three days and the number of cars towed in the remaining four days.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in these three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. Thus, the number of cars towed each day for these four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of cars towed in these four days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. Adding the totals from both parts gives us the total number of cars towed in the week:
   \[
   30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is 54.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 48 inches.

Adam's current height is 40 inches, and he needs to be 48 inches tall to ride the roller coaster. The difference in height is:

48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the height difference by his annual growth rate:

8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sales amount.**
James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
\[ \text{Total sales} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost to acquire the cars.**
The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost to acquire one car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total cost to acquire 10 cars} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total sales} - \text{Total cost to acquire} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**
James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{James's commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Next, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we calculate Tommy's catch as:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first calculate the maximum total cost allowed for the classes to remain under the $10 per class limit.

The total cost for 10 classes at $10 per class is:
\[ 10 \text{ classes} \times \$10/\text{class} = \$100 \]

However, Manny's classes cost $60 in total. To find out how many classes he can miss, we need to determine the cost per class if he misses some classes. Let \( x \) be the number of classes he attends. The cost per class he attends is:
\[ \frac{\$60}{x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{\$60}{x} \leq \$10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10x \]
\[ x \geq 6 \]

This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at or below $10. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost of suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost of dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He buys 10 suits, so he buys 10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost of dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. **Initial cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rental**: $5,000
3. **Monthly fuel cost**: Twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost = Hanger rental + Fuel cost
- Monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = Monthly maintenance cost * 12
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost:
- Total cost = Initial cost + Annual maintenance cost
- Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15

3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.

So, we add these to the counts:
- **Good Days**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.
- **Neutral Days**: 10 (initial) + 1 (next three days) = 11 days.
- **Bad Days**: 8 (initial) + 0 (next three days) = 8 days.

Now, we need to determine how many good days are left in the month. Since the month has 30 days and we have already accounted for 33 days (30 initial + 3 next days), we need to consider only the first 30 days for the final count.

Thus, the number of good days in the first 30 days is 12.

However, since the next three days include 2 good days, we need to adjust the count for the remaining days in the month:
- **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 (initial) + 2 (next three days) = 14 days.

Since the month has 30 days, and we have already accounted for 33 days, we need to consider only the first 30 days for the final count. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To determine Skyler's investment, we need to follow the steps of how the total amount of $1200 was distributed among Dylan, Frances, and Skyler.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

2. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

4. **Skyler's Investment:**
   The remaining amount after both Dylan's and Frances's investments is:
   \[
   720 - 480 = 240
   \]

Thus, Skyler's investment is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how much Karen earns in one day. If she works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns 120 dollars in two days.

"To determine by how much the group exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we first calculate the total weight of the 9 adults (including Jack) and then compare it to the maximum load capacity.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults:
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

2. Compare the total weight to the maximum load capacity of the elevator:
   - Maximum load capacity = 700 kg.
   - Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load capacity = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The group exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To find out how many cookies they have in total, let's start by determining how many cookies each person has based on the information given.

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, we add up all the cookies:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as \( L \).

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. Therefore, the final length of the dress is \( 1.5L + 20 \) cm.

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

   - Time in turtle mode = 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn, he would take half of 40 minutes.
   - Time in rabbit mode = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
   - Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on his homework and subtract that from the time he has before dinner.

First, let's add up the time John will spend on his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Next, we need to convert the time before dinner into minutes:
- John has 3 hours before dinner.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap:
- Time before dinner: 180 minutes
- Total homework time: 80 minutes

Time available for napping = 180 - 80 = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

This means the cost for the four candies is:

$3.20 (total cost) - $2.00 (cost of lollipops) = $1.20

The cost of one candy is:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00

The cost for 10 candies is:

10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

The total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

$4.00 (cost of lollipops) + $3.00 (cost of candies) = $7.00

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each of them saves over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together gives:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
Heartworm check = 0.60 * \( T \)

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\( T = 40 + 0.60T \)

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
0.40T = 40
\( T = 40 / 0.40 \)
\( T = 100 \)

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
$125 - $100 = $25

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. Since Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the time:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money per hour. We know that they raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. 

1. Calculate the hourly rate:
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

2. Determine the total amount of money still needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Hourly rate}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

4. Add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours needed to find the total hours required:

"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we first need to determine the cost of each type of item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final total:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
$45.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00 under the deal ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we need to calculate the cost and the number of scoops she can get.

1. Each scoop costs $1.50.
2. For every 2 scoops bought, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

First, calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
- Cost for 2 scoops = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
- Number of sets of 3 scoops she can buy with $6.00 = $6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, the total number of scoops she can get is:
- Total scoops = 2 sets * 3 scoops/set = 6 scoops

Therefore, Erin can buy 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books each person has.

1. We know that Clara has 20 books.
2. Clara has two times as many books as Steven. Therefore, if we let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has, we can write the equation:
   \[
   2S = 20
   \]
   Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

"To solve this problem, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers + 60 small buttons = 63 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from the first trade.
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from the second trade.
   - Lorraine has 63 small buttons from the third trade.
   - Total large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.
   - Total small buttons = 63 small buttons.

6. **Final Count of Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons.

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To determine how many cases of shingles the third house will need, we can set up the problem with the following variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
- The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it will need \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so it will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 50 \]

Since the third house needs \( 2x \) cases, we calculate:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles per hour} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long they drove. The total travel time was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance they drove is calculated by multiplying the driving time by their driving speed:

\[ \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles per hour} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate the points each of them earns and then find the difference.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Ava's points:
- Enemies: \( E + 8 \) (since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma)
- Berries: \( B + 3 \) (since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma)
- Timer: \( T - 4 \) (since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma)

Emma's points:
- Enemies: \( E \)
- Berries: \( B \)
- Timer: \( T \)

Now, let's calculate the total points for each:

Emma's total score:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

Ava's total score:
\[ 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

The difference in their scores:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 - 10E - 5B - 30T \]
\[ -25 \]

"To determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the special days.

1. **Usual Days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - This happens for 5 days.
   - Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Special Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual number of rides (3 times) is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day.
   - This happens for 2 days.
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total Rides in a Week:**
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2(4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used per week.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, which is a round trip of:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (one way)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles per day} \]

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total distance per week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used per week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the amount of fuel used per week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used per week.**

The price of gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of the fuel used per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, which includes the quarters and a portion of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money from the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- Total from quarters = 140 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $35.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money from the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has 10 twenties.
- Total from twenties = 10 twenties * $20/twenty = $200.

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties:
- Amount spent from twenties = 3/5 * $200 = $120.

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = $35 (from quarters) + $120 (from twenties) = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is $155.

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature during the night. 

1. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
2. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day.

So, the temperature during the night is:
\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees.

The required temperature increase is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of employees after three months.**

- Initial number of employees: 200
- Number of new employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Total number of new employees hired in 3 months = 20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

Total number of employees after 3 months = Initial number of employees + Total number of new employees hired

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

   \[
   16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. Add the amounts of tea consumed by both groups of students:
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
   \]

4. Add the remaining tea to the total amount consumed to find the initial amount of tea:
   \[
   38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower Rose initially picks.
2. Subtract the petals from the flowers that were dropped.
3. Sum the remaining petals.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:**

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
  \[
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
  \[
  4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
  \[
  5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
  \]

- For the 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of petals before any flowers are dropped:**

\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the petals from the flowers that were dropped:**

- 1 flower with 5 petals:
  \[
  5 \text{ petals}
  \]

- 1 flower with 6 petals:
  \[
  6 \text{ petals}
  \]

- 1 flower with 4 petals:
  \[
  4 \text{ petals}
  \]

- 1 flower with 7 petals:
  \[
  7 \text{ petals}
  \]

Total petals from the dropped flowers:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of petals remaining in the vase:**

\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

Thus, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Since there are two worse friends: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \)

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \)

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces. Let:
- \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest,
- \( f \) be the amount of fragrance,
- \( s \) be the amount of salt,
- \( g \) be the amount of sugar,
- \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( z = f \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance),
2. \( s = g \) (the same amount of salt as sugar),
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt),
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest).

We also know the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

Finally, find \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

Thus, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the hours walked on both days.
3. Convert the total hours into minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day:
\[ \text{Hours on the second day} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the hours walked on both days:
\[ \text{Total hours} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total hours into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the school parking lot.
2. **First Break Count**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars at this point is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ cars}
   \]
3. **Lunch Break**: When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he noticed that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ cars}
   \]
4. **Remaining Cars**: The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:

   - Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is \( 30 \times 5 = 150 \) tasks.

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, John's daily earnings are \( 150 \times 1.20 = 180 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, his weekly earnings are \( 180 \times 7 = 1260 \) dollars.

So, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{2v}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D = 54v \) into the equation:
     \[
     T = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance.

   - Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
   - Adam slices 3 large apples.
   - Total slices from large apples = 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices.

2. Calculate the number of slices from the small apples:
   - Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
   - Adam slices 5 small apples.
   - Total slices from small apples = 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices.

3. Calculate the total number of slices from all the apples:
   - Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples = 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices.

4. Determine how many slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices:
   - Slices left = total slices - slices eaten = 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production with the current number of cows.

The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total milk production per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required to produce the extra 10 liters is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Next, we sum the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

Total cost = Cost of car + Cost of phone
Total cost = $10000 + $800
Total cost = $10800

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

Total money Gabriel has = Money from working + Money from brother
Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200
Total money Gabriel has = $5200

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Money needed = $10800 - $5200
Money needed = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

The intermission takes 10 minutes, so the time available for performances and transitions is:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires:
2 minutes to get on stage
6 minutes to perform
2 minutes to exit the stage
This totals to 10 minutes per group.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal),
- \( t \) is the time in years (3 years).

First, calculate the annual interest rate as a decimal:
\[ r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \]

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

Finally, add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts without collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Thus, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Baskets:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Total cost for green baskets = 3 * $25 = $75.

2. **Cost of Red Baskets:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total cost for red baskets before discount = 3 * $18 = $54.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Total discount for red baskets = 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for red baskets after discount = $54 - $6 = $48.

3. **Total Cost:**

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. This is calculated as:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
   \]
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount. The total number of homes built in the first two years is:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes}
   \]
   Doubling this amount gives:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes}

"To determine how much money Isaias spent to buy the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost of the chickens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.**

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:
\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.**

Each chicken is sold for $50:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

**Step 3: Use the profit to find the cost of the chickens.**

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost of the chickens can be calculated by subtracting the profit from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Cost of the chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

Thus, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling her rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is willing to pay $2 per meter. So, the total amount Sarah will receive is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this money Sarah will spend on buying a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. If she buys a new rope of the same length (20 meters), the cost will be:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah received from selling her old rope to find out how much money she will have left over:

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, Sarah will have \$10 left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.
   - Cost of one pack of chicken = $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Total cost for 6 packs of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

5. **Total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
   - Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

6. **Money left in budget:**
   - Kelly’s budget = $65.
   - Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first account for the 15-minute encore in the final concert. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so the main part of the concert, excluding the encore, is:

65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert's main part is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the main part of the final concert by 2:

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
3. The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's.

First, let's determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid $6, and assuming he paid a fixed amount per mowing, we need to know how many times she mowed his lawn. However, the problem does not specify the rate per mowing, so we'll assume the $6 is for the total mowing done for Joe.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

- For Kamala's lawn, she mowed it \( 3J \) times.
- For Alba's lawn, she mowed it \( 5J \) times.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for mowing Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns. Since Joe paid $6, and we assume this is the total for all mowings for Joe, we need to find out how much she made from Kamala and Alba.

If Joe paid $6 for \( J \) mowings, then the rate per mowing is \( \frac{6}{J} \).

- For Kamala's lawn: \( 3J \times \frac{6}{J} = 18 \) dollars.
- For Alba's lawn: \( 5J \times \frac{6}{J} = 30 \) dollars.

Total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Tasha made a total of $80 last month, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup available and then subtract the number of bowls that will be used for dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill:
   - 4 adult bowls
   - 8 child bowls

2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult bowl of soup for dinner. This means:
   - 2 adult bowls will be used for dinner.

3. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the 2 adult bowls used for dinner are equivalent to:

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.

2. **Calculate the total pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.
   - Total pieces of bologna for red balloons = \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) pieces.

3. **Determine the remaining pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - Total pieces of bologna thrown = 58 pieces.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 40 pieces.
   - Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons = \( 58 - 40 = 18 \) pieces.

4. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Total pieces of bologna for yellow balloons = \( 3y \).
   - We know \( 3y = 18 \).

5. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - \( y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

"To find out how many pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has:
   \[
   \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, let's add up all the pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = 3 \text{ (cats)} + 9 \text{ (dogs)} + 7 \text{ (rabbits)} + 21 \text{ (fish)} + 7 \text{ (gerbils)} = 47

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of cups**: Lana has 27 cups.
2. **Cups used for cinnamon tea**: She uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea.
3. **Cups left for chamomile and mint tea**: 
   \[
   27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]
4. **Cups in each row**: She divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, so each row has:
   \[
   \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]
5. **Cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row**: Since the 12 remaining cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, and these 12 cups are distributed across 3 rows, the number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups per row}
   \]
6. **Cups of mint tea in each row**: Since each row has an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 2.

"First, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which has 10,000 gallons. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

First, substitute \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( Pa \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has:**
   - Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.
   - The teacher has 9 coupons.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles is \( 9 \times 100 = 900 \) bottles.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students:**
   - There are 29 pupils in the class.
   - Each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is \( 29 \times 2 = 58 \) bottles.

3. **Calculate the number of bottles of apple juice left for the teacher:**
   - Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles.
   - Therefore, the number of bottles left for the teacher is \( 900 - 58 = 842 \) bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing service, we need to consider the fixed visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Visit Fee**: $40
2. **Labor Cost**: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round 2.25 hours up to 3 hours.
   - Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total charge:
- Total charge = Visit Fee + Labor Cost + Parts Cost
- Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205

Therefore, the total amount Patty charged is $205.

"To determine how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount and then subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs he didn't like.

1. Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:
   \[
   10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150
   \]

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount:
   \[
   \$150 - \$60 = \$90
   \]

4. Calculate the amount James received from selling 5 CDs:
   \[
   5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200
   \]

5. Since James received more money from selling the CDs than he spent, he was not out any money. Instead, he made a profit. However, if we are strictly calculating how much he was out, it would be:
   \[
   \$90 - \$200 = -\$110
   \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and he actually made a profit, the amount he was out is $0.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of crop by its respective price and then sum the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.0

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.0

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.0

Now, we add the earnings from each type of crop:
$9.0 + $20.0 + $5.0 = $34.0

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.0 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time for the initial swim: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swim time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - Half of 2 miles per hour is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time for the remaining swim:**
   - Time for the remaining swim: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Initial swim time: 6 hours.
   - Rest time: 3 hours.
   - Remaining swim time: 8 hours.
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

1. **New York Times Commission:**
   - Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
   - Total commission from 6 copies = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal Commission:**
   - Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
   - Total commission from 10 copies = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15.00.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us two more equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the expressions for \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

First, we calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply by the thickness of the book:

\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Pages per inch} \times \text{Thickness in inches} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contains 2 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. 

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. 

To find the number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan originally has:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract these from the total number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Total admissions over 2 weeks (14 days) = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks**:
   - Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Total admissions
   - Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks**:
   - Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
   - Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So, we have:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day.
3. Use the information that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day. The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of Pokémon each person has caught with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon: \( A + S + W = 339 \).
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( A = S + 5 \).
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: \( S = 4W - 13 \).

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( W = 40 \) back into the equation \( S = 4W - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

"To find Wilfred's age, we start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool and then convert that volume into gallons. Finally, we will calculate the cost based on the rate provided.

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Substituting the given dimensions:
   \[
   V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to gallons:**
   The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} = 826 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

The cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank each day and then determine how much more is needed to fill the tank.

1. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \)
   - \( x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \)
   - \( x \approx 0.348 \) or 34.8%

3. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 34.8%.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - \( y \times 0.59049 = 0.348 \)
   - \( y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \)
   - \( y \approx 0.589 \) or 58.9%

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment.
2. Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.
3. Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.
4. Determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate the down payment amount.**
The down payment is 20% of the car's cost.
\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total amount spent so far:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the changes in the number of guests step by step.

1. Initially, the hotel was fully booked with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreased by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains 76.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   76 + 30 = 106

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the pricing pattern based on the given information. The first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6. 

We can see that the price per sandwich is consistent across the packages:
- For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
- For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.50. Therefore, the cost for 8 sandwiches would be:
- 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time it takes for Richard to move from the first bottle to the last bottle, dropping the candy in each bottle.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard places a bottle every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total time to move from the first bottle to the last bottle.**

Richard starts at the first bottle and moves to the next bottle, which takes 5 seconds. Since there are 8 bottles, he will move from one bottle to the next 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on until the 7th to the 8th).

The total time to move from the first bottle to the last bottle is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[ 35 \text{ seconds} \]

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and then figure out how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new income.

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total loans = 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   - Jim had a $25,000 a year job before college.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn:**
   - Total amount = Total loans + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = 3 * $25,000/year = $75,000/year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total amount:**
   - Total amount to earn = $300,000.
   - New income per year = $75,000.
   - Time to earn the total amount = $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric is:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric is:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
80 square feet (area of one piece) * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.
2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's letters: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's letters: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

Now, we sum the letters delivered over the three days:
- Monday: 425
- Tuesday: 102
- Wednesday: 209

Total letters delivered: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for this calculation.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ V = P (1 - r)^n \]
where:
- \( V \) is the value after \( n \) years,
- \( P \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( n = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ V = 20000 (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 (0.79)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ V = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ 9860.78 \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets. According to the problem:

1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet:
   \[
   S + H = 100
   \]

2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the 270 kilograms of meat that the Allosaurus ate is half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms of meat that was left after the T-Rex is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. This means that the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

Thus, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, the distance it covers is:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of days worked * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and the total miles she plans to hike daily.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes 125 miles twice a day, she will hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The additional miles she needs to hike are:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.
2. Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.
3. Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.
4. Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.**

- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Total toys produced by the first 4 workers:
  \[
  120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
  \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.**

- The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys:
  \[
  400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
  \]

- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift is 380 toys.

**Step 3: Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.**

- Total toys produced by the fifth worker:
  \[
  380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.**

- The fifth worker produced 180 toys in 10 hours:
  \[
  \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four**: 56 eggs.
2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: 30 eggs.
3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline**: 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.
4. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs**: Let's denote the number of eggs each painted by \( A \). Therefore, \( 2A = 26 \), so \( A = 13 \).

5. **Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah**:
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
   - Solving for \( S \), \( 2S = 18 \), so \( S = 9 \).
   - Therefore, Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

6. **How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold**:
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds.

1. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into groups of 8.
   - Number of boxes = 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

2. **Calculate the weight of the crayons:**
   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   - Total weight of crayons = 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

3. **Calculate the weight of the boxes:**
   - Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   - Total weight of boxes = 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

4. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   - Total weight = weight of crayons + weight of boxes = 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces

5. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   - There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   - Total weight in pounds = 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"First, we need to determine how much of the tree can be used for logs. Since John can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable tree:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each 4-foot log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so the total revenue from selling the planks is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 1 \text{ mile} \times 10 \text{ minutes per mile} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ \text{Amount saved so far} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60.

\[ \text{Amount needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28.

\[ \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the current number of marbles:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his current number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixed water is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[ \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[ 132 + T_2 \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
- Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
- \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make the scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know:
- It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
- \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
- \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops.

To find the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
- 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
- \( x \) potatoes make 18 scoops.

Using the proportion:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times x \]
\[ 54 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many bottles are currently produced.
3. Find the difference between the required number of bottles and the current production.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles needed
Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people:

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Masks per outing**: Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
2. **Outings per day**: He goes out three times a day.
3. **Masks per day**: 
   \[
   \text{Masks per day} = \text{Masks per outing} \times \text{Outings per day} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]
4. **Masks per 2 days**: 
   \[
   \text{Masks per 2 days} = \text{Masks per day} \times 2 = 6 \times 2 = 12

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the participants:
\[
5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}
\]

Finally, subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find out how many eggs are still hidden:
\[
36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs}
\]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes each have 200 apartments. Combined, they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ additional apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**

Adding the apartments from all three complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections per week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 3120 \text{ collections/week} \]

**Step 4: Compute the total earnings based on the payment rate.**

John gets paid $0.40 per collection:
\[ 3120 \text{ collections/week} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, John makes:
\[ 1248 \]

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. First, we need to find the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (as stated)
6. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree:
- 8-year-old tree: 1000 fruits (10-year-old) - 200 fruits = 800 fruits

Next, we sum up the fruits produced each year from year 5 to year 10:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced from year 5 to year 10:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits

Since the question asks for the total fruits produced during its 10 years of life, we need to consider the first 4 years as well. However, the problem does not specify the number of fruits produced in the first 4 years, so we assume they produce 0 fruits each year.

Thus, the total number of fruits produced over 10 years is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Amount Left in Ronnie's Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to their little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The amount left in Ronnie's money is \(2\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, calculate the amount of yellow paint:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is:
  \[
  \frac{12 \text{ pints}}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
  \]

Next, calculate the amount of paint used for the other three colors (red, white, and purple):
- The remaining half of the mural is 6 pints, which is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
- Therefore, the amount of paint for each of these colors is:
  \[
  \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
  \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the special size box and then find out the cost per pod.

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. Calculate how many pods you can get for $1:
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 is 10.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. So, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he makes the snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs**: Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.
2. **Rate of melting snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in one hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation**: 
   - Snowballs made in one hour: 20
   - Snowballs melted in one hour: 8
   - Net snowballs added per hour: 20 - 8 = 12

4. **Time to reach 60 snowballs**:
   - To find out how many hours it will take to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of accumulation.

  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Now, let's determine the initial number of bandages they started with. We know they ended with 78 bandages after using 91 and receiving 150 bandages.

Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.

The equation to find \( x \) is:
\[ x + 150 - 91 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 59 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, calculate her weekly earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, which totals:
  \( 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \)

- Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
  \( 45 \text{ hours/week} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 67.5 \text{ dollars/week} \)

Next, calculate her monthly earnings from her hourly wage:
- There are 4 weeks in April, so her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
  \( 67.5 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 270 \text{ dollars} \)

Now, add the attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week, and there are 4 weeks in April, so her total attendance bonus is:
  \( 10 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 40 \text{ dollars} \)

Finally, add her monthly earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus:
- Total earnings for April:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in a shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in a whale} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We do this by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
2. Each pack contains 5 pens, so the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

3. She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
   \]

4. Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

5. To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens:
   \[
   25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}

"First, let's calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of scotch} + \text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance is the total distance walked by all dogs divided by the number of dogs.

Given:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.
- The average distance walked by the 4 dogs is 3 miles.

First, calculate the total distance walked by all 4 dogs:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Average distance} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
- Base area = 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches
- Height = 15 inches

Volume of the jar = Base area * Height = 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

Packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
Total number of jelly beans = Effective volume / Volume per jelly bean = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900:
Difference = True number - Estimated number = 900 - 864 = 36

Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds needed for 80 meatballs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes:**
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - This can be written as: \( b = 3c - 2 \).

3. **Determine the total number of treats:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.
   - This can be written as: \( c + b = 10 \).

5. **Substitute the expression for \( b \) into the total treats equation:**
   - Substitute \( b = 3c - 2 \) into \( c + b = 10 \):
   - \( c + (3c - 2) = 10 \).

6. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - Combine like terms: \( 4c - 2 = 10 \).
   - Add 2 to both sides: \( 4c = 12 \).
   - Divide by 4: \( c = 3 \).

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. The total cost without the discount is $35 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) = $75. With a 20% discount, the cost is reduced by 20% of $75, which is $15. So, the discounted cost for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which totals 10 nails. At $3 per nail, the cost for the nail art is 10 nails * $3/nail = $30.

Adding the cost of the discounted manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art gives us the total cost: $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can start by setting up the relationships given in the problem with equations. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

1. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so if Kim has \( K \) paintings, Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Since Samantha has 27 paintings, we can write this as \( 27 = (K + 8) - 12 \).

Now, we solve for \( K \):
\[ 27 = K + 8 - 12 \]
\[ 27 = K - 4 \]
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to travel both the land and water portions of his journey.

1. **Total Distance**: 200 yards
2. **Distance on Land**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards
3. **Distance in Water**: Half of 200 yards = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time for each part of the journey:

- **Time on Land**: 
  \[
  \text{Time on Land} = \frac{\text{Distance on Land}}{\text{Speed on Land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time in Water**: 
  \[
  \text{Time in Water} = \frac{\text{Distance in Water}}{\text{Speed in Water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Land} + \text{Time in Water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is:

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made each day.
2. Determine the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made each day.
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed.**

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"To determine the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- The deal is buy one get one 50% off, so the first T-shirt is $8 and the second T-shirt is $8 * 50% = $4.
- The total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 40% = $16.
- The price after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know the following:
- The total number of animals is 20, so \( c + k = 20 \).
- Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 70, so \( 2c + 4k = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( k \):
\[ k = 20 - c \]

Next, substitute \( k \) in the second equation:
\[ 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( c \):
\[ 2c + 80 - 4c = 70 \]
\[ -2c + 80 = 70 \]
\[ -2c = -10 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
