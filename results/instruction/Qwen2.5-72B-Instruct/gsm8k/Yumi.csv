"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together.

- The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it needs 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Adding these together:

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts in total.

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   \( 150\% \) of $80,000 = \( 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \)

2. Add the increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house:
   \( 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \)

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs:
   \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

4. Subtract the total cost from the new value to find the profit:
   \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Therefore, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

He runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So for each session, he runs:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:

180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, the total meters James runs a week is:

540"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day for all her chickens.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Wendi has 20 chickens, so the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we need to account for the feed already given during the morning and afternoon meals. In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. The total feed given by the end of the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal, we subtract the total feed already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for Kylar's purchase, we need to consider the pricing structure: every first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

1. For every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 (for the first glass) + $3 (for the second glass) = $8.
2. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide this number by 2 to find out how many pairs he is buying: 16 / 2 = 8 pairs.
3. The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken for Carla to download the 200 GB file, including the time lost due to the Windows update.

1. First, calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, downloading 80 GB takes \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \) minutes.

2. Add the 20 minutes it takes for the Windows update to install:
   - Total time so far is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) minutes.

3. After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The full file is 200 GB, and at 2 GB/minute, it takes:
   - \( 200 \div 2 = 100 \) minutes to download the entire file.

4. Add the time to download the file after the update to the total time:
   - Total time is \( 60 + 100 = 160 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return time is 4 hours and 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours have already passed), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Journey:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

1. Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:
   Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Calculate the number of overtime hours:
   Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

3. Calculate the overtime pay rate:
   Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate * 1.2 = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

4. Calculate the total overtime pay:
   Overtime pay = Overtime hours * Overtime pay rate = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

5. Calculate the total earnings for the week:
   Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. First month: 60 downloads.
2. Second month: The number of downloads is three times the first month, so 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.
3. Third month: The number of downloads is reduced by 30% from the second month. A 30% reduction means the program retains 70% of the second month's downloads. So, 180 * 0.7 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads from all three months to get the total:

60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Income from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Income} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost:
\[ \text{Years to Recover Initial Cost} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} \]
\[ \text{Years to Recover Initial Cost} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.
2. Before the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners, which is after selling 2 more to the red house. So, before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.
3. Before the red house, she had 12 vacuum cleaners, which is after selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If 12 is two-thirds of the original amount (since she sold a third at the green house), then the original amount is 12 * (3/2) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Total number of students**: 20
2. **Percentage enrolled in contemporary dance**: 20%

First, calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, determine the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

3. **Percentage of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance**: 25%

Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, determine the number of students remaining after those enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that is enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire class enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over a 12-mile trail, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Solving for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, she has 1 hour left to complete the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum these amounts after accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:
- The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
- \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the amounts of water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Total water = 6 liters (from the orange drink) + 9 liters (from the pineapple drink) = 15 liters.

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old and that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. So, Raymond's current age is:

31 (Samantha's age) + 6 (years older than Samantha) = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago that was, we subtract the age he was when his son was born from his current age:

37 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when his son was born) = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we can break down the sales by the number of DVDs each group of customers bought:

- The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 customers * 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 3 customers * 0 DVDs/customer = 0 DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:

3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount. If \( P \) is the original price, then the price Kyle paid is 75% of \( P \) (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

The equation is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \):
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples:

- Chicken meal: $12
- 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
- 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total cost of these items:

Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:

Amount spent on pizza = Total paid - Total cost of other items
Amount spent on pizza = $50 - $33 = $17

Now, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she ordered:

Number of boxes of pizza = Amount spent on pizza / Cost per box
Number of boxes of pizza = $17 / $8.50 = 2

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will eat:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break down the trip into segments based on the information provided:

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means he stopped at the 45-mile mark (60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles).

The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance at which he made the second stop and the distance at which he made the first stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means that for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 units. Together, these units add up to 162, which is their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

The equation for their total age is:
7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get:
18x = 162

To find x, we divide both sides by 18:
x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Allen's current age:
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine what each friend guessed and then calculate the average of those guesses.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

80 (first guess) + 60 (second guess) + 100 (third guess) = 240

To find the average:

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 1 point more than the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both periods to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Total points scored by Mike: 9"

2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. After selling them, he uses the money to buy video games and has $5 left. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine if he sold all of them or not.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his lego sets:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games he bought:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, we add the $5 he has left to the cost of the video games to find out how much money he actually used:
$160 + $5 = $165

Since the total amount of money he made from selling the lego sets is $195 and he only used $165, we can determine if he sold all of his lego sets by comparing these two amounts. If he used less than he made, he must have some lego sets left.

$195 (total from selling lego sets) - $165 (total used) = $30

To find out how many lego sets this $30 represents, we divide by the price per lego set:
$30 / $15 per set = 2 lego sets

Therefore, John still has 2 lego sets.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

Let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

10 mph"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed and use it to find her running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.
   - Therefore, running speed = 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running speed is four times faster than walking speed.
   - Therefore, walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = 1/3 of 6 hours = 2 hours.
   - Time spent walking = 2/3 of 6 hours = 4 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed * time spent running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed * time spent walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. This means you can consume an additional:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We know that one serving of chips is 250 calories and the 300g bag has 5 servings. Therefore, each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since 250 calories are in 60g of chips, we can calculate how many grams of chips 200 calories would be:

(200 calories / 250 calories) * 60g = 48g

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies and the total revenue from selling the candles, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs \( \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
   - For 2 pounds, the total cost is \( 2 \times 10.00 = 20.00 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - The total revenue from 20 candles is \( 20 \times 2.00 = 40.00 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = \( 40.00 - 20.00 = 20.00 \) dollars.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she originally had from the total to find out how many were in the package.

Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes at work. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after this, so the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package is:

220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243 Post-it notes

Candice originally had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

243 (total after purchase) - 80 (original amount) = 163 Post-it notes

So, the package contained 163 Post-it notes.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on all ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly income by multiplying the daily income by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42

Step 3: Weekly income
To find the weekly income, we multiply the daily income by 7.
$42 per day * 7 days = $294

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he covers is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes him to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 pounds * (2 toys/pound) = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday:
\[ 6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360 \]

Revenue from car tires on Thursday:
\[ 4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160 \]

Total revenue on Thursday:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each.

Revenue from car tires on Friday:
\[ 12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480 \]

Total revenue on Friday:

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones including the interest, and then divide that total by the number of months in the installment plan.

1. First, calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest:
   \( 5 \text{ phones} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} = \$750 \)

2. Next, calculate the total interest for all the phones:
   \( 2\% \text{ interest per phone} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} \times 5 \text{ phones} = 0.02 \times \$150 \times 5 = \$15 \)

3. Add the total interest to the total cost of the phones to get the total amount to be paid:
   \( \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \)

4. Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months in the installment plan to find the monthly payment:
   \( \$765 \div 3 \text{ months} = \$255 \)

So, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

"To solve this problem, we first need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total earnings based on the number of pots sold.

1. Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00 per pot.
2. Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00 per pot.
3. Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00 per pot.

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

1. Earnings from marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00
2. Earnings from petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00
3. Earnings from begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the flowers to find the total:

Total earnings = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level, starting from the top and working our way down.

Given that the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, to find the average square footage, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

Average square footage = (128 + 64 + 32 + 16) / 4

Let's calculate the sum and then the average:

Sum = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240

Average = 240 / 4 = 60

The average square footage of a level is 60.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water:
   \[ \text{Water each girl received} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they both received is:
   \[ \text{Total water for two girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

3. The boy received 6 liters of water.

4. Now, calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy:
   \[ \text{Total water taken} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

5. Finally, subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left:
   \[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L \), we can find \( W \):

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive over these years, starting from the point where she has completed five years of service.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7,200

Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she is eligible for her first 10% salary increase.

3. **First Increase (Year 6)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $600 + ($600 * 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660
   - New Annual Salary: $660 * 12 = $7,920

4. **Second Increase (Year 7)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $660 + ($660 * 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726
   - New Annual Salary: $726 * 12 = $8,712

5. **Third Increase (Year 8)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $726 + ($726 * 10%) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
   - New Annual Salary: $798.60 * 12 = $9,583.20

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 10 \text{ lbs/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ lbs} \).

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( 10 \text{ lbs} / 2 = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \text{ lbs/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ lbs} \).

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad needed = \( 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \).

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time was \(38 + 2 = 40\) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means he can run the same distance in 90% of his original time.

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how long James slept. James slept 2/3 of the time Harry did. Since Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep time as follows:

James's sleep time = 2/3 * Harry's sleep time
James's sleep time = 2/3 * 9
James's sleep time = 6 hours

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep time from Harry's sleep time:

More hours Harry slept = Harry's sleep time - James's sleep time
More hours Harry slept = 9 - 6
More hours Harry slept = 3

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

Step 1: Since the volume of the tomatoes is reduced by half when cooked into sauce, the original volume of the tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of the tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 2: Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the original volume by the volume of one can:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Step 3: Each can contains three tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some of these cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 20 \]

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, the number of cars that did not drive through is 5.

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is the sum of the cars that drove through and the cars that did not drive through:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]

Subtract 25 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 times.

Now, let's calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times
- Third friend: 60 + 10 = 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Now, we add up all the times the doorbell was pressed:

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given rate of the fog's movement and the total distance it needs to cover.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes to cover 42 miles, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{42 \text{ miles} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box by subtracting the thickness of the walls from each dimension. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The inner dimensions will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Length * Width * Height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total time he spent watching TV each night and then solve for the unknown.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \(x\) 30-minute episodes, which is \(0.5x\) hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. So, we can set up the equation:

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5, so before dropping them, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.
2. The 115 cookies are 15 more than he intended to bake, so he intended to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.
3. He intended to bake twice as many as he did last year, so last year he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total area of the fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- Her fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Beatrice's roll-up is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- His fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Marcell's roll-up is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups.

Now, to find the average, we add the total area of both roll-ups and divide by 2 (since there are two people):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{48 + 42}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use that to find out how much water entered the boat.

First, we find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can set up a proportion to find out how far she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ x = \frac{1280 \text{ feet}}{16} \]
\[ x = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we know she rowed 80 feet, we can calculate how much water the boat took on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can set up another proportion to find out how much water entered the boat over 80 feet:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}} \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \]
\[ y = \frac{160 \text{ liters}}{10} \]
\[ y = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased price. Then, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100

2. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the lumber:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

4. **Determine the new selling price for each type of board:**
   - The price of lumber has increased by 50%.
   - New price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 * 1.50 = $15 each
   - New price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $16 * 1.50 = $24 each

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Total revenue for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150

6. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Total revenue for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120

7. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

8. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

Sasha's profit is $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many parts of the total mixture correspond to the sugar, based on the given ratio of 7:13 for sugar to water.

First, let's find the total number of parts in the ratio:
7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We need to find out how many of these 120 units are teaspoons of sugar.

Since the total mixture is divided into 20 parts, each part is:
120 units / 20 parts = 6 units per part

The number of parts that are sugar is 7, so the total amount of sugar used is:
7 parts * 6 units per part = 42 units

Since the units are teaspoons, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
   2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

2. The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30 vehicles.

3. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles:
   30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

4. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:
   20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \)
   - \( 40,000 = 1.30L \)
   - \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \)
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately)

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \)
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 40,000 + 16,000 \)
   - Adrien's new salary = \( 56,000 \)

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \)
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \)
   - Lylah's new salary = \( 43,076.92 \) (approximately)

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 \)
   - Total salary = \( 99,076.92 \)

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99,076.92.

2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. Julia had 12 spoons when setting the table.

We need to find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

The total number of spoons Julia had before setting the table can be calculated by adding the spoons from the package she bought and the spoons her husband bought, and then subtracting the spoons she used to sample the stew:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

"To find out how many sausages Dylan bought in all, we first need to determine the number of fish sausages he bought. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, and he bought 38 chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages as follows:

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Now, to find the total number of sausages, we add the number of chicken sausages to the number of fish sausages:

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

So, Dylan bought 82 sausages in all.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote:
- The number of queens as \( Q \).
- The number of baby bees as \( B \).
- The number of worker bees as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):

"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to first determine his total expenses and then subtract that from his total income.

Kim has 3 current clients and is confident about adding 5 more, making a total of 8 clients.

Each client requires:
- 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each
- 1 pack of cloths at $5 each

The cost for bleach per client is:
2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4

The cost for cloths per client is:
1 pack * $5/pack = $5

Total cost per client is:
$4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9

For 8 clients, the total cost is:
8 clients * $9/client = $72

Kim's total income is $92 per week.

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
$92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

Therefore, Kim's weekly profit is $20.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest: John has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare yields 100 pineapples. So, for one harvest, the total number of pineapples is:
   \( 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \)

2. Determine the number of harvests in a year: Since John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests per year is:
   \( 12 \text{ months/year} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \)

3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year: Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year:
   \( 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \)

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees at each stage:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 that many bees return. So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. 

To find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours, we need to determine how many bees had left and not returned by that point. Initially, 30 bees left, and 15 returned, so \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees had not returned. Then, 60 more bees left, so the total number of bees that had left and not returned is \( 15 + 60 = 75 \).

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 75 bees return to the hive.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received to this amount.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.

The total cost for 1 adult and 1 child ticket is:
$12 (adult ticket) + $10 (child ticket) = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
$22 (total cost of tickets) + $8 (change) = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance to home in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance to home in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home by dividing the distance by the speed.

Steve's time to get home:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time to get home:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time, which is how long the winner will be waiting, is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Now, we add up all the tires: 10 tires (bicycles) + 9 tires (tricycles) + 1 tire (unicycle) = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars: 500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change:
$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, Carl receives $4.00 in change.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to find the original number in the pack.

1. We start with the 5 fries left after the ants took one. Before the ants took the fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
2. The raccoon took two thirds of the fries before the ants, which means the 6 fries left were one third of what was there before the raccoon. So, before the raccoon, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries.
3. The three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so before the pigeons, there were 18 + (3 * 3) = 18 + 9 = 27 fries.
4. The seagull ate half the amount that Dave ate, which was 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.
5. Dave ate 14 fries, so before he ate any, there were 34 + 14 = 48 fries.

Therefore, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long. So, for these three days, he spends:
3 days * 3 hours/day = 9 hours

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. So, for these two days, he spends:
2 days * 2 hours/class * 2 classes/day = 8 hours

Adding the hours from all five days, we get the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TTh) = 17 hours/week

Now, to find out how many hours he spends in class over the 16-week semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

So, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes.

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to calculate the total length for each type of baked good and then sum these lengths. We will convert all measurements to feet for consistency.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.
   - Convert inches to feet: \( 1200 \div 12 = 100 \) feet.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - There are 120 croissants.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.
   - Convert inches to feet: \( 720 \div 12 = 60 \) feet.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - There are 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes in feet: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Now, sum the total lengths of all the baked goods:
- Total length in feet: \( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly banana requirement for all the apes combined and then multiply by 2.

1. Monthly requirement for monkeys: 200 bananas
2. Monthly requirement for gorillas: 400 bananas
3. Monthly requirement for baboons: 100 bananas

Total monthly requirement = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the total monthly requirement by 2:

700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first need to calculate the total distance each person runs.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).

\[ \text{Blake's total distance} = 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there and 40 yards back).

\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 1 \times 200 + 34 \times 80 \]
\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

**Difference in Distance:**
To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance.

\[ \text{Difference} = 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

"To find the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we first need to determine the depth of the water on Tuesday. On Monday, the depth was 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet.

So, the depth on Tuesday is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, we calculate two-thirds of 24 feet:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the original price of the bag of marbles: $20.
2. Determine the number of 2-month periods in 36 months: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) periods.
3. Calculate the price increase factor for each 2-month period. A 20% increase means the price is multiplied by \( 1 + 0.20 = 1.20 \) each period.
4. Apply the price increase factor for each of the 18 periods. The formula to calculate the final price after 18 periods is:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]
5. Calculate the final price:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

Using a calculator to find \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376
\]

Now, multiply this by the original price:
\[
\text{Final Price} = 20 \times 38.3376 = 766.752

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cars**: There are 5 red cars, and each costs $4.
   - Total cost of red cars = 5 * $4 = $20

2. **Action Figures**: There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5.
   - Total cost of action figures = 3 * $5 = $15

3. **Doll**: The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Cost of one action figure = $5
   - Cost of 3 action figures = 3 * $5 = $15
   - Therefore, the cost of the doll = $15

Now, we sum up the costs of all the toys:
- Total cost of all toys = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of doll
- Total cost of all toys = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is 60 * 90 seconds = 5400 seconds.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is 60 * 5 seconds = 300 seconds.

Now, let's add the total peeling time and the total cutting time to get the total prep time:
- Total prep time = 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds.

To convert the total prep time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
- Total prep time in minutes = 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

- Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade:
- Number of glasses per gallon: 20
- Price per glass: $0.50
- Revenue per gallon: 20 * $0.50 = $10

Now, we can determine the profit per gallon:
- Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

To find out how many gallons they sold to make a $25 profit:
- Number of gallons sold: Total profit / Profit per gallon = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. Since the total number of students who voted is 80, we calculate the winner's votes as follows:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes

Let's do the calculations:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80 = 60

Loser's votes = 80 - 60 = 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20.

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( C \).

Given:
- 200 pink calla lilies = 5 * \( C \)

We can solve for \( C \):
\[ 200 = 5C \]
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ C = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Now, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

Given:
- \( R = 4 * C \)

Substitute \( C \) with 40:
\[ R = 4 * 40 \]
\[ R = 160 \]

Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, we need to find out how old Jan was two years ago:
Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Now, we can find out how old Mark was two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2 * Jan's age two years ago) + 5
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2 * 28) + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19 years old.

Now we can find out how old Mark is now:
Mark's current age = Mark's age two years ago + 2
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21 years old.

Finally, we can find out how old Jean is:
Jean's age = Mark's current age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23 years old.

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time for each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Team A (Well-Rounded Team):**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for Team A is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Team B (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The total time for Team B is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the two teams is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%.

2. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) or 25%.

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We can do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{\text{Probability of rolling a number greater than 3}}{\text{Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row}} = \frac{50\%}{25\%} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we say it is 100% more likely (since 2 times more likely means 100% more likely).

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Total Straw Distributed:** 160 pieces
2. **Straw for Hamsters:** 10 cages * 5 pieces per hamster = 50 pieces
3. **Straw for Rabbits:** 20 pieces
4. **Straw for Rats:** Total straw - (Straw for Hamsters + Straw for Rabbits) = 160 - (50 + 20) = 90 pieces

Now, we know that the 90 pieces of straw are distributed among the rats, with each rat receiving 6 pieces of straw.

5. **Total Number of Rats:** 90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups:

6. **Number of Rats per Cage:** 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage

So, the number of rats in each cage is:

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, since the interest is applied monthly. The formula is:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the interest is applied.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 2\% = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Plugging in the values:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost of buying the bags is \( 20x \) dollars (since each bag costs $20).
The cost of transporting the bags is \( 2x \) dollars (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).

So, the total cost for the trader is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 30x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and we know the profit is $400:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 400 = 30x - 22x \]
\[ 400 = 8x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide that total by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: They spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since there are 3 friends, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:
$102 / 3 = $34

Each friend paid $34.

"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends collecting peaches and then multiply that by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 3 hours, there are:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John can collect 2 peaches a minute, so in 180 minutes, he collects:
180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily requirement.

Step 1: Total weekly requirement for ten ducks
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, so for ten ducks:
3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement
35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees Tom plants each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees.

Step 1: Net number of trees planted each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees he adds each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, and adding 8 trees each year for 10 years, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Final number of trees
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

The final number of trees Tom has left is:

"To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. According to the information provided, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. Therefore, the cost of one pen is:

Cost of one pen = Cost of one pencil + Cost of one eraser
Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of one pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * Cost of one pen
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times the initial number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. So, in the third month, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards she has:

Initial cards: 20
First month: 60
Second month: 40
Third month: 200

Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we add the earnings from both publishers to find out Mark's total weekly earnings:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance he rode in the first four weeks and the distance he rode in the following three weeks.

1. For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides \(125 \times 4 = 500\) kilometers.

2. For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides \(120 \times 3 = 360\) kilometers.

Adding the distances from both periods gives us the total distance:
- Total distance = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we can find the total weight of the bag by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, and half a dozen is 6 plates, the total cost for the plates is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of these plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups are equivalent to 240 cups (because one dozen equals 12), we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is:

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
2 pairs * $20/pair = $40

The total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs to save is:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (already saved) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
4 times * $5/time = $20

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings, she now has:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30

The remaining amount she needs to save is:
$70 (total cost) - $30 (current savings) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to save the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$40 / $4/lawn = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The number of eggs produced by the red chickens each day is \( 3R \) (since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day), and the number of eggs produced by the white chickens each day is \( 5W \) (since each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day).

The total number of eggs collected each day is the sum of the eggs from the red and white chickens:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length (L) = 6 miles
- Width (W) = 1.5 miles

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance Gary walks is 15 miles. To find out how long it takes him to walk this distance, we use the formula for time (T), which is:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour, we can calculate the time:

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of payments, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, including the 10% interest.

1. Calculate the total amount to be paid back:
   - Principal amount: $2000
   - Interest: 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200
   - Total amount to be paid back: $2000 + $200 = $2200

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Total payments over 12 months: $165 * 12 = $1980

3. Calculate the remaining balance after 12 months:
   - Total amount owed: $2200
   - Total amount paid: $1980
   - Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's current age.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is twice Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by the four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, let's calculate how many points Yuri scored:
- Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \).
- Yuri scored 10 more than this, so \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.

Next, let's calculate how many points Brianna scored:
- Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi, so \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \).
- Points scored by Jojo: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \).

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

   \[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]
3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]
4. Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:
   \[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

"To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the cost for each of them and then add those costs together.

For Carlos:
- The cost of renting a canoe is $30 per hour.
- Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- The total cost for Carlos is 30 * 3 = $90.

For Benji:
- The cost of renting a banana boat raft is $18 per hour.
- Benji uses the raft for 5 hours.
- The total cost for Benji is 18 * 5 = $90.

Now, we add the costs for Carlos and Benji together to get the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji

"First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is 33%.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen he made.

25 + 5 + 1 = 31

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pen pals Mike is still in contact with.
2. Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week.
3. Calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response.
4. Determine the total time he spends writing those pages.
5. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Mike was a pen pal with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is still in contact with:
5 - 2 = 3 people

Step 2: Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters he receives each week is:
3 people * 2 letters/person = 6 letters

Step 3: Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he needs to write in response is:
6 letters * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages

Step 4: Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing is:
30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

Step 5: To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Last night, Rick killed:
   - 10 wolves
   - 15 cougars

2. Today, Rick killed:
   - Three times as many wolves as cougars
   - Three fewer cougars than the previous night

From the information given, we can determine the number of cougars Rick killed today:
- Last night, he killed 15 cougars, so today he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Next, we can determine the number of wolves Rick killed today:
- He killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

Total animals killed:
- 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73 animals

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of Mitchel's 30 slides, we calculate:

30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

30 - 9 = 21

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

21 * 4 = 84

Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys the additional 40 cows. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so:

10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows

Now, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. Since there are 20 stalls, each stall will receive:

40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall

Now, each of the 10 original stalls will have the original 20 cows plus the 2 new cows:

20 cows/stall + 2 cows/stall = 22 cows/stall

Since the question asks for the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

22 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows

"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and dollar bill and then sum them up.

1. The value of the pennies: 100 pennies * $0.01/penny = $1.00
2. The value of the nickels: 40 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $2.00
3. The value of the dimes: 20 dimes * $0.10/dime = $2.00
4. The value of the dollar bills: 40 dollar bills * $1.00/dollar bill = $40.00

Now, we add up all the values:
$1.00 (pennies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $45.00

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is:

200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections

The total weight of the tree is:

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate, which is 30% of the total weight:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

From point 3, if Jamal has 44 apples, then he has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

From point 2, if Jamal has 48 bananas, then Andrea has \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:

- Andrea's fruits: \(52\) apples + \(24\) bananas = \(76\) fruits.
- Jamal's fruits: \(44\) apples + \(48\) bananas = \(92\) fruits.

The total number of fruits is \(76 + 92 = 168\).

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla will need, we can start by calculating the number of cups required for each day and then add them together.

First, we determine how many cups of flour are needed for 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour make a dozen (12) cookies, we can set up a proportion to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies:

\( \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}} \)

Solving for \( x \):

\( x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \)

\( x = \frac{72}{12} \)

\( x = 6 \text{ cups} \)

So, Carla needs 6 cups of flour for 36 cookies.

Next, we calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies:

\( \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}} \)

Solving for \( y \):

\( y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \)

\( y = \frac{60}{12} \)

\( y = 5 \text{ cups} \)

So, Carla needs 5 cups of flour for 30 cookies.

Now, we add the amounts of flour needed for both days:

\( 6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups} \)

Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup. 

The total number of pennies in the cup is 9,300. Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = 6,200 \text{ pennies} \]

Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars:

\[ 6,200 \div 100 = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is 62 dollars.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.
2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. To find this time, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to the initial 20 minutes:
   - 40% of 20 minutes = 0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes
   - Total time to heat up to 400 degrees = 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes
3. The total time to warm up the oil is the sum of the time to heat up to 300 degrees and the time to heat up to 400 degrees:
   - Total warming time = 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes
4. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil:
   - Cooking time = 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Since each of the 5-star rows contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and the result is a whole number, exactly 3 trucks are needed to transport all 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane and then use that speed to calculate the time it took to cover 480 miles.

1. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
2. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles/hour.
3. To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we use the formula for time, which is \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \).

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of medals given out.
   - Therefore, \( 39 = \frac{T}{10} \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to find \( T \):
   - \( T = 39 \times 10 = 390 \).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, so each child will get:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we first need to calculate the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

The total time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours. Converting this to minutes gives us:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Since Susan takes a half-hour break, the actual working time is:
180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval:
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"Let's break down the points each player has after the third round and then calculate the points after the fourth round.

After 3 rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, each player with over 20 points gets an extra point:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point and remains at 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all three players after the fourth round:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the pages. Each piece of paper, when folded, creates four pages: the front and back of the inside and outside of the fold. Therefore, each sheet of paper contributes to 4 pages in the final tabloid.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of sheets of paper required by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages each sheet contributes:

32 pages / 4 pages per sheet = 8 sheets

Thus, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year and then multiply that number by the price per book.

First, let's find out how many books she sold in the first year. We know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and this year she sold 45 books. Therefore, in the first year, she sold:

2 * 45 = 90 books

Now, let's calculate the total number of books sold over the three years. We know there are 50 unsold books out of the original 250, so the total number of books sold is:

250 - 50 = 200 books

We can now determine how many books were sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold:

200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 books

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:

65 * 20 = 1300

"To calculate Watson's earnings for April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus, given that the company performed well for the entire month.

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from the hourly wage:
   - Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, which totals 50 hours a week.
   - At $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from the hourly wage are 50 hours * $10/hour = $500.

2. Add the weekly bonus:
   - Since the company performed well, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week.

3. Calculate the total weekly earnings:
   - Total weekly earnings = $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800.

4. Determine the number of weeks in April:
   - April typically has 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks:
   \[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

2. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to calculate how many 4-week periods are required for her to lose 8 pounds. Since she loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set up the following proportion:
   \[ \text{Number of 4-week periods} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \]

4. Since each period is 4 weeks, the total number of weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - We know that Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - We are told that six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can find a common denominator, which is 2:

\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Next, we solve for \( D \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 and then dividing by 7:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Monthly salary of each junior programmer = $2000.
   - Total monthly salary for junior programmers = 40 \times $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   - Number of senior programmers = 60.
   - Monthly salary of each senior programmer = $2400.
   - Total monthly salary for senior programmers = 60 \times $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:**
   - Total monthly salary for all programmers = Total monthly salary for junior programmers + Total monthly salary for senior programmers.
   - Total monthly salary for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal.

1. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression for the number of people after the second stop:
   \[
   (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6
   \]

5. We are told that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.
5. After buying more, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
6. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge required:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. To find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40 percentage-points, we multiply the number of percentage-points by the time it takes to charge one percentage-point:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = $4 off

This shopping trip, they spent $43 before any discounts. They used their $4 in rewards, and the coupon they applied took twice the amount of the rewards off the price.

Coupon discount = 2 * $4 = $8 off

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied to this shopping trip:

Total discount = Rewards + Coupon discount = $4 + $8 = $12 off

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent to find out how much the customer paid:

Amount paid = $43 - $12 = $31

"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial total cost of the shares.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year's increase.
3. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year's decrease.

**Step 1: Initial total cost of the shares**
Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
Initial cost = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

**Step 2: Value after the first year's increase**
The stock price increases by 50%.
Increase = 50% of $8 = 0.50 * $8 = $4
New price per share after the first year = $8 + $4 = $12
Total value after the first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

**Step 3: Value after the second year's decrease**
The stock price decreases by 25%.
Decrease = 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New price per share after the second year = $12 - $3 = $9
Total value after the second year = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, therefore, has \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance between the third city and the first city:**
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip (first city to second city, second city to third city, and third city back to the first city) is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance for 3 trips in a day:**
   - Since the train makes 3 trips a day, the total distance traveled in one day is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

4. **Determine how many days the train can go before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can go before needing service, we divide the total service distance by the daily distance traveled: \(18,000 \div 900 = 20\) days.

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

- For 4 chihuahua beds: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) pounds
- For 3 collie beds: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) pounds

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing required:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

"To calculate the total time John spent on his trip, we need to break it down into the different segments and calculate the time for each.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Second Leg of the Trip:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both legs of the trip to get the total time:

Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of boys who were absent on Friday from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 boys

Next, we know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:

53 (total boys) - 4 (boys absent) = 49 boys

Therefore, 49 fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks be \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people who refused to wear masks, minus 5. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   4x - 5
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]

3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   3 \times (4x - 5)
   \]
   Substituting \( 4x - 5 = 7 \):
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

4. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence, plus those kicked out for other reasons. Let \( y \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total is given as 50:
   \[
   x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + y = 50
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 3 \) and \( 4x - 5 = 7 \):
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   31 + y = 50
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 50 - 31 = 19
   \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19.

"To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to determine her total points after scoring and then subtract the 14 points she just scored.

Sara has 8 points, and Erin now has three times more points than Sara. This means Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points more than Sara.

So, Erin's total points after scoring 14 points is Sara's points plus three times more:
8 (Sara's points) + 24 (three times more) = 32 points.

To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her total points:
32 (total points) - 14 (points scored) = 18 points.

Therefore, Erin had 18 points before scoring 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to consider the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords for the officers.

1. **Cost of Picture Frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of Etching:**
   - The etching adds an additional 20% to the cost of each frame.
   - The additional cost per frame is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - The total additional cost for etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, each costing $5.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of Cords for Officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers is 44 / 4 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add all these costs together to get the total cost:

- Total cost for picture frames: $880
- Total cost for etching: $176
- Total cost for pins: $10
- Total cost for cords: $132

Total cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"To find out how much Ethan saved by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate 20% of the market price of the wallpaper.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
0.20 * $400 = $80

This means Ethan saved $80 by making the wallpaper himself. To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the original market price:

$400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper was $320.

"Let's break down the sales over the weekend:

- On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
- On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
- On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs, but then 6 pairs were returned.

To find the total number of pairs sold by the end of the sale, we add the pairs sold each day and subtract the pairs returned:

- Total pairs sold: \(14 + 28 + 14 = 56\)
- Pairs returned: 6

So, the total number of pairs sold by the end of the sale is \(56 - 6 = 50\).

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Half of the sheep (30 / 2 = 15 sheep) give 1 kg of milk each.
2. The other half (also 15 sheep) give 2 kg of milk each.

Now, we calculate the total milk from each group:

- From the first group (15 sheep), the total milk is 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg.
- From the second group (15 sheep), the total milk is 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg.

Adding the milk from both groups together gives us the total amount of milk collected every day:

15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total amount of interest she will have to pay over the five months. The formula to calculate simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Rate (R) = 10% per year or 0.10 per year
- Time (T) = 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year

Let's calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 152.50 \]

So, the total interest Karan will pay is $152.50.

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount to be repaid:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50 \]

Since Karan has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.50 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( x \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ride ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs 2 * $2 = $4.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is 9 * $4 = $36.

Next, let's calculate the cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract this from the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix**: $10 per month.
2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**:
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the bundle discount is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
   - With a 20% discount, the savings on the bundle is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of the bundle is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services**:
   - Netflix: $10
   - Hulu and Disney Plus bundle: $16
   - Total: $10 + $16 = $26 per month.

4. **Savings**:
   - Cost of cable package: $60 per month.

"To find the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, we add up all the time spent:
Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100

Substituting the values we have:
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100

Now, we calculate the percentage:
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%.

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

Total bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total bugs = 90 + 30 + 48
Total bugs = 168

"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine the ages of Beth and Alice based on the information given.

1. Erica is 30 years old.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

Now, to find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:

42 - 30 = 12

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch:**
   - The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs:
     - Flour: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)
     - Milk: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

2. **Calculate the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk required:**
   - Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
     - Number of bags needed: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags}\)
   - Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
     - Number of bottles needed: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

3. **Determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:**
   - Number of bags of flour: 6
   - Number of bottles of milk: 2

"To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner before the reduction.
2. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner after the reduction.
3. Find the difference in daily energy usage to determine the daily savings.
4. Multiply the daily savings by 30 to find the total savings over 30 days.

Step 1: Daily energy usage before reduction
The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. If it is used for 8 hours a day, the daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Step 2: Daily energy usage after reduction
If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]
The new daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Step 3: Daily savings
The daily savings in energy usage is:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Step 4: Total savings over 30 days
To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
\[ 4500 \, \text{watt-hours} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]
The total savings over 30 days is:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

Therefore, the total energy saved in 30 days is 135 kilowatt-hours.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
\(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\) stripes

There are a total of 4 zebras, so to find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\(88 \div 4 = 22\)

The average number of stripes per zebra is 22.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate how many sandwiches he needs to make to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we calculate the cost for the meat and cheese:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and the cheese to find the total cost:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, let's account for the additional items Allan bought:

3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he bought is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, let's find the new total number of corns:

5. The new total number of corns is \(80 + 60 = 140\).

Finally, we add the new totals of corns and cannolis to find the combined total:

6. The combined total of corns and cannolis is \(140 + 100 = 240\).

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend, bringing his total to 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach 10,000, so he must have had 8,000 steps before the jog. Since he had 6,000 steps before the jog and 8,000 steps after the jog, he must have taken 2,000 steps during his jog.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we'll determine how long it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs to account for the 10 minutes it takes to get to the airport, so the total time he needs is:
30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, we can calculate how many minutes early he will be:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the payments for May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for May:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} \]
\[ = 40 \times 40 \times 4 \times 15 \]
\[ = 40 \times 1600 \]
\[ = \$64,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees in June:
\[ 40 \times \frac{3}{4} = 30 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in June: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

Total payment for June:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} \]
\[ = 30 \times 40 \times 4 \times 15 \]
\[ = 30 \times 1600 \]
\[ = \$48,000 \]

**Step 4: Add the payments for May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months.**

Total payment for May and June:
\[ \$64,000 + \$48,000 = \$112,000 \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost of Purchases:**
   - Total cost for taffy: $4.50
   - Total cost for seashells: $1.50
   - Total cost for magnets: $1.00
   - Total cost of all purchases: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - She spent $7.00.

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
- 20% of $1200 is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The total cost of the two packages after the discount is:
$1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. We know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them will explode. Out of the candles that are more dangerous (the 1% that will explode), 5% also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find out how many candles will explode:
1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 exploding candles will also smell like wet dog:
5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

1. Calculate the discount per blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is 30% of $20.
   - \( 30\% \times 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price per blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, which we'll call \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Joanne's apples} + \text{Sister's apples} = 500 \]
\[ (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]
\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (camels have 2 humps, dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( C \) and \( D \).

First, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. For the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day:
   \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \)

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled over the first four days:
   \( 30\% \times 800 \, \text{km} = 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \)

3. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is:

4. During the second week (7 days), he traveled 300 kilometers each day:
   \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \)

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\( 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \)

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can calculate the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

Zack's locker size = Peter's locker size * 4
Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find out the size of Timothy's locker. We are told that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can calculate Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

Timothy's locker size = Zack's locker size * 2
Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after a $4 savings, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after a $2 savings, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, which is a negative value in this context. Since the tattered jeans originally cost more, the correct interpretation is that the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less, not more.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is the number of cards he sells multiplied by the price per card, which is $1.5.

The money from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $150. We can set up the equation:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially preparing for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means he prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs and the other 18 guests to have one hotdog.
3. The total number of hotdogs prepared is therefore:
   - 18 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 36 hotdogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hotdog each = 18 hotdogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

4. However, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
5. The total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests, each having 2 hotdogs, is:
   - 40 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 80 hotdogs

6. The caterer only had 54 hotdogs, so the number of hotdogs short is:
   - 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs

7. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is missing 1 hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order was $132.00.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Money saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we subtract the total amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items:

$19 - $18 = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many gallons of gas are in one container.
2. Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
3. Convert the gallons to pints, knowing that 1 gallon equals 8 pints.

Step 1: Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Step 2: Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so the amount of gas she needed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 3: Convert 0.75 gallons to pints:
\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:** Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:** Since Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Bernadette's travel time} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the time difference needed for Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:** Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, she needs to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

4. **Calculate the total time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne:** Since Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes, he will arrive at the theater 4 minutes after he leaves his hotel. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater 9 minutes before Wayne leaves his hotel (4 minutes + 5 minutes).

5. **Calculate the time Bernadette should leave before Wayne:** Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before her arrival time. To arrive 9 minutes before Wayne leaves his hotel, she needs to leave:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- The area of the room is 360 square feet.
- The length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

Now, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads

Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 beads (red) + 40 beads (clear) = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads

Total beads Margareth bought = 60 beads (blue) + 80 beads (red) = 140 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the total number of beads Elizabeth bought from the total number of beads Margareth bought:

140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to follow the relationships between the lengths of the three movies.

First, we convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours long, we multiply 1.25 by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is $20 for the movie and one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra, making it $21 in total.

If you buy the movie ticket for $12 and the soda for $3, and you save $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the movie ticket, soda, and popcorn should be $2 less than $21, which is $19.

So, the equation for the total cost without the super ticket is:
\[ 12 + 3 + \text{popcorn price} = 19 \]

Solving for the popcorn price:
\[ 15 + \text{popcorn price} = 19 \]
\[ \text{popcorn price} = 19 - 15 \]
\[ \text{popcorn price} = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost for 20 balloons}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

After the price increase, the cost per balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. After that, we can divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are necessary.

1. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. **Hay**: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:
- Earnings from aluminum cans: 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents
- Earnings from plastic bottles: 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents

Now, let's add the earnings from both cans and bottles to get the total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Finally, to find the earnings for a four-week month, we multiply the total weekly earnings by 4:
- Monthly earnings: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

First, we determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we calculate 60% of 10 and add that to Frederick's total:

60% of 10 = 0.60 * 10 = 6

So, Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Next, we find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so we subtract 7 from Toni's total:

16 - 7 = 9

Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are the ones she gives to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 45\) cents.
- Convert 45 cents to dollars: \(45 \text{ cents} = 0.45 \text{ dollars}\).
- So, the total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.45 = 9\) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 50\) cents.
- Convert 50 cents to dollars: \(50 \text{ cents} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}\).
- So, the total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- The final cost for Kelly is \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, calculate how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Kelly paid 9 dollars.
- Becky paid 8 dollars.
- The difference is \(9 - 8 = 1\) dollar.

So, Kelly paid 1 dollar more than Becky.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since a pair is 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of any on Saturday:

200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

After getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday:

300 - 180 = 120 shoes

So, on Sunday, Frank will have 120 shoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of pencils at each step.

1. **Initial number of pencils:**
   - There are 30 students, and each started with 10 pencils.
   - Total pencils at the start = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils used after two months:**
   - 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.
   - Pencils remaining after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

3. **Pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, so in feet, each remora is:
6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

There are two remoras, so their combined length is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark is 10 feet long, so the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents is:
(Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100%
(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, then one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We know that the number of students without a desktop computer is 20, which represents one-fourth of the total student population.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( x \). Then, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80

"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day to break in his new shoes, we need to calculate the total time he has available over the three weeks and then divide the total required walking time by the number of walking days.

First, let's determine the total number of days Jason can walk in three weeks:
3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, the total number of walking days in three weeks is:
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, we know that it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the number of walking days:
240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day to break in his new shoes.

"To find out how many books each child got, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per book:

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now that we know Sarah bought 20 books, we can find out how many books each child received by dividing the total number of books by the number of children:

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of children
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

So, each child got 5 books.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, this sum counts the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids who are allergic to both:
15 - 3 = 12

This means that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to dairy or peanuts) = 20

So, 20 kids are not allergic to anything.

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of oats one horse consumes per day:
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse eats \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. Calculate the total amount of oats all four horses consume per day:
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(4 \text{ horses} \times 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. Calculate the total amount of oats needed for five days:
   - The total consumption for 5 days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. Determine how many 50-pound bags are needed to provide 200 pounds of oats:
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

"To find out how much each individual razor costs after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of razors without any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is \(2 \times 4.00 = 8.00\) dollars.

2. **Applying the buy one get one free offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for 1 pack when she buys 2 packs.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (the price of 1 pack).

3. **Applying the $2.00 coupon:**
   - The total cost after the coupon is \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

4. **Calculating the cost per razor:**
   - Heather gets 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she gets \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors in total.
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is \(\frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25\) dollars.

5. **Converting the cost per razor to cents:**
   - 0.25 dollars is equivalent to \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is 25 cents.

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on the next level
- 2 cheerleaders on the next level
- 1 cheerleader (the shortest) at the top

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th is 60 inches tall, the shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, will be at the top.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders, which is:
- 4 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches
- 3 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches
- 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches
- 1 cheerleader at 60 inches: \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches

Adding these together gives the total height in inches:
\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636\] inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636 \div 12 = 53\] feet

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by all three is 43, so we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we know David found 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

This means they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together. Now, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply 364 by 3/4:

364 * 3/4 = 364 * 0.75 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.

First, we find the width of the rug:
Width of rug = Width of chair + 5 feet
Width of rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of rug = 8 feet

Next, we calculate the length of the couch:
Length of couch = 2 * Width of rug + 2 feet
Length of couch = 2 * 8 feet + 2 feet
Length of couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of couch = 18 feet

The couch is 18 feet long.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs were strawberry flavored.
3. One pack was grape flavored, which cost $2.
4. One pack was green apple flavored, which cost half as much as the grape pack, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.
5. The total cost for all the packs was $7.

Let's denote the cost of one pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
\[ 2S = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 4 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then see how many of each he can buy with his $24.

First, let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks. So, the number of sticks per dollar is \( \frac{200 \text{ sticks}}{4 \text{ dollars}} = 50 \text{ sticks per dollar} \).
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks. So, the number of sticks per dollar is \( \frac{400 \text{ sticks}}{6 \text{ dollars}} \approx 66.67 \text{ sticks per dollar} \).

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides more sticks per dollar, it is the more cost-effective option. However, the question asks for the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24:
- Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4, so with $24, he can buy \( \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars per piece}} = 6 \text{ pieces} \).

Next, we calculate the total number of sticks he can get from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood:
- Each piece provides 200 sticks, so 6 pieces provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \).

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is 1200.

"To find out how much it will cost Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of legs that need snowshoes. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 4 legs/dog * 6 dogs = 24 legs.
2. Since snowshoes come in pairs and each dog will need a pair for each pair of legs (front and back), each dog will need 2 pairs of snowshoes. Therefore, for 6 dogs, the total number of pairs needed is 2 pairs/dog * 6 dogs = 12 pairs.
3. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day for her bus trips is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of a weekly bus pass is $20. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ 2.00 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has \(20 / 2 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Combined, the farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Rose bought 12 onions, which is 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought. So, we can find the number of onions Sophia bought by dividing the number of onions Rose bought by 4:

12 onions / 4 = 3 onions

Similarly, Rose bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times the number of potatoes Sophia bought. So, we can find the number of potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the number of potatoes Rose bought by 4:

4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato

Now, we can add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to find the total:

3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal.
2. Calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Divide the total number of calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.
- December 31st to January 1st is 1 day.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up: 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs.
- 1 pound = 3500 calories.
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.
- Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to lose / Number of days.
- Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 201 days ≈ 522.39 calories.

Since Andy can't burn a fraction of a calorie, we'll round to the nearest whole number.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Now that we know the total distance, we can calculate the amount of water she needs to drink. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can calculate the total amount of water as follows:

Total water needed = Total distance × Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, Julie has:

$500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, she spends 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

So, after buying CDs, Julie has:

$400 - $100 = $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

"To calculate Tara's profit, we need to determine her total cost and her total revenue, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) bags.
   - Each bag cost $4, so the total cost for the bags is \(40 \times 4 = 160\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   - Therefore, the profit is \(320 - 160 = 160\) dollars.

"To find out how much one monitor cost, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer cost $1,100.
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors:

Total cost of all items = Cost of computer + Cost of 2 monitors + Cost of printer
$2,400 = $1,100 + Cost of 2 monitors + $700

Now, we can solve for the cost of 2 monitors:

Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. Each boy brought back 60 shells. Since there are 10 boys, the total number of shells brought by the boys is:
   \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) shells.

3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means each girl brought:
   \( 60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 \) shells.

So, each girl brought 300 seashells.

"To find out how old Anne is, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now that we know Alyana is 6 years old, we can find out Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 years + 2 years
Anne's age = 8 years

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together. Let's break it down:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, we add the thickness of all four books:

31 mm (first book) + 50 mm (second book) + 45 mm (third book) + 62 mm (fourth book) = 188 mm

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to add up the number of vlogs she has already made over the first three weeks:

18 vlogs (first week) + 21 vlogs (second week) + 15 vlogs (third week) = 54 vlogs

Now, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal:

72 vlogs (monthly goal) - 54 vlogs (already made) = 18 vlogs

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"To calculate how much you ended up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.
2. Add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount.
3. Since the bill is split evenly, divide the total amount by 2 to find out your share.

Step 1: Calculate the tip
20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Step 2: Add the tip to the original bill
$50 + $10 = $60

Step 3: Divide the total amount by 2
$60 / 2 = $30

So, you ended up paying $30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total amount of money shared among the 3 boys is $18.
2. Each boy gets an equal share, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

Now, focusing on the eldest boy:

3. He adds $5 to his share, so he has $6 + $5 = $11.
4. The next day, he adds another $10, so he has $11 + $10 = $21.
5. He then spends $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.
6. Finally, he triples the amount he has left, so he has $13 * 3 = $39.

The eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April**: April has 30 days.
2. **Divide the month into two halves**: The first half of April has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.
3. **Set up the savings equation**: Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Then, in the second half of April, he saves \( 2x \) each day.
4. **Calculate the total savings for the month**:
   - Savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)
   - Total savings: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \)
5. **Set the total savings equal to the target**: \( 45x = 1125 \)
6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]
7. **Determine the amount saved each day in the second half**: Since \( x = 25 \), the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and then subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:
- The cost of the apples is 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
- The cost of the oranges is 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
- The cost of the peaches is 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total cost = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $20 - $13.00
Change = $7.00

So, Verna received $7.00 in change.

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we first calculate the total earnings for each of them based on the number of tasks they completed and the amount they get per task.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task. If he completed 20 tasks, his total earnings would be:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny earns $0.5 per task. If she completed 20 tasks, her total earnings would be:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day: Since Jeff's work is 3 miles away, he walks 3 miles to get there and 3 miles to get back. So, in one day, he walks a total of 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles.

2. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week: Since Jeff works 5 times a week, we multiply the distance he walks in one day by the number of days he works in a week. So, 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the steps Elise takes:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice means she writes:
   \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. She then writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is:
   \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters.

3. After this, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written 52 letters from the first step and 13 letters from the second step, totaling:
   \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.

4. Rewriting everything she has already written means she writes another 65 letters.

Adding all these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the phone tree. Each person calls 3 new people, and this process repeats for each subsequent round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are called.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are called.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, the total weight loss is:

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight loss to his final weight to find his initial weight:

70 pounds (final weight) + 30 pounds (total weight loss) = 100 pounds

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount, then apply the 10% discount to the total.

1. Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
2. Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
3. Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00
4. Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Now, we add up the costs to get the total before the discount:
Total before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total:
Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Total after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ray's swimming time for 1 mile in warm water:**
   - When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
   - When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.
   - Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this time gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - In cold water, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - In warm water, Ray swims 1 mile in 34 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

4. **Determine how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water:**
   - The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts: the holes from the buttons with two holes and the holes from the buttons with four holes.

1. First, we calculate the number of holes from the seven buttons that each have two holes:
   \( 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \)

2. Next, we determine how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
   \( 21 \text{ buttons} - 7 \text{ buttons} = 14 \text{ buttons} \)

3. Now, we calculate the number of holes from the 14 buttons that each have four holes:
   \( 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \)

4. Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \( \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \) pounds.
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun moves relative to the ground, not just relative to the pyramid. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid, and it does so for 10 hours. This means the sun will have moved 50 degrees upward from the tip of the pyramid.

Since the pyramid itself is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add this angle to the angle the sun has moved upward to find the total angle from the ground to the sun.

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun is:

32 degrees (angle of the pyramid) + 50 degrees (sun's movement) = 82 degrees

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming she read every night of the week, that's 7 nights. So, the total reading time in the first week is:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Now, we need to convert the reading time into pages. Since she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:

2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.3333 pages/minute

Now, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week:

105 minutes * 1.3333 pages/minute = 140 pages (rounded to the nearest whole number)

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages from both weeks to get the total number of pages read:

Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):

\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

"To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spends each day and then how many action figures he can buy with that amount.

First, let's find out how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we divide the total amount by the number of days:

$70 / 7 days = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures that cost $5 each. So, each day he buys:

$10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures

Since he does this for 4 days, the total number of wooden action figures he buys is:

2 wooden action figures/day * 4 days = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he spends $10 each day on plastic action figures that cost $2 each. So, each day he buys:

$10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures

Since he does this for 3 days, the total number of plastic action figures he buys is:

5 plastic action figures/day * 3 days = 15 plastic action figures

Now, we add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures:

8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops and the number of roses Ford can supply.

1. Calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per week:
   - First shop: 20 roses
   - Second shop: 15 roses
   - Third shop: 30 roses
   Total per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

2. Calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per month (assuming 4 weeks in a month):
   Total per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses

3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford can supply per month:
   Ford grows 40 roses per week, so in a month (4 weeks), he can supply:
   40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses

4. Determine the shortage:

"To find out how much money Katina will have left in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will withdraw over that period and then subtract it from her initial balance.

1. First, determine the total number of months in 2 years:
   2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months

2. Next, calculate the total amount withdrawn over 24 months:
   $100/month * 24 months = $2400

3. Finally, subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial balance:
   $3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

"To determine how much money Kate can make, we first need to calculate the total number of small crayon pieces she has and then how many crayon muffins she can make from them.

Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayons is:
3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one crayon muffin, the number of crayon muffins she can make is:
192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins

If she sells each crayon muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:
24 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.00

Therefore, Kate can make $36.00 from selling her crayon muffins.

"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom, we need to consider the cost of the new carpet, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   - The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.
   - Area = 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

2. **Calculate the cost of the new carpet:**
   - The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
   - Cost of new carpet = 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2,592.

3. **Calculate the cost of the padding:**
   - The padding costs $2 per square foot.
   - Cost of padding = 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432.

4. **Calculate the cost to remove the old carpet:**
   - The removal cost is $4 per square foot.
   - Cost of removal = 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864.

5. **Calculate the cost to install the new carpet:**
   - The installation cost is $34 per square foot.
   - Cost of installation = 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7,344.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide that number by 7 (the number of days).

Let's calculate the total number of birds first:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average:

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7
Average number of birds per day = 40

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. We need to add half of the starting value to the starting value itself:
   \( 20 + \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 \)
3. Next, we divide this result by 5:
   \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \)
4. Then, we need to find the starting value minus 12:
   \( 20 - 12 = 8 \)
5. Finally, we multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4:
   \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \)

The final value of the number train is 48.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

468 - 450 = 18 degrees

The percentage increase is calculated as:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

This means the oven is running 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a desired temperature of 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature that, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The relationship can be expressed as:

\( x + 0.04x = 520 \)

This simplifies to:

\( 1.04x = 520 \)

Solving for \( x \):

\( x = \frac{520}{1.04} \)

\( x = 500 \)

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve a temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, which means she bought 12 cups.
2. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

Now, let's consider what her friend brought:

3. Her friend brought 40 cups.
4. Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Next, we calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

5. Judy's total utensils: \(12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36\) utensils.
6. Her friend's total utensils: \(40 \text{ cups} + 44 \text{ dishes} = 84\) utensils.

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total number of utensils:

7. Total utensils brought by both: \(36 + 84 = 120\).

"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount. The original price for 2 boxes is $200.00. With a 10% discount, the total cost is reduced by $20.00 (10% of $200.00), making the total cost $180.00 for 2 boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes will contain 180 contacts.

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the number of contacts. So, $180.00 divided by 180 contacts equals $1.00 per contact.

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, and a pair consists of 2 contacts, we need to multiply the cost per contact by 2. Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is $1.00 * 2 = $2.00.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as follows:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total amount of protein John gets in one day.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week to get the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain twice as much protein:
200 grams / 100 grams * 3 grams of protein = 6 grams of protein

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

Step 3: To find the weekly intake, we multiply the daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
6 grams of protein/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein/week

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Next, we need to find out how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

120 pounds * 3/4 = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we calculate how many pounds each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds

And for Marissa:

90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

Finally, we add the total pounds of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo based on Jeremy's monthly driving distance and then determine how many months (and subsequently years) it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity.

1. First, we find out how many rotations the tires undergo for 400 miles:
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - For 400 miles, the number of rotations is \( \frac{400}{2} \times 725 = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \) rotations per month.

2. Next, we determine how many months it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity of 10,440,000 rotations:
   - \( \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations/month}} = 72 \) months.

3. Finally, we convert the number of months into years:
   - \( \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months/year}} = 6 \) years.

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, doubling the number of washes by using 1 pump per wash gives us:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per wash. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, so we divide the total cost by the number of washes:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since the question asks for the cost per pump in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

$0.10 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is:

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42 on the outfit, the amount of money Joe will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Funding: $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for additional months: 50% more than the initial monthly funding
   - Initial monthly funding: $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month
   - Additional monthly funding: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month
   - Total funding for additional months: 45 months * $30,000 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Initial 5 months: $100,000
   - Additional 45 months: $1,350,000
   - Total cost: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat.

"To find out how many students were in the school auditorium, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:
- There are 4 rows of seats.
- Each row has 18 seats.
- Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats.

Next, determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators:
- One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.
- Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats.

Now, calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats:
- Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Then, find out how many of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:
- One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
- Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats.

Finally, calculate the number of seats occupied by the students:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. So, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600 to get the speed in kb per hour:

20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72000 kb/hour

Next, we convert kb to Mb. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:

72000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck that week, we can break down the week into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
3 days * 10 cars/day = 30 cars

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than 10 each day, which means it pulled 6 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
4 days * 6 cars/day = 24 cars

Now, we add the totals from both parts of the week to get the total number of cars towed for the entire week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the height requirement is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and needs to reach 48 inches. The difference in height is:

48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Adam grows 2 inches a year, so to find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the total inches he needs to grow by the number of inches he grows per year:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how many men can stay upright on the wave, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate 25% of 100 riders:
   \[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

2. Determine the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who stay upright are women, we calculate 60% of 25:
   \[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

3. Calculate the number of men who can stay upright by subtracting the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. The key is to find the difference in their speeds, which is the rate at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed: 70 mph
Bob's speed: 55 mph

The difference in their speeds is:
70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is catching up to Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the rate of catch-up:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if he misses some classes. The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total.

If Manny misses a class, the cost per class for the attended classes will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). The number of classes he attends will then be \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class when he attends \( 10 - x \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine how much flour was in one bag. Since one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

\[ \text{Total flour in one bag} = 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Now, to find out how much flour was in three bags, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by 3:

\[ \text{Total flour in three bags} = 16 \text{ kg/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through both the soil and the clay.

First, we calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig at half the speed through clay, which is 4 feet per hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Finally, we add the time to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time:
- Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

The total amount she made in two months is:

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost (hanger rental + fuel expenses):
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 per month

For a year, the maintenance cost would be:
$15,000 * 12 months = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
   \[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of animal legs is 70:
   \[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( S \) and \( G \).

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Christina had 30 days of moods.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral.
- The next three days after these 24 days were good, neutral, and good.

First, let's determine the number of good days after the initial 24 days:
- The next three days included 2 good days and 1 neutral day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of good days in the month:
- Initial good days: 12
- Additional good days: 2

Since the month has 30 days, and we have accounted for 27 days (24 initial + 3 additional), we need to determine how many days are left in the month:
- Days left in the month: 30 - 27 = 3

Since the question asks how many good days were left in the month, and we have no information about the moods of the last 3 days, we can only conclude based on the information provided that the total number of good days in the month is 14. However, the question specifically asks for the number of good days left in the month, which, based on the given information, is 0 because the last 3 days are not specified as good.

"To find out how many cookies they have in total, let's start by figuring out how many cookies each person has based on the information given.

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:

\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing each half of his lawn in the different modes and then add those times together.

First, let's convert the time it takes to mow the entire lawn in each mode to the same unit, which is minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half of the lawn in each mode:
- In ""turtle"" mode, since it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half the lawn: \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it will take half of that time to mow half the lawn: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

Now, we add the times together to find the total time Chris spent mowing the lawn:
- Total time = Time in ""turtle"" mode + Time in ""rabbit"" mode
- Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
- Total time = 50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R \), we can find \( T \):

\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, we can find out how much the four candies cost by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:

$3.20 total cost - $2.00 cost of lollipops = $1.20 cost of four candies

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:

$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now that we know the cost of one lollipop and one candy, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

So, the final numerical answer is:

$7.00"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month and then calculate the total savings for both Rong and Neil over ten years.

1. Rong saves 20 coins every month.
2. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. This means Neil saves 20 coins + (2/5 * 20 coins) each month.

Let's calculate how many coins Neil saves each month:
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 28 \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for both over ten years (120 months):
- Rong's total savings: \( 20 \times 120 \)
- Neil's total savings: \( 28 \times 120 \)

Let's do the math:
\[ \text{Rong's total savings} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]
\[ \text{Neil's total savings} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

Finally, we add both totals to find the combined savings:
\[ \text{Total savings} = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
2. The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:

- The total cost for bananas: \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\)
- The total cost for apples: \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\)
- The total cost for oranges: \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\)

   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 \text{ (adults)} + 15 \text{ (babies)} = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs available:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so the number of regular chairs is:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs currently available:**
   - The total number of chairs available is the sum of the regular chairs and the high chairs:

"To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by all the students and then subtract this total from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty has, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points:
   - 30% of 50 points = 0.30 * 50 = 15 points
   - Betty's points = 50 + 15 = 65 points
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
   - Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   - Martha's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:
- Adam's points: 50
- Betty's points: 65

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, let's break down the information given:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Let's denote the amount of gravel Gary's truck can carry as \( G \).

The total capacity of the three trucks is the sum of the individual capacities:
\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):
\[ 8,800 + G = 11,600 \]

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

Given that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
3 dumplings/female + 1 dumpling = 4 dumplings

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Let's denote the speed of the turtle as \( S \) (in feet per second). Since the cat is 5 times faster, we can write the following equation:

\[ 5 \times S = 15 \text{ feet/second} \]

To find \( S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ S = \frac{15}{5} \text{ feet/second} \]
\[ S = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money. We know that they raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. We can calculate the hourly rate of fundraising as follows:

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money they need to reach their goal of $6300:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of additional hours needed to raise the remaining $4200 at the rate of $700 per hour:

\[ \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Hourly rate}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Hours already fundraised} + \text{Additional hours needed} = 3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal:
- Erin has $6.00.
- Each scoop costs $1.50.
- $6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops.

However, with the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

- Erin can buy 4 scoops with her $6.00.
- For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free, so for 4 scoops, she gets 2 free.

Therefore, Erin can get 4 scoops + 2 free scoops = 6 scoops in total.

   - Cost per pound of blueberries picked: $1.5
   - Total pounds picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound * Total pounds)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Total pounds: 30

   Total cost of buying = Cost per pound * Total pounds
   Total cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost of buying = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the new price of each computer after the 10% increase. The original planned price for each computer was $700.

The increase in price is 10% of $700, which can be calculated as:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are at her sides:

- Right foot: 300 taps per minute for 3 minutes (since her arms are raised for only 2 minutes, they are at her sides for the remaining 3 minutes).
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute for 3 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised:

- Right foot: 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes.
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of taps for each foot:

- Right foot total: (300 taps/minute * 3 minutes) + (200 taps/minute * 2 minutes)
- Left foot total: (250 taps/minute * 3 minutes) + (200 taps/minute * 2 minutes)

Let's do the math:

Right foot total = (300 * 3) + (200 * 2) = 900 + 400 = 1300 taps
Left foot total = (250 * 3) + (200 * 2) = 750 + 400 = 1150 taps

Now, we add the totals for both feet to get the combined total number of taps:

Combined total = Right foot total + Left foot total = 1300 + 1150 = 2450 taps

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of pizzas**: Bryce and his four friends each ordered a pizza, so there are 5 pizzas in total.
2. **Slices per pizza**: Each pizza has 12 slices.

Now, let's calculate how many slices each group of friends ate:

- **Bryce and two friends**:
  - Each of these three friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
  - Number of slices each of these three friends ate: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) slices.
  - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) slices.

- **The two remaining friends**:
  - Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
  - Number of slices each of these two friends ate: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \) slices.
  - Total slices eaten by the two remaining friends: \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten by all five friends:

- Total slices eaten: \( 24 + 18 = 42 \) slices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices available initially:

- Total slices available: \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) slices.

Finally, let's find out how many slices were left:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so we calculate the dog's time as follows:

\[ \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet and 4 inches can be converted as follows:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe (100 inches) is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):

\[ 9x = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9x = 90 \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- The total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.
- A quarter of the students' cars' windows is 256 windows * 1/4 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.
- Three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows is 64 windows * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars to the number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 windows (students) + 48 windows (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday.
2. Subtract the number of people who voted by midday from the total to find the number of people who had not voted by midday.
3. Calculate the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.
4. Subtract the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00 from the number of people who had not voted by midday to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Let's start with step 1:

1. By midday, 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted:
   \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \) people had voted.

2. The number of people who had not voted by midday is:
   \( 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \) people.

3. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dora's age is given as 15 years old.
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age as follows:
   - Twice Dora's age is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
   - Eight more than twice Dora's age is \(30 + 8 = 38\).
   Therefore, Dora's father is 38 years old.
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate Dora's mother's age as follows:
   - Dora's father's age is 38, so Dora's mother's age is \(38 - 4 = 34\).
   Therefore, Dora's mother is 34 years old.
4. To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
   - Dora's age: 15
   - Dora's father's age: 38

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now that we know the cost of both a gallon jar and a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 * Cost of a gallon jar
Total cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 * $5
Total cost of 10 gallon jars = $50

Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total amount spent = Total cost of 10 gallon jars + Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount spent = $50 + $48
Total amount spent = $98

- Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

Now, calculate the total number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:
- Total weekdays: 8 weeks * 5 weekdays/week = 40 weekdays
- Total weekends: 8 weeks * 2 weekend days/week = 16 weekend days

Next, calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- Chairs rented on weekdays: 40 weekdays * 60 chairs/weekday = 2400 chairs
- Chairs rented on weekends: 16 weekend days * 100 chairs/weekend day = 1600 chairs

Finally, sum the chairs rented on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented: 2400 chairs + 1600 chairs = 4000 chairs

"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many bananas Gunther had at the end:

1. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, increasing the total to \(24 + 25 = 49\) bananas.
4. Later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with \(49 - 12 = 37\) bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, bringing the total to \(37 + 6 = 43\) bananas.

So, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

"To find out how much each roommate, including Jenna, will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill.
2. Divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates to find the individual share.

First, the total annual cost of the electricity bill is:
\[ 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1200 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Next, since there are 4 roommates plus Jenna, making a total of 5 people, the cost per person is:
\[ 1200 \text{ dollars/year} \div 5 \text{ people} = 240 \text{ dollars/year per person} \]

So, each roommate, including Jenna, will pay:
\[ 240 \]

"To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glasses and plates initially sent.
2. Subtract the number of broken items from the total number sent.

First, we convert dozens to individual items:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we account for the broken items:
- 10 glasses were broken, so 96 - 10 = 86 glasses remain.
- 6 plates were broken, so 48 - 6 = 42 plates remain.

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:
- Total remaining items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

"To solve this problem, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Inventory:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 63 small buttons

8. **Total number of buttons:**
   - 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 92 buttons

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:

\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is equal to the total number of people on the council:

\[ F + A = 33 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, we can find \( F \) by substituting \( A \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):

\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of shirts for each size.

1. **Extra-small (XS):** 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S):** Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L):** Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of students needing size large is \(18 / 2 = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL):** Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can start by determining the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's use this information to find the total number of puppies. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = Total Pomeranians

We already know the total number of Pomeranians is 18, so:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs twice as many as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To find out how many fruits George has in total, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has based on the information that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

If George has 200 bananas, and he has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of the number of bananas)
Number of pears = 200 + (0.45 * 200)
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each:

20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We can subtract the amount he has already made from the eggplants to find out how much more he needs to make from the corn:

$135 total - $60 from eggplants = $75 needed from corn

Now, we can divide the amount he needs to make from the corn by the number of ears of corn he has to find out how much he should sell each ear for:

$75 needed / 25 ears of corn = $3 per ear of corn

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

   - A third of the 600 movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - Cost of these movies: Since he can get these for $6 each, the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Remaining Movies:**
   - Total movies: 600
   - Movies in series: 200
   - Remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for a total of 6 hours minus the 1.5 hours they spent hiking, which is 4.5 hours. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

Distance driven = Time driven * Speed
Distance driven = 4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 25 miles per hour, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour.

Distance hiked = Time hiked * Speed
Distance hiked = 1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Now, we can add the two distances to find the total distance to their vacation spot.

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of rides on the 5 days when they ride thrice a day, and the number of rides on the 2 days when they ride twice as much as on the usual days.

For the 5 days:
- They ride 3 times a day.
- So, for 5 days, the total number of rides is 5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides.

For the 2 special days:
- They ride twice the usual 3 times, which means 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day.
- So, for 2 days, the total number of rides is 2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides.

Adding the rides from the 5 days and the 2 special days together:
- Total rides in a week = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish.
3. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
- \( x + y = 17 \) (since he bought 17 fish in total).

After adding the new fish to his pond:
- The total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
- The total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, let's solve these equations.

First, expand the equation:
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]

Rearrange to isolate \( y \):
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation \( x + y = 17 \):
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify:
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \).
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).

Indeed, 16 is twice 8, so the solution is correct.

The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of workdays in a week to get the total weekly distance.
3. Determine the total amount of fuel used per week by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency.
4. Calculate the total cost of the fuel used per week by multiplying the total amount of fuel used by the price per gallon.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round trip (to and from work) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
2. The total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.
3. The total amount of fuel used per week is 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons/week.
4. The total cost of the fuel used per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

$15/week

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total amount of money from the twenties:
   Carrie was given ten twenties, so the total amount from the twenties is:
   \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the amount of money from the quarters:
   There are 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total amount from the quarters is:
   \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the amount of money spent from the twenties:
   Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, so the amount spent is:
   \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the total amount of money spent:
   The total amount spent is the sum of the money spent from the quarters and the twenties:
   \( 35 + 120 = 155 \) dollars.

The total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes per plant = 110 tomatoes

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
8 eggplant plants * 4 eggplants per plant = 32 eggplants

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to get the total number of fruits:
110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract that from the total number of TVs sold.

Given that:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The total number of TVs sold is 40.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs to find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold:
\[ \text{Total non-OLED TVs} = 10 + 5 = 15 \]

Finally, subtract the number of non-OLED TVs from the total number of TVs to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 = 25 \]

"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine the total amount he needs to raise for the trip. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate the school's contribution and then find out how much John needs to raise on his own.

The cost of the trip is $300, and the school is covering half of this cost:
\[ \text{School's contribution} = \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 \]

This means John needs to raise the other half of the cost:
\[ \text{John's required contribution} = 300 - 150 = 150 \]

John currently has $50, so the amount of money he is missing is:
\[ \text{Money missing} = 150 - 50 = 100 \]

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature during the night.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It is 33 degrees colder during the night, so the temperature at night is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees. The difference between the night temperature and the freezing point is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, so the number of logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people are split into groups of 9, we divide 90 by 9 to find the number of groups:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. So we calculate 3/5 of 10:

(3/5) * 10 = 6 groups

Each member of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Since each group has 9 members, we can find the total number of seashells brought back by multiplying the number of groups by the number of members in each group and then by the number of seashells each member brought:

6 groups * 9 members/group * 2 seashells/member = 108 seashells

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 108.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on. So, the change in the number of people is -47 + 13 = -34.
3. After the first stop, the number of people on the train is 172 - 34 = 138.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, the number of people on the train is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the number of people on the train after the second stop is 100.

2. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Daily value of bottle caps
- Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.
- Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.
- So, the daily value is 10 bottle caps * $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50.

Step 2: Monthly value of bottle caps
- There are 30 days in the month.
- The monthly value is 30 days * $2.50/day = $75.00.

Therefore, Damien makes $75.00 in a 30-day month.

"To calculate Jamie's pay for the day she worked 11 hours, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. Regular pay for 8 hours:
   $20/hour * 8 hours = $160

2. Overtime pay for 3 hours (11 hours total - 8 regular hours):
   Overtime rate is 150% of the regular rate, so:
   $20/hour * 150% = $30/hour
   $30/hour * 3 hours = $90

3. Total pay for the day:
   Regular pay + Overtime pay = $160 + $90 = $250

The total amount Jamie was paid for her work that day is $250.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid over three months.

Step 1: Determine the total number of employees after three months.
- Initial number of employees: 200
- New employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Total number of new employees hired in three months = 20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

Total number of employees after three months = Initial employees + New employees
= 200 + 60
= 260 employees

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
- Monthly salary per employee: $4000

Total monthly salary for all employees = Number of employees * Monthly salary per employee
= 260 employees * $4000/employee
= $1,040,000

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over three months.
Total amount paid over three months = Total monthly salary * Number of months
= $1,040,000 * 3
= $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000.

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to calculate their current hourly rates and then compute their earnings for 20 hours of work.

1. **Billy's hourly rate:**
   - Starting rate: $10.00 per hour
   - After 2 months, raise: $0.50 per hour
   - On his first anniversary, raise: $1.00 per hour

   Billy's current hourly rate = $10.00 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour

2. **Sally's hourly rate:**
   - Sally's starting rate is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting rate.
   - Billy's starting rate: $10.00 per hour
   - Sally's starting rate: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

3. **Earnings for 20 hours:**
   - Billy's earnings for 20 hours: $11.50 * 20 = $230.00
   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours: $10.50 * 20 = $210.00

4. **Difference in earnings:**
   - Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings

"To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students each.
- So, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers each.
- So, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total collection, so we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we first calculate the total hours she has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Adding these two amounts gives the total hours played:
\[ 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, the distance it will cover is:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, the distance it will cover is:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be:
Difference = Distance of second car - Distance of first car
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth-graders, the number who passed is 400 * (80/100) = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students and the total number of students who passed:

- Total students: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students.
- Total students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700 students.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

Overall pass rate = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the total area that can be covered.

Step 1: Total number of glass chips
Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.
Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Step 2: Total area of mosaic
It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of mosaic.
Total area = Total chips / 12 chips per square inch
Total area = 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Step 3: Length of the mosaic
The mosaic is 3 inches tall, so to find the length, we divide the total area by the height.
Length = Total area / Height
Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by all the students together:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

We then add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea that was at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

Therefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower Rose picked, subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. For the first set of flowers: 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.

2. For the second set of flowers: 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.

3. For the third set of flowers: 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.

4. For the fourth set of flowers: 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Now, we add up all the petals before any are dropped:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

Since Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one flower from each set:
- 5 petals from the first set,
- 6 petals from the second set,
- 4 petals from the third set,
- 7 petals from the fourth set.

Total petals dropped:

"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

So, the total number of marshmallows used and lost is:
9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left is:
35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is equal to the number of marshmallows left, which is 14.

Since there are two kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows equally:
14 marshmallows / 2 kids = 7 S'mores per kid.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes with 1 quarter (half as long as Jack).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter (1.5 times as long as Jack).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

4. **Total Quarters Used:**

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \ \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \ \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( u \ \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \ \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = u \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + u + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Calculate the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he has \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars left.

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, and they each earned the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is:

8 hours / 2 = 4 hours

The total time walked over the two days in hours is:

8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

To convert the total time to minutes, we multiply the total hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the school parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars were added, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70 cars. When he got out of class for the lunch break, half of the cars had gone, so the number of cars that left is 70 / 2 = 35 cars. Therefore, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the number of cycles, tasks per cycle, and the pay per task.

1. First, calculate the earnings per cycle:
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Earnings per cycle = 5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00.

2. Next, calculate the daily earnings:
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Daily earnings = 30 cycles/day * $6.00/cycle = $180.00/day.

3. Finally, calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings = 7 days/week * $180.00/day = $1260.00/week.

So, John makes $1260.00 in a full 7-day week.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we first need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food.

For cat food:
8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins

For dog food:
6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food to find the difference:
88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards each person has in terms of PJ's cards. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards. According to the problem:

- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. To find out how many cards Becca has, we use the expression for Becca's cards:

\[ 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so:
   \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so:
   \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:
   \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs: \( 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 \)

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. Calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

Shipping cost = (Weight of book * Cost per pound) + (Distance * Cost per mile)
Shipping cost = (4 * $0.35) + (20 * $0.08)
Shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60
Shipping cost = $3.00

2. Calculate the refund amount:
- Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
- The book cost $32.

Refund amount = 75% of $32
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24.00

3. Calculate the total loss:
- The total loss is the cost of the book minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost.

Total loss = (Cost of the book - Refund amount) + Shipping cost
Total loss = ($32 - $24) + $3
Total loss = $8 + $3
Total loss = $11

"To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items she needs installed beyond what is included in the standard installation package.

The standard installation package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves (not needed by Angela)
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 additional mirrors)
- 2 chandeliers (1 additional chandelier)
- 20 pictures (10 additional pictures)

The additional items Angela needs installed are:
- 2 additional mirrors
- 1 additional chandelier
- 10 additional pictures

The cost for each additional item is $15.00. Therefore, the total number of additional items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 additional items

The cost for the additional items is:
13 items * $15.00/item = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the standard installation fee and the cost for the additional items:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height that each character can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given as 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Now, we need to convert Naruto's lifting height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered during each part of his journey and then add those distances together.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled during the first part of his journey:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_1 = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

After taking some rest, he continues his journey for another 6 hours at the same speed:
Distance_2 = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

First, let's establish the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance \(D\) is the same for all animals. The speed of one kangaroo, \(S_k\), can be calculated as the distance \(D\) divided by the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel that distance. However, since the problem does not specify the distance, we can use the total time and the number of kangaroos to find the effective speed of a single kangaroo.

The total time for 3 kangaroos to travel the distance is 18 hours. If we consider the distance \(D\) and the speed of one kangaroo \(S_k\), the time for one kangaroo to travel the distance would be:

\[ \text{Time for one kangaroo} = \frac{D}{S_k} \]

Since 3 kangaroos together take 18 hours, the effective speed of 3 kangaroos together is:

\[ 3 \times S_k = \frac{D}{18} \]

So, the speed of one kangaroo is:

\[ S_k = \frac{D}{3 \times 18} = \frac{D}{54} \]

Now, the speed of a turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle \(S_t\) is:

\[ S_t = \frac{1}{2} \times S_k = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{D}{54} = \frac{D}{108} \]

If we have 4 turtles, their combined speed is:

\[ 4 \times S_t = 4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27} \]

The time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \(D\) is:

\[ \text{Time for 4 turtles} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after the trade-in, her part-time job pay, and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

The cost of the new laptop after the trade-in is:
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has received the following amounts:
- Part-time job pay: $150
- Contribution from mom: $80

The total amount Erika has received from these sources is:
$150 + $80 = $230

Erika still needs $50 more to buy the laptop, which means the total amount she has, including the money in her purse, is:
$400 - $50 = $350

To find out how much money is in her purse, we subtract the amount she has received from other sources from the total amount she has:
$350 - $230 = $120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left after Adam eats 15 slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he gets from slicing 3 large and 5 small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples will give:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will give:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current cows and then find the difference needed to reach the target.

1. The farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The total milk production from the 3 cows is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.
3. The target milk production is 25 liters a day.
4. The additional milk needed to reach the target is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters a day.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total, we can subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students:

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal.
- Time (T) = 3 years

1. **White Shirts with Collars**: Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is:
   \[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

2. **White Shirts with No Collars**: The remaining white shirts do not have collars, so the number of white shirts with no collars is:
   \[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons**: We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons**: The total number of floral shirts is 50, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
   \[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

5. **Difference in Quantity**: To find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
   \[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sales and then add those numbers together.

Starting with Farm X:
- Mr. Smith originally has 55 goats.
- He sold 10 goats.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45 goats.

For Farm Y:
- Mr. Smith originally has 45 goats.
- He sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25 goats.

Adding the goats left in both farms:
- Goats left in Farm X + Goats left in Farm Y = 45 + 25 = 70 goats.

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the total number of pairs of shoes bought in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs bought:
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110.

1. Determine the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the total rooms.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean these rooms in minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Number of rooms to clean
- Total rooms: 90
- One-half of the rooms: 90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Step 2: Total time required to clean 45 rooms
- Time to clean one room: 20 minutes
- Total time for 45 rooms: 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

Step 3: Convert minutes to hours
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Total time in hours: 900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes, and then double this amount, which is \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up the total number of homes built over the three years:

\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

"Let's denote your age as \( Y \), your brother's age as \( B \), and your sister's age as \( S \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \)
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \)
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \)

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Y \) using the second relationship:
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Next, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) using the first relationship:
\[ B = Y + 3 \]

Now, we can express \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) using the third relationship and the expression for \( B \):
\[ M = 3B - 1 = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \]

Now we substitute \( B \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) into the fourth relationship:
\[ Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6Y = 78 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old.

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to meet this need. We divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

7 packs"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial amount of water**: 4000 gallons.
2. **After heavy rain (day 2)**: The amount of water doubles, so it becomes 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.
3. **On the third day**: The volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, the total amount of water on the third day is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial ten people infected on day 0.

- **Day 0**: 10 people are initially infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people is now \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Each of the 70 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people is now \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Each of the 490 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people is now \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Therefore, after three days, the total number of people infected is 3430.

"To find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we first need to calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received and then determine how much less Julieta received.

Rafaela received a $20 tip from each of the forty customers. So, the total amount of tips Rafaela received is:
\[ 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:
\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total gives us Julieta's total tips:
\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips both received, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:
\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In 1 year, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in 1 year is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \).

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate how many burritos were consumed and subtract that from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, let's calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Next, we account for the burritos Mr. George ate:
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Now, we add the burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George to find the total number of burritos consumed:
- Total burritos consumed = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos.

Finally, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:
- Total burritos ordered = 600 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 520 burritos.
- Total leftover burritos = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos.

"To find out how many yellow cars the bumper car rink has, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so there are \(10 \times 3 = 30\) blue cars.
4. The total number of cars is 75.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars to find out how many yellow cars there are:

- Red cars: 12
- Green cars: 10
- Blue cars: 30

Total of red, green, and blue cars: \(12 + 10 + 30 = 52\)

The number of yellow cars is the total number of cars minus the number of red, green, and blue cars:

\(75 - 52 = 23\)

So, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.
Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

18 glasses (boys' sales) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

1. **Cost of bacon**: 5 packs at $10 in total.
   - Total cost of bacon = $10

2. **Cost of chicken**: 6 packets, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2
   - Cost of one packet of chicken = $2 * 2 = $4
   - Total cost of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24

3. **Cost of strawberries**: 3 packs at $4 each.
   - Total cost of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12

4. **Cost of apples**: 7 packs, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of strawberries = $4

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first subtract the time of the encore from the total runtime of the final concert. The final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes long. The encore itself is 15 minutes long.

So, the length of the final concert without the encore is:
65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert (excluding the encore) is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the length of the final concert (excluding the encore) by 2.

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the speed of a whirligig is based on the speed of a thingamabob.

We know that:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \) meters per second. Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ T = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ T = 11 \]

So, a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig \( W \) is:

\[ W = 5T \]
\[ W = 5 \times 11 \]
\[ W = 55 \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, let's break down the costs of her daily diet.

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily food, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Since she eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The cost of one carrot every day is $1.

"To calculate Mark's weekly earnings after the pay raise, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Mark's new hourly wage: His original wage was $10 per hour, and he received a $2 raise, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.
2. Calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week: He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week.
3. Calculate Mark's weekly earnings: Multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week, which is $12 * 40 = $480.

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payments for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

2. **Calculate the payments for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Determine the total payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6J \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \) dollars.
   - Total payment for mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + 54J = 80 \).

5. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since Joe paid $6, and we need to find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we need to find \( J \).
   - We know that \( 54J \) is the total amount earned from mowing lawns, and the total earnings are $80.
   - We can solve for \( J \) by setting up the equation: \( 54J = 80 - L \).

6. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Since \( J \) must be a whole number and the total earnings are $80, we need to find a value of \( J \) that makes \( 54J \) a reasonable amount.
   - If \( J = 1 \), then \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) dollars from mowing lawns.
   - Therefore, \( L = 80 - 54 = 26 \) dollars from lemonade sales.

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To find out how much profit John makes on his car, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting out his car and then subtract his car payment from that amount.

First, let's calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
- John rents his car 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- He gets paid $25 per hour.

Total hours rented per month = 10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours
Total earnings per month = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

So, John's profit from renting out his car is $250.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Martha originally had \( M \) notebooks.
2. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.
3. Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. So, \( M + 5 = 7 \).

From the equation \( M + 5 = 7 \), we can solve for \( M \):

\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had:

\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

Additional distance Anis rowed = 50 miles * 1/5 = 10 miles

So, the total distance Anis rowed is:

Total distance Anis rowed = 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles

Now, we can calculate the total distance both of them rowed by adding the distances each rowed:

Total distance rowed = Distance Dijana rowed + Distance Anis rowed
Total distance rowed = 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Pages read yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel did not read any pages today, so he read 0 pages.

3. **Total pages read:**
   - Denise's total pages read: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
   - Daniel's total pages read: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

4. **Difference in pages read:**
   - The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total capacity of the pot in terms of bowls:**
   - The pot can hold enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for dinner:**
   - Calvin (1 adult bowl)
   - Calvin's wife (1 adult bowl)
   - Two children (2 child bowls)
   - Total bowls needed for dinner: 1 (Calvin) + 1 (wife) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls

3. **Convert the total bowls needed for dinner into the pot's capacity:**
   - Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total bowls needed for dinner in terms of child bowls is:
     - 1 (Calvin) * 2 (child bowls per adult bowl) + 1 (wife) * 2 (child bowls per adult bowl) + 2 (children) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 child bowls

4. **Determine the remaining soup after dinner:**
   - The pot can hold 8 child bowls.
   - 6 child bowls are used for dinner.
   - Remaining soup: 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls

5. **Calculate how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:**
   - There are 2 child bowls of soup left.
   - There are 2 children.
   - Each child can have: 2 child bowls / 2 children = 1 bowl per child

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup 1 time.

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
3. We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
5. Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( A - 4 \):
   \[
   26 = A - 4
   \]
6. Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30
   \]
7. Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

"To find out how many acres the two farms have together, we first need to calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 400 acres. Adding 100 acres to 400 acres gives us the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

Now, to find the total acreage of both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

So, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both contributed equally.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14
- Total cost = $28

Since this total amount was the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, and they both received the same amount, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each received:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2
- Allowance per person = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his total expenses for the month and then see how much he has left to spend.

First, let's calculate the cost of the movies he has already seen:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days at $7 each: 8 * $7 = $56

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy at $2 each: 4 * $2 = $8

Now, let's add up all his expenses so far:
- Movies: $50 + $56 = $106
- Snacks: $16 + $8 = $24
- Total expenses: $106 + $24 = $130

Colby's parents give him $150 per month, so let's see how much he has left:
- Remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for this will be:
- Movie ticket: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Candy: $2
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

Since the total for the night is exactly $20, which is the amount he has left, he can see one more movie.

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, and then add them together.

1. **Calories per mini cinnamon roll:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
   - Calories per mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

2. **Total calories for 200 mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Total calories = 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

3. **Calories per mini blueberry muffin:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one.
   - Calories per mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

4. **Total calories for 300 mini blueberry muffins:**
   - Total calories = 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

5. **Total calories for all pastries:**
   - Total calories = 40,000 calories (from cinnamon rolls) + 45,000 calories (from blueberry muffins) = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is again 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days:

300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day.

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, we calculate the distance the bus traveled:
Distance = Speed × Time
For the bus, the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 5 hours.
Distance (bus) = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, we calculate the distance the car traveled:
For the car, the speed is 30 miles per hour and the time is 8 hours.
Distance (car) = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
Difference = Distance (bus) - Distance (car)
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of toys Sophie already had and then subtract that total from the new total number of toys, which is 62.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Let's add these numbers together:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before the bouncy balls from the new total:

62 (total toys now) - 48 (toys before bouncy balls) = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
50

"To find out how many total balloons the girls had, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
2. At the start, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, and she had 1 for herself. So, the initial distribution is:
   - Each of the 4 friends gets 2 balloons: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
   - Maria has 1 balloon: \(1\) balloon.
   - Total initial balloons: \(8 + 1 = 9\) balloons.

3. Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people:
   - Each person gets 3 more balloons: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

4. Adding the initial balloons to the additional balloons:
   - Total balloons: \(9 + 15 = 24\) balloons.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

"To determine how many new tables the charity group needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes donated:**
   - 10 people each donate 5 boxes.
   - Total boxes donated = 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.

2. **Add the boxes they already have:**
   - They already have 10 boxes.
   - Total boxes = 50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already have) = 60 boxes.

3. **Determine the total number of tables needed:**
   - Each table can hold 2 boxes.
   - Total tables needed = Total boxes / Boxes per table = 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

4. **Calculate the number of new tables needed:**
   - They already own 15 tables.
   - New tables needed = Total tables needed - Tables they already own = 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats:
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. Calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep:
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total amount of hay needed:
   - Total hay = hay for goats + hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

Earnings = Hourly Rate * Hours Worked
Earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours
Earnings = 300 dollars

Next, we'll subtract the amount he spends on gas and the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:

Remaining Money = Earnings - Cost of Gas - Bank Deposit
Remaining Money = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 100 dollars
Remaining Money = 150 dollars

Now, we'll calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:

Cost of Pencils = Number of Pencils * Cost per Pencil
Cost of Pencils = 5 * 10 dollars
Cost of Pencils = 50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

Money After Pencils = Remaining Money - Cost of Pencils
Money After Pencils = 150 dollars - 50 dollars
Money After Pencils = 100 dollars

Finally, we'll determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the money he has left:

Number of Pens = Money After Pencils / Cost per Pen
Number of Pens = 100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen
Number of Pens = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - The time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - The rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \).
   - The time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D, respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. B + A + D = 45 (the total points scored by the team)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

From the second equation, we can express A in terms of B: A = B - 20.
From the third equation, we can express D in terms of B: D = B - 10.

Now we can substitute A and D in the first equation with their expressions in terms of B:

B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get:

3B - 30 = 45

Now, we solve for B:

3B = 45 + 30
3B = 75
B = 75 / 3
B = 25

Now that we know B (Bahati's score), we can find A (Azibo's score):

A = B - 20
A = 25 - 20
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated the number by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \). According to the problem, Courtney's count of 48 is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So we can write the equation as:
\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now we can calculate \( x \):
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Holes dug on the first day:** 10 holes
2. **Holes dug on the second day:** 13 holes
3. **Holes dug on the third day:** 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day are 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes by the end of the third day:

- Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:

- Total holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40 holes

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:

- Holes dug on the fourth day = 40 (total by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (total by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To find out how much the travel costs, we first need to calculate 50% of the total cost of the supplies and then add that to the original cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400. 

50% of $400 is calculated as follows:
50% of $400 = 0.50 * $400 = $200

The total cost for the travel tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies, so:
Total travel cost = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
Total travel cost = $400 + $200 = $600

The travel costs $600."
"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
2. Let \( S \) represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( W \) represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( A = S + 5 \)
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: \( S = 4W - 13 \)
- Together they have caught 339 Pokemon: \( A + S + W = 339 \)

First, substitute \( A \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the second equation into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4W - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( E \) be the number of episodes. According to the problem, \( E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = \( E \times \) length of each episode
Total time = \( 10 \times 20 \) minutes
Total time = \( 200 \) minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction, as the bird's final destination is her southern home.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we calculate the net distance traveled south:
- Total distance south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

Net distance south:
- \(410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\)

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. 1 dozen is equal to 12 brownies.
2. At her office, she was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. 1/2 dozen is equal to 6 brownies.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party. 4 dozen is equal to 48 brownies.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had:

12 (from her batch) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the party) = 66 brownies

Next, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:

66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington had initially:
- She bought 12 boxes of oranges.

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes.

Now, we find out how many boxes she had left after giving some away:
- 12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes.

Then, we determine how many boxes she kept for herself:
- She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 boxes.

Now, we calculate how many boxes she sold:
- She had 8 boxes left and kept 2, so she sold 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Finally, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
- Each box contains 20 oranges, so 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet**: Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower**: Each flower requires 1 foot of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each flower. Therefore, the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (flower)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many flowers can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/flower}} = 44.4 \text{ flowers}

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly savings for shoes.
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Step 2: Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
Jessica saves $500.00 each month, so in a year (12 months), she will save:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to saute, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}

   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down the information given:

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Church: 2 checks per month
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter (4 times a year)

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks for each category:

- Electric bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Gas bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Church: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Adding these together gives us the total number of checks Buford writes per year:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Determine the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Determine the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of their howls:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 120 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \(H\) years
- Wilfred: \(W\) years

The total age of the children is the sum of their ages:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children:
\[\text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]

Since Helene is twice this average:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests:**
   - There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
   - Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies were given to the church:**
   - The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church.
   - Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies.

3. **Calculate the number of people in the church who received cookies:**
   - Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
   - Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people.

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the size of the slices for the adults and the kids. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices. There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total watermelon is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), and since the whole watermelon is \( 8x \), the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments, and then subtract this from his total available time at the clinic.

1. **Time spent on rounds:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
   - Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Time spent on appointments:**
   - Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on rounds and appointments:**
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert total time spent to hours:**
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. **Time left for updating records:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 hours available at the clinic.
   - Time left = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 8 \):

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the number of sessions. However, the question does not specify the revenue or the fee charged per student per session, which is necessary to calculate earnings. Instead, I will calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost per student for the given conditions.

First, let's calculate the cost of renting the studio:
- The studio costs $25 per session.
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.
- Therefore, the total cost of renting the studio in a month is $25/session * 12 sessions/month = $300/month.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the students:
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- There are 10 students.
- The total cost for students per session is $1.50/student/session * 10 students = $15/session.
- The total cost for students in a month is $15/session * 12 sessions/month = $180/month.

Now, let's add the two costs together to get the total cost for the dance studio in a month:
- Total cost = Cost of renting the studio + Cost for students
- Total cost = $300 + $180 = $480

Since the question asks for the expected earnings and we only have the costs, we cannot provide the earnings without knowing the revenue. However, the total cost for the dance studio in a month is $480.

If you meant to ask for the total cost instead of earnings, the answer is:

$480"
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

For Peter:
- He has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- The number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \).

For Martha:
- She has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.
- The number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is \( \frac{56}{7} = 8 \).

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:
- \( 16 - 8 = 8 \).

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   - Number of female porcupines = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \).

2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Total number of babies born each month = 30 (female porcupines) × 4 (babies per female) = 120 babies.

3. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total number of babies born in a year = 120 (babies per month) × 12 (months) = 1440 babies.

4. **Calculate the total population after a year:**
   - Initial population = 50 porcupines.
   - Total population after a year = Initial population + Total number of babies born in a year.
   - Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{USD/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{USD} \]

The cost to fill the pool is:

"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is 9 (red sticks) + 5 = 14 blue sticks.
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 (blue sticks) - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34 sticks

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Matteo's time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Matteo traveled = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Shandy's time: 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Shandy traveled = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
- Difference = Distance Shandy traveled - Distance Matteo traveled
- Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day. The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, so Wanda pumped:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day, so Ms. B pumped:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - The total amount of water pumped on the first day is the sum of what Wanda and Ms. B pumped:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - On the second day, Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - The total amount of water pumped on the second day is the sum of what Wanda and Ms. B pumped:
     \[
     3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( x - 0.07x = 0.93x \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.93x - 0.07(0.93x) = 0.93^2x \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.93^2x - 0.07(0.93^2x) = 0.93^3x \).

   Given that the final charge is 28%, we have:
   \[
   0.93^3x = 0.28
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.93^3}
   \]
   \[
   x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( y - 0.09y = 0.91y \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.91y - 0.09(0.91y) = 0.91^2y \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^2y - 0.09(0.91^2y) = 0.91^3y \).
   - After 4 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^3y - 0.09(0.91^3y) = 0.91^4y \).
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^4y - 0.09(0.91^4y) = 0.91^5y \).

   Given that the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was 34.8%, we have:
   \[
   0.91^5y = 0.348
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.91^5}
   \]
   \[
   y \approx \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.558

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, we calculate Janet's total earnings per hour, which is the sum of her wages and tips:

$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour

Now, we calculate her total earnings per week, given that she works 40 hours a week:

$25 per hour * 40 hours = $1,000 per week

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:

$2,000 / $1,000 per week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up these amounts to find the total spent so far:

$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has to spend on plums is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can calculate the number of plums he can buy with the remaining money:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to first determine how many pictures were in each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 of the albums were selfies and 2 of the albums were portraits. So, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of pictures per album by the number of albums for each category:

Selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures
Portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures

Adding the selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of portraits and selfies:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is 45.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we can set up a proportion based on the information given. If James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages.

The proportion is as follows:
3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:
3x = 18 * 10
3x = 180
x = 180 / 3
x = 60

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total questions = 60
   - Easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24
   - The remaining questions are 60 - 24 = 36
   - Average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
   - Difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Easy questions correct = 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
   - Average questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9
   - Difficult questions correct = 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

3. **Sum the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct = 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes, and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

Next, the earnings from the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Now, let's add the earnings from both the cookies and cupcakes to get the total earnings:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
2 sisters * $10/sister = $20

Finally, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings to find out how much money Suzanne has left:
$320 - $20 = $300

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in 30 days:**
   - One dwarf can mine \(36\) pounds per day.
   - In 30 days, one dwarf can mine \(36 \times 30 = 1080\) pounds of ore.

3. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:**
   - If one dwarf can mine \(1080\) pounds in 30 days, then 40 dwarves can mine \(1080 \times 40 = 43200\) pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the pricing pattern based on the information given for the other two packages.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, which means the cost per sandwich is:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, which also means the cost per sandwich is:
\[ \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.5. Therefore, for 8 sandwiches, the cost would be:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he would not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. This is a 50% chance.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher is present, there is a 40% chance she will give an extension to the whole class.
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension to the whole class (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension.

Let's calculate the probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is present:

- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension to the whole class: 40% or 0.40
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension to the whole class but Marcus getting a personal extension: 60% * 20% = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12 or 12%

So, the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is present is:
0.40 + 0.12 = 0.52 or 52%

Now, we combine the probabilities for both scenarios (substitute teacher and normal teacher):

- Probability of not having to turn in homework with a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of not having to turn in homework with the normal teacher: 50% * 52% = 0.50 * 0.52 = 0.26 or 26%

Total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:
0.50 + 0.26 = 0.76 or 76%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
100% - 76% = 24%

"To determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we first need to calculate the total number of seats available for guests after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

The total number of seats in the Fine Arts Center is 6000. We subtract the seats for graduates and faculty:

6000 (total seats) - 950 (seats for graduates) - 300 (seats for faculty) = 4750 (seats for guests)

Next, we divide the number of guest seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive:

4750 (seats for guests) / 950 (graduates) = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total pay Melissa receives for the 3 days of jury duty.
2. Calculate the total expenses for parking over the 3 days.
3. Subtract the total expenses from the total pay to find the net pay.
4. Divide the net pay by the total number of hours spent on jury duty to find the pay per hour.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total pay = $15/day * 3 days = $45
2. Total parking expenses = $3/day * 3 days = $9
3. Net pay = Total pay - Total parking expenses = $45 - $9 = $36

"To determine how long it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place and the time it will take to move between them.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he doesn't need to move to reach it.
   - He needs to move from the first bottle to the second, second to the third, and so on, up to the eighth bottle.
   - Number of moves = 8 bottles - 1 = 7 moves.
   - Each move takes 5 seconds.
   - Total time for moves = 7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the lost income, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the lost income:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Lost income over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Lost income
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

So, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, he won $11 on the second race.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 on the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.5. So, he lost $16.5 on the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race loss: $5
- Second race win: -$11 (this is a win, so it reduces the total loss)
- Third race loss: $16.5

Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.5 = $11.5

Since there were 3 races, we divide the total loss by 3 to find the average loss per race:
Average loss = Total loss / Number of races = $11.5 / 3

Now, let's calculate the average loss:
Average loss = $11.5 / 3 = $3.8333...

Rounded to two decimal places, the average loss is $3.83.

2. Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days worked is:
   \( 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \)

2. Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.

3. There are 24 hours in a day, so \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day is:

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
   120 + 20 = 140 people on the train.
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off and twice that number (100 people) board the train:
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people on the train.
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off the train:
   190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, let's break down the costs of each item she bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear.

"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

The normal cost of insurance is $120 a month. After the accident, the cost is 60% more than the normal cost.

First, calculate the 60% increase:
60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72

So, the increased monthly cost is:
$120 + $72 = $192

Now, to find the annual cost, multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:
$192 * 12 = $2,304

Therefore, James pays $2,304 a year for insurance.

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we first need to calculate the number of loads he does each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

For the twin beds:
- He has 4 twin beds, and the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so he needs 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.

For the king size bed:
- He has 1 king size bed, and the machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so he needs 1 load for the king size bed.

In total, each week he does 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads of laundry.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads in a year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Therefore, for one feeding, the total amount of food consumed is \( 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams} \).

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, the total daily consumption is:
   - \( 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \).

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:
   - \( 720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days} \).

The 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - There were 4 pizzas, and each pizza had 8 slices.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total slices eaten (31) is less than the total slices available (32), the calculation is consistent.

The total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of big coupons:
- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons will be \(700 \times 2 = 1400\).

Next, we calculate the cost for the small coupons:
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is \(700 \times 5 = 3500\) cents.

Then, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is \(1400 \times 15 = 21000\) cents.

Finally, we add the costs for the small and big coupons to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost for small coupons + cost for big coupons = \(3500 + 21000 = 24500\) cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = \(24500 \div 100 = 245\) dollars.

Each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales and the truck picks up 3 bales. So, the net number of bales added to the field each hour is:

5 bales made - 3 bales picked up = 2 bales added per hour

Since the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, the total number of bales left in the field at the end of the day is:

2 bales added per hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the weekdays and the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total minutes spent in class during the weekdays:
- John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, which makes 8 classes a day.
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
- He goes to class for 5 days a week.

Total minutes in class during the weekdays:
8 classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:
- He spends 1/16 of his weekly class minutes on each of these days.

Extra learning time on Saturday:
1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes

Extra learning time on Sunday is the same:
100 minutes

Total extra learning time on the weekend:
100 minutes + 100 minutes = 200 minutes

Now, we add the weekday class time to the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:
1600 minutes/week + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes/week

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours:
1800 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours/week

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is:
   \[ \text{Initial height} = 3 \times 24 \text{ feet} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

2. Determine the height of the first bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so:
   \[ \text{Height of first bounce} = 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

3. Calculate the height of the second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of the height of the first bounce, so:
   \[ \text{Height of second bounce} = 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

The ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.
2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.
3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to first determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Next, we calculate the earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left after the velociraptors had their share.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, before the velociraptors ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is the other half that the T-Rex did not eat. This means the triceratops originally had 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken can from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them being shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total (2 shaken and 8 unshaken).

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas left divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ P(\text{shaken}) = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas left}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ P(\text{shaken}) \times 100 = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\% \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

In 3 hours, the second train will have traveled:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days he volunteers between March 1st and April 19th, taking into account the days he takes off.

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:
   - March has 31 days.
   - From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
   - Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

2. Calculate the number of days Billy takes off:
   - He takes 20% of the days off.
   - 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

3. Calculate the number of days Billy volunteers:
   - Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

4. Calculate the number of people Billy helps per day:
   - He helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.
   - People helped per day = 2 * 3 = 6 people.

5. Calculate the total number of people helped:
   - People helped per day * Number of volunteer days = 6 * 40 = 240 people.

"To find out how old Jeff is, we can start by determining Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4 years
Martha's age = 24 years - 4 years
Martha's age = 20 years

Now that we know Martha is 20 years old, we can find out Jeff's age. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10 years
Jeff's age = 20 years + 10 years
Jeff's age = 30 years

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day and then multiply by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total break and lunch time per day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks * 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Now, convert the total time per day into hours:
60 minutes = 1 hour

Next, calculate the total time over 5 days:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's miles = 3.5 * Amber's miles
Micah's miles = 3.5 * 8
Micah's miles = 28

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( x \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).
4. We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]
\[ x = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ x = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now that we know the total number of students is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, you need to add up the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

There are three women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for the 4-inch heels is:
3 women * 4 inches/woman = 12 inches

There are three women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for the 2-inch heels is:
3 women * 2 inches/woman = 6 inches

The total height of all the heels is:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

The total number of women is:
3 women + 3 women = 6 women

The average height of the heels is the total height divided by the number of women:
18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and then figure out how many miles she plans to hike each day.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will hike:

125 miles/hike * 2 hikes/day = 250 miles/day

Now, let's calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:

250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and the distance she will cover at her current plan is:

9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:

1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house.
2. Double that distance to account for the round trip.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month.

Step 1: One-way distance
Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the one-way distance using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 2: Round trip distance
The round trip distance is twice the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 3: Monthly distance
John visits his parents twice a month, so the total monthly distance is:
\[ \text{Monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Total toys needed**: 400 toys.
2. **Toys still needed after the shift**: 20 toys.
3. **Toys produced during the shift**: 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- **Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each**:
  - Total production per hour for these two workers: 2 * 6 = 12 toys.
  - Total production for their 10-hour shift: 12 * 10 = 120 toys.

- **Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each**:
  - Total production per hour for these two workers: 2 * 4 = 8 toys.
  - Total production for their 10-hour shift: 8 * 10 = 80 toys.

Adding the production of the first four workers:
- Total production by the four workers: 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the total production during the shift was 380 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
- Total production by the fifth worker: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the production rate of the fifth worker is:
- Toys per hour for the fifth worker: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first determine what half the circumference of the earth is. The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be:

40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Now, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The fastest car goes 750 mph."
"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, he was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Now, solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four**: 56 eggs.
2. **Total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: 30 eggs.
3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline**: Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline together is \(56 - 30 = 26\) eggs. Since they painted the same number, each of them painted \(26 \div 2 = 13\) eggs.

4. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**:
   - Let \(S\) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted \(S + 12\) eggs.
   - Together, they painted 30 eggs, so \(S + (S + 12) = 30\).

5. **Solve for \(S\)**:
   - \(2S + 12 = 30\)
   - \(2S = 18\)
   - \(S = 9\)

   So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \(9 + 12 = 21\) eggs.

6. **How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?**:
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \(21 - 13 = 8\).

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds.

First, let's determine how many boxes Nik will need. Since he has 200 crayons and each box holds 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight in ounces:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

"First, we need to determine how much of the tree can be used for logs. Since John can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate:

80 feet * 80% = 64 feet of usable wood.

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be made from the 64 feet of usable wood:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.

From each of these logs, John cuts 5 planks:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling each plank for $1.2:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.

So, John makes $96.

"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:
   \[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

2. Calculate their combined salary:
   \[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

3. Determine how much their mother earns, which is twice their combined salary:
   \[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

4. Add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, which includes the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's walking speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

For the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. We know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the speed on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

1. Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far:
   - Jane saves $4 every week.
   - She has been saving for 8 weeks.
   - Total saved so far = $4 * 8 = $32.

2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
   - Total goal = $60.
   - Amount already saved = $32.
   - Amount needed = $60 - $32 = $28.

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the additional $28:
   - She saves $4 per week.
   - Number of weeks needed = $28 / $4 = 7 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by figuring out how many marbles Bob has initially.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob has initially:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a mixture that is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water. The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[ \text{Mixture Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

We know that the mixture temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ 4 \times 33 + T \geq 40 \times 5 \]
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these increases to the initial numbers:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:
470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find out how much each single bagel costs after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total cost after the discount.
4. Divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[ 4 \times 10.00 = 40.00 \]

2. The discount is 10% of the total cost:
   \[ 10\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.10 \times 40.00 = 4.00 \]

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted total:
   \[ 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00 \]

4. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

5. The cost per bagel is the total discounted cost divided by the total number of bagels:
   \[ \frac{36.00}{36} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per bagel after the discount is $1.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which is:
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's simplify this:
3 less than 6 potatoes is:
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes

1 less than 3 scoops is:
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion to solve this:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Cross-multiplying gives us:
2x = 3 * 18
2x = 54
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he will consume.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 passengers (5 men + 9 women), 5 are men and 9 are women. The total number of passengers is 84, so we can find out how many groups of 14 are in 84 by dividing 84 by 14.

84 passengers / 14 passengers per group = 6 groups

Since there are 6 groups and each group has 9 women, the total number of women on the bus initially is:

6 groups * 9 women per group = 54 women

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

54 women - 20 women = 34 women

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold and the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets, and then add these quantities together.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

For 3 days, the number of individual sunflowers sold is:
- 13 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers.

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets per day is:
- 7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

For 3 days, the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets is:
- 84 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers.

Finally, the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is the sum of the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers sold in bouquets:
- 39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of babies in each color group:**
   - Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
   - 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) babies.
   - 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) babies.

2. **Determine the number of babies wearing bows:**
   - All 2 blue-wearing babies also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearing babies also wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) babies.

3. **Calculate the total number of babies wearing bows:**
   - Total babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

4. **Determine the number of babies wearing both a bow and purple:**
   - 2 purple-wearing babies also wear bows.

5. **Calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - Probability = (Number of purple-wearing babies with bows) / (Total number of babies with bows)
   - Probability = \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)

6. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - Percentage = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \)

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to break down the sales step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it, which is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - He earns $50 from this sale.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells 1/4 of the remaining land, which is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - He earns $30 from this sale.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.
   - The earnings from this sale are \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Adding up all the earnings: \( 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \) dollars.

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn a total of $170 after selling all his unused land.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

Step 1: The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two, so it has:
\[ 400 \times 1.60 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Step 2: The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

Step 3: John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections in a week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

Step 4: John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

- At 5 years old, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- At 6 years old, the tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- At 7 years old, the tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- At 8 years old, the tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces first.
- At 9 years old, the tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it's 0 fruits.
- At 10 years old, the tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can determine the number of fruits produced at 8 years old:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, so an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Finally, we sum up the fruits produced each year from 5 to 10 years old:
- 5 years: 50 fruits
- 6 years: 150 fruits
- 7 years: 350 fruits
- 8 years: 800 fruits
- 9 years: 0 fruits
- 10 years: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much money Rissa gave to her little sister. According to the problem, after giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount.

3. Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
4. According to the problem, \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).

Let's solve for \( x \):

\[
15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
\]

\[
15 - x = 12
\]

\[
x = 15 - 12

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into two main parts: the yellow part and the part that is not yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the other half is made up of red, white, and purple paint.
3. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of this, which is the yellow part, is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.
4. The remaining half of the mural, which is also 6 pints, is divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints.
5. Since these three colors are in equal amounts, each color (red, white, and purple) uses 6 / 3 = 2 pints.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod for the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Total goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

Adding the goals from both teams gives us the total number of goals scored in the match:
6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals.

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can solve this system by substitution. First, solve the second equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 3(C + 25) \]

Now substitute \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]

Expand and simplify:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will consume and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Therefore, 6 friends will eat \(6 \times 6 = 36\) slices of cheese pizza.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
- Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Therefore, 6 friends will eat \(6 \times 4 = 24\) slices of pepperoni pizza.

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza:

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(36 \div 12 = 3\) cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(24 \div 8 = 3\) pepperoni pizzas.

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together:
- Total number of pizzas needed = 3 (cheese) + 3 (pepperoni) = 6 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour, which is 5 snowballs every 15 minutes (since 20 divided by 4 is 5).

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, the net increase in the number of snowballs every 15 minutes is:
5 (made) - 2 (melted) = 3 snowballs.

To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net increase per 15-minute interval:
60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:
20 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 300 minutes.

To convert this into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - After using 38 bandages and adding 50, the number of bandages at the end of the first day is \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \).

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - The number of bandages at the end of the second day is \( (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16 \).

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - The number of bandages at the end of the third day is \( (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59 \).

4. **Final Condition:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
   - Therefore, \( x + 59 = 78 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x + 59 = 78 \)
   - \( x = 78 - 59 \)
   - \( x = 19 \)

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find out how much May's haircut and color cost, we need to calculate the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut separately and then add them together.

The cost of the color is a flat rate of $40.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means 2 inches were cut off.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Now, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:

$40 (color) + $60 (haircut) = $100.

The total cost for May's cut and color is $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, we calculate her earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour = 67.5 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $101.25/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
$101.25/week * 4 weeks = $405

Next, we add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
- Since she had no absences for all 4 weeks, she receives the bonus 4 times.

So, her total attendance bonus for April is:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Now, we add her monthly earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
$405 + $40 = $445

Therefore, Jen will receive $445 in April.

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he completed the task and then sum these amounts.

- Laundry: $3.00 * 1 = $3.00
- Cleaning his room: $1.50 * 1 = $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, we add up all the amounts:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark would have:

3 * 40 gallons = 120 gallons

Now, to find out how much blood ten sharks have, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten:

120 gallons * 10 = 1200 gallons

So, ten sharks have 1200 gallons of blood.

"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we can break down the problem into parts and add up the numbers:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (in the morning) had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after a while) + 150 (evening) = 320

"To find out how many pens Alain has, let's break down the information:

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
2. She bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens, which means she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens.
3. Each pack contains 5 pens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pens:

- Red pens: 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens
- Black pens: 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 pens

Total pens = Red pens + Black pens = 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens

"First, let's calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:
Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost of scotch / Number of bottles
Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10
Cost per bottle of scotch = $60

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys:
Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch
Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10
Number of bottles of cognac = 20

Now, let's calculate the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% of cost per bottle of scotch)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

Then, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:
Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac
Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90
Total cost of cognac = $1800

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find out how much John spends on everything:
Total spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
Total spent = $600 + $1800
Total spent = $2400

"Let's break down the information given and calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days.

On the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(20 \times 2 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total for White Oak trees on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 more would be \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\) additional trees. Therefore, on the second day, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add up all the trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\(50 + 90 = 140\)

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much root beer was available for each person at the party.

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \( 20 - 7 = 13 \) gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and including Fred, there were 4 people in total. The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among the 4 people.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{4 \text{ people}} = 2 \text{ gallons per person} \]

So, each person had 2 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Determine the number of remaining fish after accounting for the red-striped fish.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of red-striped fish and blue-striped fish to get the total.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]
So, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

Step 2: Determine the number of remaining fish.
Subtract the number of red-striped fish from the total number of fish:
\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]
So, there are 44 fish remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes.
5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]
So, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

Step 4: Add the number of red-striped fish and blue-striped fish.
\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, which totals:
   2 palettes * 4 colors/palette = 8 colors

2. She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, which totals:
   3 sets * 6 colors/set = 18 colors

3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors from the palettes. The remaining colors from the palettes are:
   8 colors - 4 colors = 4 colors

4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is:
   6 colors / 2 = 3 colors

5. The remaining colors from the makeup sets after using up half of one set are:
   18 colors - 3 colors = 15 colors

6. The total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is the sum of the remaining colors from the palettes and the makeup sets:
   4 colors + 15 colors = 19 colors

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is \(7 \times 60 = 420\) inches.
3. The height of the first floor (from the ground to the first floor ceiling) is thrice Mattison's height, which is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) inches.

The height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors. Since we know the total height of the house and the height of the first floor, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Total height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} \]
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 240 inches.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance walked by the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. This means the total distance walked by all 4 dogs combined is 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

We know the distances for the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these distances together gives us 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance all four dogs need to walk:
12 miles (total) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"First, we need to calculate the amount of the loan John gets, which is 40% of the value of his home.

Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
Loan amount = 0.40 * $250,000
Loan amount = $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.

Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = 0.60 * $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = $60,000

Now, we can find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts.

Money leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
Money leftover = $100,000 - $60,000
Money leftover = $40,000

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The selling price is 11/8 of the buying price. If the buying price is $72, then the selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so 2 * 1 liter/day = 2 liters/day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so 2 * 2 liters/day = 4 liters/day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated and then find out how many of those he thought were red. We can then compare this to the true number of red jelly beans, which is 900.

First, we calculate the volume of the jar:
\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans, considering the 80% packing efficiency:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we determine the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his estimate from the true number:

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

"To find out how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the number of pounds of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds he needs for 80 meatballs, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. To find out how much seasoning he needs for 5 pounds, we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound:

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call with the given pricing structure, we need to break the call into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after the price drops.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - Cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. For the remaining 20 minutes (36 minutes total - 16 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute.
   - Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. The total cost of the call is the sum of the costs for both segments.
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of treats needed:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Total treats needed = 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
   - Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - Number of brownies = \( 3c - 2 \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - Total treats = Number of cupcakes + Number of brownies
   - \( c + (3c - 2) = 10 \)

4. **Solve the equation:**
   - Combine like terms: \( c + 3c - 2 = 10 \)
   - Simplify: \( 4c - 2 = 10 \)
   - Add 2 to both sides: \( 4c = 12 \)
   - Divide by 4: \( c = 3 \)

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a manicure and a pedicure with the 20% discount.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art.
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount:

- The cost of a manicure is $35.
- The cost of a pedicure is $40.
- The total cost without discount is $35 + $40 = $75.
- The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.
- The discounted cost is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the nail art:

- Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails.
- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- The total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:

- Total cost = $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can start by setting up the relationships described in the problem with the information given.

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so we can express the number of paintings Shelley has as \( K + 8 \).

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know that Samantha has 27 paintings. So, we can express the number of paintings Samantha has as \( (K + 8) - 12 \).

Since we know Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:

\[ (K + 8) - 12 = 27 \]

Now, let's solve for \( K \):

\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas this 3600 km represents. We can do this by using the following formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100

Plugging in the numbers we have:
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100

Now, let's calculate the percentage:
Percentage covered = (0.6) * 100 = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books each bookcase can hold.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold:
   \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) books.

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
   \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) books.

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
   \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) books.

4. Adding up the books that all the shelves can hold gives us the total capacity of one bookcase:
   \( 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \) books.

5. To find out how many bookcases Elly needs for her 110 books, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
   \( 110 \div 55 = 2 \).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find out how much each stick of jerky costs in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the bag of beef jerky.
2. Divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in the bag to find the cost per stick.
3. Convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents.

Let's start with step 1. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it is $3.00 off, so the discounted price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Now, for step 2, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in the bag:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

This means each stick costs $0.50. For step 3, we convert this amount to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total after the first test.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to pass - Questions already correct = 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To solve this, let's break down the information:

- There are 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights (1 for each person).
- There are 8 rooms, so there are 2 flashlights per room, which totals 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms.
- For the candles, half of the rooms (which is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so 4 rooms * 4 small candles = 16 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms (also 4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so 4 rooms * 5 medium candles = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's add up all the flashlights and candles:

- Flashlights: 4 (personal) + 16 (rooms) = 20 flashlights
- Candles: 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles

"To solve this, let's break down the time it takes for John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the water requirements of the different groups of plants.

1. First, we calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water each:
   \(4 \text{ plants} \times 0.5 \text{ cups/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}\)

2. Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water each:
   \(8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups}\)

3. Then, we determine how many plants are in the last group. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining number of plants is:
   \(20 \text{ plants} - 12 \text{ plants} = 8 \text{ plants}\)

4. These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each:
   \(8 \text{ plants} \times 0.25 \text{ cups/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}\)

5. Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants:
   \(2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}\)

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel the distance on land and in water, and then sum these times to get the total time.

1. The total distance Phineas needs to travel is 200 yards.
2. Half of the distance is on land, which is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.
3. The other half of the distance is in water, which is also 100 yards.

Next, we calculate the time for each part of the journey:

- On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. The time to travel 100 yards on land is:
  \[ \text{Time on land} = \frac{\text{Distance on land}}{\text{Speed on land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

- In water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. The time to travel 100 yards in water is:
  \[ \text{Time in water} = \frac{\text{Distance in water}}{\text{Speed in water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the two times together to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on land} + \text{Time in water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The main phone costs $20.
2. Each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone, so each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.
3. There are four additional phones, so the total cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.
4. The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60.

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his speed talking training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate the new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM.**

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: 20 more people than the first day, so:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
   \]
3. **Third Day**: Twice the number of people as the second day, so:
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]
4. **Rest of the Week (4 days)**: Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw over these 4 days is:
   \[
   60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ people}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw over the entire week:
\[
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500
\]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

"To find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so it's 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:

20 (first 30 seconds) + 60 (second 30 seconds) + 80 (third 30 seconds) + 40 (fourth 30 seconds) + 10 (after heat) = 210

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of regular lemonade.
2. Calculate the number of lemons needed for the 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade.
3. Add the two quantities together to get the total number of lemons needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of lemons for 4 gallons of regular lemonade.**

- 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- 4 gallons of lemonade will require 4 cups of lemon juice.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Therefore, 4 cups of lemon juice will require \(4 \times 6 = 24\) lemons.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of lemons for 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade.**

- The extra tart lemonade is twice as tart, so it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.
- 1 gallon of regular lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, so 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade will require \(1 \times 2 = 2\) cups of lemon juice.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice, so 2 cups of lemon juice will require \(2 \times 6 = 12\) lemons.

**Step 3: Add the two quantities together.**

- 24 lemons for the 4 gallons of regular lemonade.
- 12 lemons for the 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade.
- Total lemons needed: \(24 + 12 = 36\).

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"To find out how many kilograms of dog food the kennel will need in a week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption for all the dogs and then multiply that by 7 days.

The daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms per German Shepherd = 15 kilograms

The daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms per Bulldog = 6 kilograms

The total daily consumption for all the dogs is:
15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms

The weekly consumption is:
21 kilograms per day * 7 days = 147 kilograms

So, the kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the value of the boat at the end of each year, taking into account the percentage it depreciates each year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Original value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 \times (1 - 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 \times (1 - 0.30) = 6300 \times 0.70 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 \times (1 - 0.20) = 4410 \times 0.80 = 3528 \)

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

"To find out how many pink candies there are, let's first determine the number of each color of candy mentioned:

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(54 \times 2 = 108\)
- Yellow candies: Half the amount of red candies, so \(54 \div 2 = 27\)

Now, let's add up the candies of the colors we know:

\[54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

\[232 - 189 = 43\]

"To find out how much Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stays and the cost of the bus rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of one night at the hotel is $80. Since Helen stayed for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel is:
3 nights * $80/night = $240

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is:
10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost for the bus rides is:
7 rides * $8/ride = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296

Therefore, Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels during that trip.

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will meditate for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- In one week, she practices yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will practice yoga for 300 minutes * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time spent = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

So, the total cost for the ice cream cones is $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Ryan has $13 left.

Finally, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we divide $13 by $6.50:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to add up the cost of the items each of them bought.

Ellen's purchases:
- A pair of leggings for $100
- A photo frame for $5

Total for Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- A pair of sunglasses for $30
- Two bathrobes at $100 each, so 2 * $100 = $200

Total for Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's totals together to find the overall total:
$105 (Ellen's total) + $230 (Lani's total) = $335

So, Ellen and Lani spent $335 in all.

"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we first need to determine the cost to produce one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and subtract the total cost to find the profit.

1. **Cost to produce one jar:**
   - Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
   - Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
   - Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
   - Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

2. **Total cost for 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

3. **Total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Selling price per jar = $50
   - Total revenue = 10 * $50 = $500

4. **Profit from selling 10 jars:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh works in a week.
2. Multiply the number of days he works in a week by the number of cars he services each day to find the total number of cars he services in a week.
3. Multiply the total number of cars he services in a week by the amount he gets paid per car to find his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks.

Let's do the math:

1. Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 7 - 2 = 5 days a week.
2. He services 3 cars a day, so in a week, he services 5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars.
3. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are 15 cars * $4/car = $60.
4. In 2 weeks, he makes 2 * $60 = $120.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes a day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes a day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days it takes to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes to be filled = 84 holes.
   - Net holes filled per day = 3 holes.
   - Number of days to fill all holes = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - 1 week = 7 days.
   - Number of weeks = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, and Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students, we can calculate Butler High School's enrollment as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract Butler High School's enrollment from Norman High School's enrollment:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of items Igor actually placed on the lab bench.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. Total items Igor placed on the lab bench: 29

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he will use for the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
4 legs/table * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws/table

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
4 tables * 8 screws/table = 32 screws

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws he will use from the total number of screws he has:
40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

So, James will have 8 screws left over.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is twice as far as Aaron ran. Therefore, Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa. Therefore, Vanessa's speed is 1/8 miles per minute / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3:

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line/foot of dock = 600 feet of line

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract this from the total required:

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:
   Total cost = $80

2. Calculate the total profit:
   Profit percentage = 25%
   Total profit = Total cost * (Profit percentage / 100)
   Total profit = $80 * (25 / 100)
   Total profit = $80 * 0.25
   Total profit = $20

3. Calculate the total selling price:
   Total selling price = Total cost + Total profit
   Total selling price = $80 + $20
   Total selling price = $100

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   Number of watermelons = 50
   Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
   Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
   Selling price per watermelon = $2

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.

The cost of the radiator after the discount is:
$400 * 20% = $400 * 0.20 = $80

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The cost of the mechanic's labor is:
$50 * 3 = $150

Now, let's add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = Cost of radiator + Cost of mechanic's labor
Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20, so we have:
   \[ C + K = 20 \]
3. The total number of legs is 70, so we have:
   \[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can substitute \( K = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
